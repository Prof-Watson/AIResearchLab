      COVID-19 caused by SARS-COV-2 first appeared in the Wuhan City of China and began to spread rapidly among people. Rapid progression of the outbreak has led to a major global public health problem of a potentially fatal disease. On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the pandemic as the sixth public health emergency of the world. Upon this, the whole country has started to take the necessary precautions. The new coronavirus uses membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into the cells, such as SARS-CoV, and mostly affects the respiratory tract. Symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever (93%), fatigue (70%), cough (70%), anorexia (40%) and dyspnoea (34.5%). The elderly and people with underlying chronic diseases are more susceptible to infection and higher mortality. Currently, a large number of drugs and vaccines studies are ongoing. In this review, we discussed the virology, epidemiological data, the replication of the virus, and its relationship with cardiovascular diseases on COVID-19 pandemics, treatment and vaccines. Thereby, this study aims to neatly present scientific data in light of many regarding literature that can be a clue for readers who research this disease prevention and treatment. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This review summarized current information on COVID-19 (epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical, laboratory, cardiovascular diseases, ACE2 and pharmacological agents) for researchers and reveals guiding data for researchers, especially in the field of cardiovascular system, pharmacology, dysregulation of cellular function in disease, molecular and cell biology and physiology in the regulation of tissue function in health and disease.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named 'coronavirus disease 2019' (COVID-19), which threatens human health and public safety. In this Review, we describe the basic virology of SARS-CoV-2, including genomic characteristics and receptor use, highlighting its key difference from previously known coronaviruses. We summarize current knowledge of clinical, epidemiological and pathological features of COVID-19, as well as recent progress in animal models and antiviral treatment approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss the potential wildlife hosts and zoonotic origin of this emerging virus in detail.

      Reliable antibody testing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to uncover the population-wide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is critical for making informed healthcare and economic decisions. Here we review different types of antibody tests available for SARS-CoV-2 and their application for population-scale testing. Biases because of varying test accuracy, results of ongoing large-scale serological studies, and use of antibody testing for monitoring development of herd immunity are summarized. Although current SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing efforts have generated valuable insights, the accuracy of serological tests and the selection criteria for the tested cohorts need to be evaluated carefully.

      Long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now recognized. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the terminology for this emerging chronic clinical syndrome, which includes long COVID, chronic COVID syndrome, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute COVID-19, and long-hauler COVID-19. In this review, I will use the term ""long COVID"". A review of the medical history and epidemiology of past pandemics and epidemics in modern literature review identifies common long-term post-infectious disorders, with the common finding of altered cognition. In the brain, the cerebral hypoxia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in ""brain fog"". Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome). There are similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the ""brain fog"" described in long COVID. During past viral epidemics and pandemics, a commonality of neural targets may have increased viral survival by conformational matching. The neurological and psychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or long COVID, may have emerged from neural effects that have emerged from an invertebrate and vertebrate virosphere. This review aims to present a historical overview of infections and disorders associated with neurological and psychiatric sequelae that have shown similarities with long COVID.

      The potential emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of escaping vaccine-generated immune responses poses a looming threat to vaccination efforts and will likely prolong the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the prevalence of beta coronaviruses circulating in animals and the precedent they have set in jumping into human populations indicates that they pose a continuous threat for future pandemics. Currently, only one therapeutic is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating COVID-19, remdesivir, although other therapies are authorized for emergency use due to this pandemic being a public health emergency. In this review, twenty-four different treatments are discussed regarding their use against COVID-19 and any potential future coronavirus-associated illnesses. Their traditional use, mechanism of action against COVID-19, and efficacy in clinical trials are assessed. Six treatments evaluated are shown to significantly decrease mortality in clinical trials, and ten treatments have shown some form of clinical efficacy.

      The SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus has caused the COVID-19 pandemic with over 35 million cases and over a million deaths worldwide as of early October 2020. The populations most affected are the elderly and especially those with underlying comorbidities. In terms of race and ethnicity, black and hispanic populations are affected at disproportionately higher rates. Individuals with underlying conditions that cause an immune-compromised state are considered vulnerable to this infection. The immune response is an important determinant in viral infections including coronaviruses, not only in the antiviral defense but also in the disease progression, severity, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease which also disproportionately afflicts black and hispanic populations. In lupus patients, an aberrant immune response is characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, and proinflammatory cytokines along with defective regulatory mechanisms, leading to immune-mediated damage to tissues. Lupus patients are often treated with immune-suppressants and therefore are immune-compromised and more susceptible to infections and may be vulnerable to coronavirus infection. While the anti-viral immune response is important to protect from coronavirus infection, an uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine response can lead to cytokine storm which causes damage to the lungs and other organs, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Better understanding of the underlying immune response and therapeutic strategies in lupus and COVID-19 is important to guide management of this deadly infectious disease in the context of lupus and vice-versa.

      COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and declared by the World Health Organization a global public health emergency. Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation. Our study contributes genetic, phylodynamic, and clinical correlation data about the exceptionally well-curbed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Uruguay, which furthers the understanding of disease patterns and regional aspects of the pandemic in Latin America.

      Asymptomatic individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been identified via nucleic acid testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, the epidemiologic characteristics and viral shedding pattern of asymptomatic patients remain largely unknown. In this study, serological testing was applied when identifying nine asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 who showed persistent negative RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and no symptoms of COVID-19. Two asymptomatic cases were presumed to be index patients who had cleared the virus when their close contacts developed symptoms of COVID-19. Three of the asymptomatic cases were local individuals who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients developed symptoms of COVID-19. This report presents the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection that were undetected on RT-PCR tests in previous epidemiologic investigations probably due to the transient viral shedding duration.

          Background:
        
      
      At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus tentatively named SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, a central city in China, was announced by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has become a major public health concern after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively. As of 29 October 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases had reached over 44 million worldwide, with more than 1.17 million confirmed deaths.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 infected patients usually present with severe viral pneumonia. Similar to SARS-CoV, the virus enters respiratory tract cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2. The structural proteins play an essential role in budding the virus particles released from different host cells. To date, an approved vaccine or treatment option of a preventive character to avoid severe courses of COVID-19 is still not available.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the present study, we provide a brief review of the general biological features of CoVs and explain the pathogenesis, clinical symptoms and diagnostic approaches regarding monitoring future infectivity and prevent emerging COVID-19 infections.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 28,285,700 with mortality that appears higher than for seasonal influenza. About 20% of COVID-19 patients have experienced cardiac involvement and myocardial infarction in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a worse prognosis. Furthermore, the widespread use of antiviral drugs can be linked to a worsening of heart function. Arrhythmias and hypertension have also been reported in patients with Covid-19. On the other hand, previous cardiac diseases are present in 30% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is uncertainty in the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists in the COVID-19 era. The mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 has been elucidated. It has been demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it is required for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the downregulation of ACE2 that may contribute to the severity of lung pathologies as well as the cardiac function. ACE2, a homolog of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts Ang II into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) that with its vasodilatory, antifibrotic, antihypertrophic effects counterbalances the negative effects of Ang II. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and AT1R blockers have been shown to upregulate the expression of ACE2. Based on the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was questioned although all scientific societies did not recommend discontinuation when clinically recommended. The BRACE CORONA, a phase 4, randomized study tested two strategies: temporarily stopping the ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for 30 days versus continuing ACE inhibitors/ARBs in patients who were taking these medications chronically and were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was also discussed. Therefore, the goal of this review is to summarize recent laboratory and clinical investigations concerning the use of ACEi and ARBs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The available data, based also on a randomized trial, suggest that ACEIs or ARBs, when clinically indicated, should be regularly used in the COVID-19 era.

      The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a source of significant morbidity and death worldwide, and effective treatments are urgently needed. Clinical trials have focused largely on direct antiviral therapies or on immunomodulation in patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. One therapeutic approach that remains to be clinically investigated is disruption of the host-virus relationship through amino acid restriction, a strategy used successfully in the setting of cancer treatment. Arginine is an amino acid that has been shown in nonclinical studies to be essential in the life cycle of many viruses. Therefore, arginine depletion may be an effective therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Several arginine-metabolizing enzymes in clinical development may be a viable approach to induce a low arginine environment to treat COVID-19 and other viral diseases. Herein, we explore the rationale for arginine depletion as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19.

      The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in December 2019 as the causative agent of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 has several distinctive features, including extensive multiorgan involvement with a robust systemic inflammatory response, significant associated morbidity and mortality, and prolonged persistence of viral RNA in the clinical specimens of infected individuals as detected by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. This review begins with an overview of SARS-CoV-2 morphology and replication and summarizes what is known to date about the detection of the virus in nasal, oropharyngeal, and fecal specimens of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, with a focus on the factors thought to contribute to prolonged detection. This review also provides a discussion on the infective potential of this material from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and convalescing individuals, to include a discussion of the relative persistence and infectious potential of virus in clinical specimens recovered from pediatric COVID-19 patients.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic with a great impact on social and economic activities, as well as public health. In most patients, the symptoms of COVID-19 are a high-grade fever and a dry cough, and spontaneously resolve within ten days. However, in severe cases, COVID-19 leads to atypical bilateral interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic thromboembolism, resulting in multiple organ failure with high mortality and morbidity. SARS-CoV-2 has immune evasion mechanisms, including inhibition of interferon signaling and suppression of T cell and B cell responses. SARS-CoV-2 infection directly and indirectly causes dysregulated immune responses, platelet hyperactivation, and endothelial dysfunction, which interact with each other and are exacerbated by cardiovascular risk factors. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the pathogenic basis of thromboinflammation and endothelial injury in COVID-19. We highlight the distinct contributions of dysregulated immune responses, platelet hyperactivation, and endothelial dysfunction to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms.

      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have a mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, a characteristic hyperinflammatory response, vascular damage, microangiopathy, angiogenesis and widespread thrombosis. Four stages of COVID-19 have been identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection; the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia; the third by a worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state; and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this emergency period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.

      A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), B.1.1.529 (Omicron) (1), was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by South Africa on November 24, 2021. Omicron has numerous mutations with potential to increase transmissibility, confer resistance to therapeutics, or partially escape infection- or vaccine-induced immunity (2). On November 26, WHO designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern (3), as did the U.S. SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG)* on November 30. On December 1, the first case of COVID-19 attributed to the Omicron variant was reported in the United States. As of December 8, a total of 22 states had identified at least one Omicron variant case, including some that indicate community transmission. Among 43 cases with initial follow-up, one hospitalization and no deaths were reported. This report summarizes U.S. surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants, characteristics of the initial persons investigated with COVID-19 attributed to the Omicron variant and public health measures implemented to slow the spread of Omicron in the United States. Implementation of concurrent prevention strategies, including vaccination, masking, increasing ventilation, testing, quarantine, and isolation, are recommended to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including variants such as Omicron, and to protect against severe illness and death from COVID-19.

      The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan (Hubei province of China) has given rise to a pandemic spread of virus, more than 240 million incidences and a death toll larger than 5 million people. COVID-19 has set off large efforts in research, therapy and patient care, as well as public and private debates in every imaginable form. A number of scientists used the publication platforms provided by the Federation of the European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) to present their research data, reviews, opinions and other contributions relating to COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, I highlight the recent COVID-19 papers which have been published and collected in a Virtual Issue in FEBS Letters, and discuss their implications towards understanding the molecular, biochemical and cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccine development and antiviral discovery strategies.

      COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and then pandemic. Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3'-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections present with increased disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in diabetic patients compared with their nondiabetic counterparts. Diabetes/hyperglycemia-triggered endothelial dysfunction and hyperactive inflammatory and immune responses are correlated to twofold to threefold higher intensive care hospitalizations and more than twice the mortality among diabetic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. While comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension worsen the prognosis of diabetic COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 infections are also associated with new-onset diabetes, severe metabolic complications, and increased thrombotic events in the backdrop of aberrant endothelial function. While several antidiabetic medications are used to manage blood glucose levels, we discuss the multifaceted ability of metformin to control blood glucose levels and possibly attenuate endothelial dysfunction, inhibit viral entry and infection, and modify inflammatory and immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infections. These actions make metformin a viable candidate drug to be considered for repurposing and gaining ground against the SARS-CoV-2-induced tsunami in diabetic COVID-19 patients.

      Every day additional confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection are being reported across the globe. In the Netherlands more than 50 cases of probable reinfections have been identified. With more than 500 thousand people in the Netherlands who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up till now this number does seems to be quite low. Still, important questions have to be asked. How do we define reinfection and how do these reinfections compare to other (corona) viruses? What is the immunological significance? What is the duration of protective immunity? And what does Covid-19 reinfections mean for the prevention and development of a vaccine? The described cases of re-infections do teach us that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should also be considered for people with a documented Covid-19 infection in the past and that general precautions, such as the use of face masks and social distancing, still apply to those with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The review aims to consolidate research findings on the molecular mechanisms and virulence and pathogenicity characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and their relevance to four typical stages in the development of acute viral infection. These four stages are invasion; primary blockade of antiviral innate immunity; engagement of the virus's protection mechanisms against the factors of adaptive immunity; and acute, long-term complications of COVID-19. The invasion stage entails the recognition of the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 target cell receptors, namely, the main receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2), its coreceptors, and potential alternative receptors. The presence of a diverse repertoire of receptors allows SARS-CoV-2 to infect various types of cells, including those not expressing ACE2. During the second stage, the majority of the polyfunctional structural, non-structural, and extra proteins SARS-CoV-2 synthesizes in infected cells are involved in the primary blockage of antiviral innate immunity. A high degree of redundancy and systemic action characterizing these pathogenic factors allows SARS-CoV-2 to overcome antiviral mechanisms at the initial stages of invasion. The third stage includes passive and active protection of the virus from factors of adaptive immunity, overcoming of the barrier function at the focus of inflammation, and generalization of SARS-CoV-2 in the body. The fourth stage is associated with the deployment of variants of acute and long-term complications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2's ability to induce autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways of tissue invasion and development of both immunosuppressive and hyperergic mechanisms of systemic inflammation is critical at this stage of infection.

      The high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), and our limited understanding of the biology of the novel coronavirus, as well as the lack of an effective treatment for COVID-19, have created a global pandemic. Those most likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19 are adults, especially the elderly and those who are already weak or sick. At present, a specific drug for treatment of COVID-19 has not been developed. This, combined with the typical coexistence of a variety of chronic diseases in elderly patients, makes treatment challenging at present. In addition, for elderly patients, COVID-19 isolation measures during the epidemic can easily lead to psychological problems. Thus, how to manage elderly patients has become a focus of social attention in the current circumstances. This article reviews the effects of COVID-19 and makes management suggestions for elderly patients during this epidemic period. In addition to the elderly, critically ill people are also highly susceptible to this novel coronavirus. For elderly COVID-19 patients, antiviral therapy, immune regulation, and even auxiliary respiratory therapy can be given after a comprehensive evaluation of the disease. With the approval and use of COVID-19 vaccines, it is reasonable to expect that we can conquer SARS-CoV-2.

      Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines demonstrated high efficacy in clinical trials (1), they were not 100% efficacious. Thus, some infections postvaccination are expected. Limited data are available on effectiveness in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and against emerging variants. The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and a local health department investigated a COVID-19 outbreak in a SNF that occurred after all residents and health care personnel (HCP) had been offered vaccination. Among 83 residents and 116 HCP, 75 (90.4%) and 61 (52.6%), respectively, received 2 vaccine doses. Twenty-six residents and 20 HCP received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including 18 residents and four HCP who had received their second vaccine dose >14 days before the outbreak began. An R.1 lineage variant was detected with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although the R.1 variant has multiple spike protein mutations, vaccinated residents and HCP were 87% less likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 compared with those who were unvaccinated. Vaccination of SNF populations, including HCP, is critical to reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 introduction, transmission, and severe outcomes in SNFs. An ongoing focus on infection prevention and control practices is also essential.

      The year 2020 will be carved in the history books-with the proliferation of COVID-19 over the globe and with frontline health workers and basic scientists worldwide diligently fighting to alleviate life-threatening symptoms and curb the spread of the disease. Behind the shocking prevalence of death are countless families who lost loved ones. To these families and to humanity as a whole, the tallies are not irrelevant digits, but a motivation to develop effective strategies to save lives. However, at the onset of the pandemic, not many therapeutic choices were available besides supportive oxygen, anti-inflammatory dexamethasone, and antiviral remdesivir. Low-dose radiation (LDR), at a much lower dosage than applied in cancer treatment, re-emerged after a 75-year silence in its use in unresolved pneumonia, as a scientific interest with surprising effects in soothing the cytokine storm and other symptoms in severe COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the epidemiology, symptoms, immunological alterations, mutations, pharmaceuticals, and vaccine development of COVID-19, summarizing the history of X-ray irradiation in non-COVID diseases (especially pneumonia) and the currently registered clinical trials that apply LDR in treating COVID-19 patients. We discuss concerns, advantages, and disadvantages of LDR treatment and potential avenues that may provide empirical evidence supporting its potential use in defending against the pandemic.

      In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel variant of coronavirus has emerged from Wuhan in China and has created havoc impulses across the world with a larger number of fatalities. At the same time, studies are on roll to discover potent vaccine against it or repurposing of approved drugs which are widely adopted are under trial to eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 pandemic. Reports have also shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 disease who can transmit the disease to others too. However, the first line defense of the viral attack is body's strong and well-coordinated immune response producing excessive inflammatory innate reaction, thus impaired adaptive host immune defense which lead to death upon the malfunctioning. Considerable works are going on to establish the relation between immune parameters and viral replication that, might alter both the innate and adaptive immune system of COVID-19 patient by up riding a massive cytokines and chemokines secretion. This review mainly gives an account on how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with our immune system and how does our immune system responds to it, along with that drugs which are being used or can be used in fighting COVID-19 disease. The curative therapies as treatment for it have also been addressed in the perspective of adaptive immunity of the patients.

      COVID-19 is a novel viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beta-coronavirus. Epidemiological status changes dynamically as the pandemy is far from ending. Several complications of presented virus may be similar to those observed in other viral infections. Despite lacking data, the heart involvement may be comparable to cardiac complications observed previously in those with SARS as well as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In COVID-19 we observe elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides, troponins, myoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin, which is likely the result of myocardial injury. The possible mechanisms of cardiovascular injury include direct toxicity through the viral invasion of cardiac myocytes, ACE-2 receptor-mediated CV (cardiac and endothelial) injury, microvascular dysfunction and thrombosis and cytokine release syndrome (mainly IL-6 mediated). Cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are focal or global myocardial inflammation, necrosis, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and arrhythmia.

      Without modern medical management and vaccines, the severity of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might approach the magnitude of 1894-plague (12 million deaths) and 1918-A(H1N1) influenza (50 million deaths) pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed.

          Purpose of review:
        
      
      COVID-19 has put the in-vitro-diagnostic community under an unprecedented spotlight, with a global requirement for accurate SARS-CoV-2 tests. This review will outline technological responses to this need and the analytical considerations required for their translation to routine use.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic solutions directly detect the virus or measure host-derived surrogate markers of infection. With pressure upon supply chains for the 'traditional' molecular approaches, a wide variety of analytical tools spanning the molecular, serology, imaging and chemistry space are being developed, including high throughput solutions and simplified near-patient formats.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The unique genetic nature of SARS-CoV-2 means high analytical specificity is achievable by most diagnostic formats. However, clinical sensitivity assessment is complicated by wide discrepancies in analytical range and challenges associated with standardising these differences. When coupled with the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported precise metrics of test performance must be questioned. The response to SARS-CoV-2 has delivered considerable diagnostic innovation, but for a technology to be maximised, it must be demonstrably reproducible and fit for purpose. If novel diagnostic solutions for SARS-CoV-2 are to succeed, equally innovative mechanisms are needed to ensure widespread clinical and surveillance application, enabling agreed standards and metrics to ensure comparability.

      The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the focused application of resources and scientific expertise toward the goal of developing investigational vaccines to prevent COVID-19. The highly collaborative global efforts by private industry, governments and non-governmental organizations have resulted in a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates moving to Phase III trials in a period of only months since the start of the pandemic. In this review, we provide an overview of the preclinical and clinical data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in Phase III clinical trials and in few cases authorized for emergency use. We further discuss relevant vaccine platforms and provide a discussion of SARS-CoV-2 antigens that may be targeted to increase the breadth and durability of vaccine responses.

      The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an unprecedented global health crisis. However, therapeutic options for treatment are still very limited. The development of drugs that target vital proteins in the viral life cycle is a feasible approach for treating COVID-19. Belonging to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae with the largest RNA genome, SARS-CoV-2 encodes a total of 29 proteins. These non-structural, structural and accessory proteins participate in entry into host cells, genome replication and transcription, and viral assembly and release. SARS-CoV-2 proteins can individually perform essential physiological roles, be components of the viral replication machinery or interact with numerous host cellular factors. In this Review, we delineate the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 from the whole viral particle to the individual viral proteins and discuss their functions as well as their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions.

      The world continues to contend with successive waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fueled by the emergence of viral variants. At the same time, persistent, prolonged and often debilitating sequelae are increasingly recognized in convalescent individuals, named 'post-COVID-19 syndrome' or 'long-haul COVID'. Clinical symptomatology includes fatigue, malaise, dyspnea, defects in memory and concentration and a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes as the major manifestations, and several organ systems can be involved. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood at present. This Review details organ-specific sequelae of post-COVID-19 syndromes and examines the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms available so far, elaborating on persistent inflammation, induced autoimmunity and putative viral reservoirs. Finally, we propose diagnostic strategies to better understand this heterogeneous disorder that continues to afflict millions of people worldwide.

      While significant insights have been gained concerning COVID-19, superspreading of coronaviruses remains a mystery. The vast majority of cases have been linked to a relatively small portion of infected individuals. Yet, the genetic sequence of the virus, severity of disease, and underlying host parameters, such as age, sex, and health conditions, are not clearly driving the superspreading phenomenon. In this commentary we discuss what is known and what is not known about coronavirus superspreader transmission and explore whether characteristics of the virion, the donor, or the environment contribute to this phenomenon.

      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rapidly became a global health challenge, leading to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are both unique and complex. Omics-scale studies are emerging rapidly and offer a tremendous potential to unravel the puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, as well as moving forward with diagnostics, potential drug targets, risk stratification, therapeutic responses, vaccine development and therapeutic innovation. This review summarizes various aspects of understanding multiomics integration-based molecular characterizations of COVID-19, which to date include the integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics, lipidomics, immunomics and metabolomics to explore virus targets and developing suitable therapeutic solutions through systems biology tools. Furthermore, this review also covers an abridgment of omics investigations related to disease pathogenesis and virulence, the role of host genetic variation and a broad array of immune and inflammatory phenotypes contributing to understanding COVID-19 traits. Insights into this review, which combines existing strategies and multiomics integration profiling, may help further advance our knowledge of COVID-19.

      The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs a fast recognition of effective drugs to save lives. In the COVID-19 situation, finding targets for drug repurposing can be an effective way to present new fast treatments. We have designed a two-step solution to address this approach. In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug. The obtained candidate proteins sets approve 16 drugs out of 18 in the Covid-Drug, 273 drugs out of 328 in the Clinical-Drug, and a large number of drugs in the All-Drug. In the second step, we study COVID-19 associated proteins sets and recognize proteins that are essential to disease pathology. This analysis is performed using DAVID to show and compare essential proteins that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities. Our results for shared proteins show significant enrichment for cardiovascular-related, hypertension, diabetes type 2, kidney-related and lung-related diseases.

      Currently, there are no treatment options available for the deadly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a process of identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs and it is considered as a very effective strategy for drug discovery as it involves less time and cost to find a therapeutic agent in comparison to the de novo drug discovery process. The present review will focus on the repurposing efficacy of the currently used drugs against COVID-19 and their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and their future perspective. Relevant articles with experimental studies conducted in-silico, in-vitro, in-vivo, clinical trials in humans, case reports, and news archives were selected for the review. Number of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and interferons have shown inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV2 in-vitro as well as in clinical conditions. These drugs either act through virus-related targets such as RNA genome, polypeptide packing and uptake pathways or target host-related pathways involving angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors and inflammatory pathways. Using the basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of drugs as well as using computational tools, many drugs are currently in pipeline to be repurposed. In the current scenario, repositioning of the drugs could be considered the new avenue for the treatment of COVID-19.

      In late December 2019, a new kind of Coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was officially identified in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), and it has infected millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious Coronavirus, which has led to an outbreak of acute respiratory tract infection called ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19), resulting in mild to severe respiratory infections in humans. The design of appropriate therapeutic approaches is dependent on the understanding of molecular and cellular pathways of Coronavirus infections. In this study, we summarized the characteristic features of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we considered the recent information regarding COVID-19 molecular immune pathogenesis, diagnosis, and potential treatment, which may provide novel perspectives and therapeutic goals in combating SARS-CoV-2.

      Diagnostic tools play significant roles in the fight against COVID-19 and other pandemics. Existing tests, such as RT-qPCR, have limitations including long assay time, low throughput, inadequate sensitivity, and suboptimal portability. Emerging biosensing technologies hold the promise to develop tests that are rapid, highly sensitive, and suitable for point-of-care testing, which could significantly facilitate the testing of COVID-19. Despite that, practical applications of such biosensors in pandemics have yet to be achieved. In this review, we consolidate the newly developed diagnostic tools for COVID-19 using emerging biosensing technologies and discuss their application promise. In particular, we present nucleic acid tests and antibody tests of COVID-19 based on both conventional and emerging biosensing methods. We then provide perspectives on the existing challenges and potential solutions.

          Background and aims:
        
      
      Reinfection is gradually being recognised after symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. We try to elucidate various explanations behind COVID-19 reinfection and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Reinfection', 'Vaccines' and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in March 2021 and first half of April 2021 during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiology, risk factors and trends of reinfection were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A multitude of factors have been associated with rising incidence of COVID-19 reinfection in India and across the world. Emergence of 'Variants of Concern (VOC)', pandemic fatigue and disregard of infection prevention strategies appear to be the most obvious reasons.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      COVID-19 reinfection is an emerging concern amongst the worldwide population with newer mutant strains demonstrating increasing transmissibility and responsible for continuing waves of the pandemic. COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB), improvised vaccines and enhanced vaccination drives are necessary to mitigate global threat.

          Summary:
        
      
      A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit the spread of the virus. Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options.

      Occurrence and recurrence of COVID-19 cases have been observed globally. The complex relationship of host-pathogen and the environment plays a vital role in understanding the widespread recurrence of the SARS-CoV-2 among humans. Though the pathobiology of the disease is not completely understood, it is well established that COVID-19 poses a greater threat to individuals with co-morbidities and a weakened immune system. The article deals with the notion of innate immunity, natural selection, and the survival of the fittest during the COVID-19 outbreak. The article also attempts to introduce the concept of ""lifestyle and cultural immunity"" that needs to be addressed and incorporated at an early stage of childhood to boost up the human immune system. The communication further discusses the role of vaccination and micro-organisms pre-existing in the environment which are required to enhance the immunity of an individual.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified as a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei province, central China, in December 2019, and is responsible for the 2019-to-present pandemic. According to the most recent data released by the World Health Organization, more than 200 million people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 so far, and more than 4 million people died worldwide. Although our knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is constantly growing, data on COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients are still limited. The aim of the present systematic review is to describe clinical picture, disease severity, proposed treatment regimen, and response to vaccination in patients with different types and severity of immunosuppression.

          Introduction:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have been proposed as potential treatments. Azithromycin exhibits both properties and therefore may play a role.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of azithromycin in viral infections, with emphasis on COVID-19. A literature search of PUBMED was conducted on May 30th and updated on July 28th.
    


          Expert opinion:
        
      
      Azithromycin presents in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and could act in different points of the viral cycle. Its immunomodulatory properties include the ability to downregulate cytokine production, maintain epithelial cell integrity or prevent lung fibrosis. Azithromycin use was associated with a reduction in mortality and ventilation days in other viral infections. These properties could be beneficial throughout the COVID-19. However, the evidence of its use is scarce and of low quality. Azithromycin has been assessed in retrospective observational studies mainly in combination with hydroxychloroquine, which has shown to provide no benefit. This macrolide presents a well-known safety profile. Upcoming clinical trials will determine the role of azithromycin in the COVID-19 (including the stage of the disease where it offers the greatest benefits and the effect of its combination with other drugs).

      The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent coronaviruses, which has infected humans, and caused the disease COVID-19. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 enters human hosts majorly via the respiratory tract, affecting the lungs first. In few critical cases, the infection progresses to failure of the respiratory system known as acute respiratory distress syndrome acute respiratory distress syndrome may be further associated with multi-organ failure and vasoplegic shock. Currently, the treatment of COVID-19 involves use of antiviral and anti-cytokine drugs. However, both the drugs have low efficacy because they cannot inhibit the production of free radicals and cytokines at the same time. Recently, some researchers have reported the use of methylene blue (MB) in COVID-19 management. MB has been used since a long time as a therapeutic agent, and has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of other diseases. The additional advantage of MB is its low cost. MB is a safe drug when used in the dose of < 2 mg/kg. In this review, the applicability of MB in COVID-19 and its mechanistic aspects have been explored and compiled. The clinical studies have been explained in great detail. Thus, the potential of MB in the management of COVID-19 has been examined.

          Objective:
        
      
      Reports that the over-the-counter histamine H2 receptor antagonist famotidine could help treat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) appeared from April 2020. We, therefore, examined reports on interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and histamine receptor antagonists.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was performed by 19 September 2020, and updated on 28 October 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar using (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (histamine antagonist OR famotidine OR cimetidine). ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and (famotidine or histamine).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Famotidine may be a useful addition in COVID-19 treatment, but the results from prospective randomized trials are as yet awaited. Bioinformatics/drug repurposing studies indicated that, among several medicines, H1 and H2 receptor antagonists may interact with key viral enzymes. However, in vitro studies have to date failed to show a direct inhibition of famotidine on SARS-CoV-2 replication.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Clinical research into the potential benefits of H2 receptor antagonists in managing COVID-19 inflammation began from a simple observation and now is being tested in multi-centre clinical trials. The positive effects of famotidine may be due to H2 receptor-mediated immunomodulatory actions on mast cell histamine-cytokine cross-talk, rather than a direct action on SARS-CoV-2.

      The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread all over the world rapidly and caused a global pandemic. To prevent the virus from spreading to more individuals, it is of great importance to identify and isolate infected individuals through testing. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide. However, performing RT-qPCR is limited to centralized laboratories because of the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment and skilled personnel. Further, it can sometimes give false negative or uncertain results. Recently, new methods have been developed for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis using CRISPR-Cas systems. These methods present rapid and cost-effective diagnostic platforms that provide high sensitivity and specificity without the need for complex instrumentation. Using the CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection methods, it is possible to increase the number of daily tests in existing laboratories, reduce false negative or uncertain result rates obtained with RT-qPCR, and perform testing in resource-limited settings or at points of need where performing RT-qPCR is not feasible. Here, we briefly describe the RT-qPCR method, and discuss its limitations in meeting the current diagnostic needs. We explain how the unique properties of various CRISPR-associated enzymes are utilized for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis. Then, we highlight the important features of CRISPR-based diagnostic methods developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Finally, we examine the advantages and limitations of these methods, and discuss how they can contribute to improving the efficiency of the current testing systems for combating SARS-CoV-2.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic which has induced unprecedented ramifications, severely affecting our society due to the long incubation time, unpredictably high prevalence and lack of effective vaccines. One of the interesting notions is that there is an association between COVID-19 and cancer. Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality rate when exposed to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution to minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the new viral strains. However, there are still limitations to be considered, including the efficacy of COVID vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, possible interactions between the vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only to eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a successful vaccine platform is required through the implementation of nanotechnology which can also enable scalable manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of COVID-19 with clinical perspectives, highlighting the association between COVID-19 and cancer, followed by a vaccine development for this association using nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for the COVID-19 vaccine formulation options. This study will contribute to paving the way towards the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially for the immunocompromised individuals.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an extremely pathogenic virus belonging to the family of Coronaviridae. First identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 after an epidemiological investigation of an emerging cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology, SARS-CoV-2 was declared the cause of a pandemic on March 11 by the World Health Organization (WHO), pointing to the over 118000 cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in over 110 countries. Despite the promising results of drug repositioning studies in the treatment of COVID-19, the evidence of their safety and efficacy remains inconclusive. Cell based therapy has been proven safe and possibly effective in treating multiple lung injuries and diseases, but its potential use in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been yet elucidated. Our aim in this review is to provide an overview of the immunomodulatory effect and the regenerative capacity of stem cells and their secretome in the treatment of many diseases including lung injuries. Those findings may contribute to a better understanding of the potential of stem cell therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential use in order to find a solution for this healthcare crisis.

      The treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a challenge. The efficacy of several drugs has been evaluated and variability in drug response has been observed. Pharmacogenetics could explain this variation and improve patients' outcomes with this complex disease; nevertheless, several disease-related issues must be carefully reviewed in the pharmacogenetic study of COVID-19 treatment. We aimed to describe the pharmacogenetic variants reported for drugs used for COVID-19 treatment (remdesivir, oseltamivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and dexamethasone). In addition, other factors relevant to the design of pharmacogenetic studies were mentioned. Variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, CY2D6, ABCB1, ABCC2, and SLCO1B1, among other variants, could be included in pharmacogenetic studies of COVID-19 treatment. Besides, nongenetic factors such as drug-drug interactions and inflammation should be considered in the search for personalized therapy of COVID-19.

      In December 2019, twenty-seven pneumonia patients with unknown causes originated in South China seafood market in Wuhan. The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas.

      Diagnostics, vaccines, and drugs are indispensable tools and control measures employed to overcome infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Diagnostic tools based on RT-PCR were developed early in the COVID-19 pandemic and were urgently required for quarantine (testing, tracing and isolation). Vaccines such as mRNA vaccines and virus-vectored vaccines were also successfully developed using new platform technologies within one year after identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the causative agent of COVID-19. Drug development has been conducted in various ways including drug repurposing, convalescent plasma therapy, and monoclonal antibody development.

      To date, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) has spread to almost every region of the world, infecting millions and resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. Although it was predicted that Africa would suffer a massive loss of life due to this pandemic, the number of COVID-19 cases has been relatively low across the continent. Researchers have speculated that several factors may be responsible for this outcome in Africa, including the extensive experience that countries have with infectious diseases and the young median age of their populations. However, it is still important for African countries to adopt aggressive and bold approaches against COVID-19, in case the nature of the pandemic changes. This short review will summarize the status of the outbreak in Africa and propose possible reasons for current trends, as well as discuss interventions aimed at preventing a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the future.

      COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged as the deadliest outbreak that has now become a serious health issue to mankind. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine storm are crucial factors that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leads to the dysregulation of the innate immune system. The cytokine storm attracts many inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the lung tissues and ultimately cause immune damage. In addition to the dysregulation of the immune system, dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to the downregulation of ACE2 is also associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Both the mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with cytokine storm that promotes vascular hyperpermeability, vascular edema leading to hypercoagulation and hence multiorgan damage. As of now, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19, but scientists have purposed several treatment options including cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, immunomodulators, plasma therapy, etc. In this article, we have provided the detailed mechanism of occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm and its connection with the pre-existing inflammatory conditions. Possible treatment options to cope up with the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are also discussed.

      The peculiar features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are challenging the current biological knowledge. Early in Feb, 2020, we suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may possess neuroinvasive potential similar to that of many other coronaviruses. Since then, a variety of neurological manifestations have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was supported in some patients with neuroimaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid tests. To date, at least 27 autopsy studies on the brains of COVID-19 patients can be retrieved through PubMed/MEDLINE, among which neuropathological alterations were observed in the brainstem in 78 of 134 examined patients, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and viral proteins were detected in the brainstem in 16/49 (32.7%) and 18/71 (25.3%) cases, respectively. To shed some light on the peculiar respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 patients, this review assessed the existing evidence about the neurogenic mechanism underlying the respiratory failure induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acknowledging the neurological involvement has important guiding significance for the prevention, treatment, and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is a new enveloped virus that belongs to the Beta coronavirus genus. As a major health crisis, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over a million people around the world. There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been used in clinical practice. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and discusses the clinical value of blood transfusion-related technologies used in COVID-19 treatment.

      The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that emerged from Wuhan, China, and has spread all around the world, affecting 216 countries or territories with 21,732,472 people infected and 770,866 deaths globally (as per WHO COVID-19 updates of August 18, 2020). Continuous efforts are being made to repurpose the existing drugs and develop vaccines for combating this infection. Despite, to date, no certified antiviral treatment or vaccine exists. Although, few candidates have displayed their efficacy in in vitro studies and are being repurposed for COVID- 19 treatment. This article summarizes synthetic and semi-synthetic compounds displaying potent activity in clinical uses or studies on COVID-19 and also focuses on the mode of action of drugs being repositioned against COVID-19.

      Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in diverse outcomes. The symptoms appear to be more severe in males older than 65 and people with underlying health conditions; approximately one in five individuals could be at risk worldwide. The virus's sequence was rapidly established days after the first cases were reported and identified an RNA virus from the Coronaviridae family closely related to a Betacoronavirus virus found in bats in China. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the only ones to cause severe diseases. Lessons from these two previous outbreaks guided the identification of critical therapeutic targets such as the spike viral proteins promoting the virus's cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of multiple types of eukaryotic cells. Although several therapeutic agents are currently evaluated, none seems to provide a clear path for a cure. Also, various types of vaccines are developed in record time to address the urgency of efficient SARS-CoV-2 prevention. Currently, 58 vaccines are evaluated in clinical trials, including 11 in phase III, and 3 of them reported efficacy above 90 %. The results so far from the clinical trials suggest the availability of multiple effective vaccines within months.

      Urgent treatments, in any modality, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infections are desired by society in general, by health professionals, by Estate-leaders and, mainly, by the scientific community, because one thing is certain amidst the numerous uncertainties regarding COVID-19: knowledge is the means to discover or to produce an effective treatment against this global disease. Scientists from several areas in the world are still committed to this mission, as shown by the accelerated scientific production in the first half of 2020 with over 25,000 published articles related to the new coronavirus. Three great lines of publications related to COVID-19 were identified for building this article: The first refers to knowledge production concerning the virus and pathophysiology of COVID-19; the second regards efforts to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at a speed without precedent in the history of science; the third comprehends the attempts to find a marketed drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 by drug repurposing. In this review, the drugs that have been repurposed so far are grouped according to their chemical class. Their structures will be presented to provide better understanding of their structural similarities and possible correlations with mechanisms of actions. This can help identifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 promising therapeutic agents.

      With the emergence of COVID-19 extensive research began to identify medications, candidate compounds and other therapeutic approaches. The complex virology of COVID-19 may provide multiple potential target points for antiviral therapy, and vaccines; extensive global research is underway to exploit these potential opportunities. The complex pathophysiology, pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, and immune mediated effects such as cytokine storm, make medical management more challenging than many viral illnesses. Non medication based interventions including hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), aggressive dialysis, and other interventions, all with various degrees of clinical success, and will be discussed in this section. Several antivirals approved for other clinical indications were studied for repurposing against COVID-19, which we highlight, again with varying results. In addition to therapeutics, concern was raised over potential risks associated with ACE inhibitors and ARB use, which is presented. Often the timing of the medication determined its clinical benefit as will be discussed with dexamethasone and other medications. As such, this Therapeutics Review will present prominent and/or promising medications and therapeutic approaches with the caveats that 1. To date, none are FDA approved beyond emergency use authorization (EUA), and 2. Although a comprehensive look at various classes of interventions, it is by no means a complete list of every compound trialed against COVID-19. Recognizing the knowledge basis upon which we treat COVID-19 patients, develop therapeutics, and vaccines continues to evolve as new information is presented, every effort nevertheless has been made to provide as timely information as possible. It is hoped that the information shared can help guide the clinician in terms of potential options to treat this complex group of patients.

      As winter is approaching us, the possibility of respiratory tract infection is rising in the current scenario due to the lack of Covid-19 prophylaxis. So no one could be safe until everyone is safe. Researchers are looking for the vaccine to remove the need for social distancing, mask-wearing, and social gathering worldwide. We cannot say about the vaccine's effectiveness if the vaccine is available. Several drugs are being tested to save people's life from the pandemic; azithromycin is one of them. This work is a review article with the updated findings of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19. The option of azithromycin regarding COVID-19 is justified by its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-fibrotic effects and their pharmacokinetic properties, leading to effective concentrations in the target tissue. Azithromycin tends to be an effective candidate for SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition that blocks the initial stage of the viral life cycle. Clinical trials at a preliminary scale and final stage show the significant results of azithromycin in supportive care therapy. Azithromycin was an early candidate for the medication of Covid-19 with or without hydroxychloroquine. It is exercised mainly as an outpatient antibiotic in COVID-19. In summing up, any primary anti-viral and antibiotic treatment is not the only possibility of fighting COVID-19 pharmacologically. It will be an injustice to those who require broader spectrum antibiotics if we do not use azithromycin. So significant research priority is needed to determine whether azithromycin is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.

      Numerous reviews have summarized the epidemiology, pathophysiology and the various therapeutic aspects of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but a practical guide on ""how to treat whom with what and when"" based on an understanding of the immunological background of the disease stages remains missing. This review attempts to combine the current knowledge about the immunopathology of COVID-19 with published evidence of available and emerging treatment options. We recognize that the information about COVID-19 and its treatment is rapidly changing, but hope that this guide offers those on the frontline of this pandemic an understanding of the host response in COVID-19 patients and supports their ongoing efforts to select the best treatments tailored to their patient's clinical status.

      Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has changed our lives. Elderly and those with comorbidities represent the vast majority of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 symptoms, including acute respiratory disease syndrome and cardiac dysfunction. Despite a huge effort of the scientific community, improved treatment modalities limiting the severity and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are still required. Here, we compare the effectiveness of virus- and patients-centred strategies to reduce COVID-19 mortality. We also discuss the therapeutic options that might further reduce death rates associated with the disease in the future. Unexpectedly, extensive review of the literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 viral load seems to be associated neither with the severity of symptoms nor with mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This may explain why, so far, virus-centred strategies using antivirals aiming to inhibit the viral replicative machinery have failed to reduce COVID-19 mortality in patients with respiratory failure. By contrast, anti-inflammatory treatments without antiviral capacities but centred on patients, such as dexamethasone or Tocilizumab, reduce COVID-19 mortality. Finally, since the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and inhibits its function, we explore the different treatment options focussing on rebalancing the renin-angiotensin system. This new therapeutic strategy could hopefully further reduce the severity of respiratory failure and limit COVID-19 mortality in elderly patients.

      The COVID-19 pandemic has catastrophically impacted the world. Before the success in vaccination, this virus shows no sign of stop spreading. Nearly all the countries have implemented stringent approaches to slow down the transmission of the virus, but the virus still caused over 2 million deaths and the number is increasing. Therefore, preventing the virus spreading is still necessary to protect most people, especially the ones with pre-conditions. Mainland China has successfully eradicated the COVID-19 virus infection in Wuhan in 2020. After that, several small-scale outbreaks occurred in many cities in China, but none of these COVID-19 virus infections caused the widespread. In this review, we would like to give a detailed presentation of the approaches that were implemented by the China government to suppress the virus spreading by considering the unique characteristics of this virus and the paths of the virus transmission. Both the pros and cons of these strategies will also be analyzed. The experiences and lessons learned during the virus-fighting in China, expectedly, will be a useful source of reference for other regions in overcoming the threat caused by the COVID-19 virus.

      COVID-19 is a global emergency with over 10 million cases and over 500, 000 deaths worldwide. The SARS CoV-2 is a RNA virus belonging to the family coronaviridae. It has high infectivity. The manifestations of the disease range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and ARDS. The CT scan of lung shows consolidation and ""Ground Glass Opacities"". The persons with other comorbidities are considered to be at a higher rate of acquiring the infection. Asthma and other allergies have not been identified as major risk factors for COVID-19 as the number of asthmatic patients having COVID-19 is not high enough for it to be considered so. The occurrence of COVID-19 in COPD patients can be related with smoking. The ACE-2 expression in such patients was considerably high. The relation between COVID-19 and Tuberculosis can also be reflected in terms of the stigma associated with diagnosis and treatment of such diseases in some communities, eventually increasing the chances of people's reluctance to seek medical help. Cancer patients are usually more susceptible to infections. Lung cancer is no different. Additionally, lung cancer also has strong association with smoking further increasing the risk. The risk of getting infection and its severity is high for autoimmune disorders as well as fungal infections. Currently there is no definite treatment of COVID-19. However, some of the currently used modalities are hydroxychloroquine and antiviral drugs.

      A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to infect more than 100 million people globally, with mortality reaching nearly 3 million as of March 2021. The symptoms vary widely, from the absence of any symptoms to death. The severity of COVID-19 relates to hyperinflammatory conditions with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to multiple-organ failure and death. Innate immunity plays an important role in the early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and regulates the pathogenesis and its clinical outcomes. The most severe cases of COVID-19 present with increased innate immune cell infiltration in the lung, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood serum that are associated with disease severity. Here we review the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the recent reports and discuss the potential roles of innate immune cells and their mediators in pathogenesis that dictate the outcome of the disease. Understanding the roles of innate immune responses at the initial stages of infection may provide early windows into treatment and clues for vaccine development.

      CoVID-19 is a multi-symptomatic disease which has made a global impact due to its ability to spread rapidly, and its relatively high mortality rate. Beyond the heroic efforts to develop vaccines, which we do not discuss herein, the response of scientists and clinicians to this complex problem has reflected the need to detect CoVID-19 rapidly, to diagnose patients likely to show adverse symptoms, and to treat severe and critical CoVID-19. Here we aim to encapsulate these varied and sometimes conflicting approaches and the resulting data in terms of chemistry and biology. In the process we highlight emerging concepts, and potential future applications that may arise out of this immense effort.

          Conclusions:
        
      
      It was observed that use of proper precautionary measures like wearing a mask and regular hand sanitization helped in prevention from COVID-19 infection even after having close contact with confirmed cases. Such facts/observation will help in sensitizing the public about COVID-19 and eliminate panic in the society.

      Innate immunity impairment led to disruption in cascade of signaling pathways upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, diminish interferons, depleted natural killer cells and activate reactive oxygen species production. These conditions severely affected body's ability to fight against infectious diseases and also plays a pivotal role in disease progression. Here, in emphasis is on nutritional immunity for regulating effective innate immune response for combating against infectious diseases like novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19). Drawing from discoveries on in-vitro experiments, animal models and human trials, tea polyphenols, micronutrients, and vitamins has the potential to modulate and enhance innate immune response. This article provides a comprehensive review on tea (Camellia sinensis L) infusion (a hot water extract of dried processed tea leaves prepared from young shoots of tea plant) as an innate immunity modulator. Tea infusion is rich in polyphenols; epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theaflavin (TF), major green and black tea polyphenols, respectively. Studies showed their immunomodulatory competence. Tea infusions are also rich in alkaloids; caffeine and its intermediates, theophylline and theobromine, which have anti-inflammatory properties. Tea plant being an acidophilic perennial crop can accumulate different micronutrients, viz., copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) from growing medium, i.e., from soil, which led to their considerable presence in tea infusion. Micronutrients are integral part of innate immune response. Overall, this review presents tea infusion as an important source of nutritional immunity which can enhance innate immune response in order to mitigate the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.

      Assembly and publication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome in January 2020 enabled the immediate development of tests to detect the new virus. This began the largest global testing programme in history, in which hundreds of millions of individuals have been tested to date. The unprecedented scale of testing has driven innovation in the strategies, technologies and concepts that govern testing in public health. This Review describes the changing role of testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the use of genomic surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 transmission around the world, the use of contact tracing to contain disease outbreaks and testing for the presence of the virus circulating in the environment. Despite these efforts, widespread community transmission has become entrenched in many countries and has required the testing of populations to identify and isolate infected individuals, many of whom are asymptomatic. The diagnostic and epidemiological principles that underpin such population-scale testing are also considered, as are the high-throughput and point-of-care technologies that make testing feasible on a massive scale.

      COVID-19 is a new contagious disease caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is a disease that has reached every continent in the world; it has overloaded the medical system worldwide and it has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Currently there is no definite treatment for COVID-19. We realize that host immunity is a critical factor in the outcome of coronavirus 2 infection. Here, however, we review the pathophysiology of the disease with a focus on searching for what we can do to combat this new disease. From this, we find that coronavirus is sensitive to heat. We have thus focused on this area of vulnerability of the virus. The emphasis of this hypothesis is on the action of body heat-internal (fever) and external (heat treatment)-in activating the immune system and its antiviral activities, and specifically related to the coronavirus. We hypothesize from this review that heat treatments has the potential to prevent COVID-19 and to decrease the severity of mild and moderate cases of Coronavirus. We propose heat treatments for this uncontrolled worldwide coronavirus pandemic while studies are being done to test the effectiveness of heat treatments in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

      Increased transmissibility of the pandemic severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been noted to occur at lower ambient temperatures. This is seemingly related to a better replication of most respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, at lower-than-core body temperatures (i.e., 33 C vs 37 C). Also, intrinsic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 make it a heat-susceptible pathogen. Thermotherapy has successfully been used to combat viral infections in plants which could otherwise result in great economic losses; 90% of viruses causing infections in plants are positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (+ssRNA) viruses, a characteristic shared by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is possible to envision the use of heat-based interventions (thermotherapy or mild-temperature hyperthermia) in patients with COVID-19 for which moderate cycles (every 8-12 h) of mild-temperature hyperthermia (1-2 h) have been proposed. However, there are potential safety and mechanistic concerns which could limit the use of thermotherapy only to patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to prevent disease progression rather than to treat patients who have already progressed to severe-to-critical COVID-19. Here, we review the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 which make it a heat-susceptible virus, potential host mechanisms which could be enhanced at higher temperatures to aid viral clearance, and how thermotherapy could be investigated as a modality of treatment in patients with COVID-19 while taking into consideration potential risks.

      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID-19 pandemic has been declared as a priority disease. Some patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of multiple organ failure and death. The published articles on COVID-19 infection were reviewed. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not completely established. Person-to-person transmission via droplets, probable aerosols, or close contact is considered as the main mode of transmission. With increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2, valuable clinical indicators or treatments should be further identified and summarized. CT scanning plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients or those with initially negative RT-PCR results. No specific antiviral therapy is recommended, except the main supportive treatments, and effective measures should be taken into consideration to protect important organs and prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe infection.

      While the vaccination is now available to many countries and will slowly dissipate to others, effective therapeutics for COVID-19 is still illusive. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to researchers, scientists, and clinicians and affected the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a multitude of existing anti-viral, antibiotic, antimalarial, and anticancer drugs have been tested, and some have shown potency in the treatment and management of COVID-19, albeit others failed to leave any positive impact and a few also became controversial as they showed mixed clinical outcomes. In the present article, we have brought together some of the candidate therapeutic drugs being repurposed or used in the clinical trials and discussed their clinical efficacy and safety for COVID-19.

      COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is mild to moderate in the majority of previously healthy individuals, but can cause life-threatening disease or persistent debilitating symptoms in some cases. The most important determinant of disease severity is age, with individuals over 65 years having the greatest risk of requiring intensive care, and men are more susceptible than women. In contrast to other respiratory viral infections, young children seem to be less severely affected. It is now clear that mild to severe acute infection is not the only outcome of COVID-19, and long-lasting symptoms are also possible. In contrast to severe acute COVID-19, such 'long COVID' is seemingly more likely in women than in men. Also, postinfectious hyperinflammatory disease has been described as an additional outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here I discuss our current understanding of the immunological determinants of COVID-19 disease presentation and severity and relate this to known immune-system differences between young and old people and between men and women, and other factors associated with different disease presentations and severity.

          Background:
        
      
      Although molecular tests are considered the reference standard for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics, serological and immunological tests may be useful in specific settings.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This review summarizes the underlying principles and performance of COVID-19 serological and immunological testing.
    


          Sources:
        
      
      Selected peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19 related serology and immunology published between December 2019 and March 2021.
    


          Content:
        
      
      Serological tests are highly specific but heterogeneous in their sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19. For certain indications, including delayed disease presentations, serological tests can have added value. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a recent or past COVID-19 infection. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) antibody tests have the advantages of being easy and fast to perform, but many have a low sensitivity in acute settings. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs) have higher sensitivities. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity is also essential for successful host defences against viruses. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays can be used to measure T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in never exposed patients suggests the possibility of cellular immunity induced by other circulating coronaviruses. T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Serological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind COVID-19. Combining molecular diagnostics with serological tests may optimize the detection of COVID-19. As not all infected patients will develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, assessment of cellular immunity may provide complementary information on whether a patient has been previously infected with COVID-19. More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants.

          Introduction and objective:
        
      
      The course of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 may be aggravated by bioaerosols containing other viruses, bacteria, and fungi, occurring mainly in the occupational environment. Hence, the diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 should address such a possibility in the anamnesis, treatment and final recommendations for avoiding of adverse exposure.
    


          Abbreviated description of the state of knowledge:
        
      
      As SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the respiratory system and the severe manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, diagnostics should include the following clinical and laboratory examinations: chest X-ray; high resolution computed tomography (HRCT); pulmonary function tests; arterial-blood gas test; genetic tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, in the future with the use of highly specific and sensitive nano-based biosensors; tests for the presence of specific immunity against the antigens of microorganisms causing other infectious or allergic pulmonary diseases (in the case of anamnestic indications). Because an universally accepted treatment for COVID-19 does not exist, the hitherto prescribed antiviral and immune-modulating drugs should be used be with caution. In many cases, a better alternative could be a safe supportive therapy, such as supplementation of the diet with probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and microelements.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The most important preventive measures against COVID-19 should include: vaccination; the use of filter or surgical masks; disinfection and sterilization; maintaining of well-functioning ventilation and air conditioning systems; reduction of the community air pollution which has been identified as an important factor increasing the COVID-19 severity. In the choice of preventive measures, the above should be considered for their potential efficacy against other bioaerosols as potential disease-aggravating agents.

      Since December 2019, humanity has faced an important global threat. Many studies have been published on the origin, structure, and mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the treatment of its disease. The priority of scientists all over the world has been to direct their time to research this subject. In this review, we highlight chemical studies and therapeutic approaches to overcome COVID-19 with seven different sections. These sections are the structure and mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, immunotherapy and vaccine, computer-aided drug design, repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19, synthesis of new molecular structures against COVID-19, food safety/security and functional food components, and potential natural products against COVID-19. In this work, we aimed to screen all the newly synthesized compounds, repurposing chemicals covering antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiparasitic, anticancer, antipsychotic, and antihistamine compounds against COVID-19. We also highlight computer-aided approaches to develop an anti-COVID-19 molecule. We explain that some phytochemicals and dietary supplements have been identified as antiviral bioproducts, which have almost been successfully tested against COVID-19. In addition, we present immunotherapy types, targets, immunotherapy and inflammation/mutations of the virus, immune response, and vaccine issues.

      When the novel coronavirus was described in late 2019, it could not have been imagined that within a year, more than 100 vaccine candidates would be in preclinical development and several would be in clinical trials and even approved for use. The scale of the COVID-19 outbreak pushed the scientific community, working in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, public health bodies, policymakers, funders and governments, to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at record-breaking speed. As well as driving major amendments to the usual timeframe for bringing a vaccine to fruition, the pandemic has accelerated the development of next-generation technologies for vaccinology, giving rise to two frontrunner RNA vaccines. Although none of the critical safety and efficacy steps have been skipped within the compressed schedules, and the technologies underpinning the novel vaccines have been refined by scientists over many years, a significant proportion of the global population is sceptical of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and wary of potential risks. In this interview-based article, we give an overview of how the vaccines were developed and how they work to generate a robust immune response against COVID-19, as well as addressing common questions relating to safety and efficacy.

      The pandemic of Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that produces corona virus disease (COVID-19) has challenged the entire mankind by rapidly spreading globally in 210 countries affecting over 25 million people and about 1 million deaths worldwide. It continues to spread, afflicting the health system globally. So far there is no remedy for the ailment and the available antiviral regimens have been unsatisfactory for the clinical outcomes and the mode of treatment has been mainly supportive for the prevention of COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality. From the time immortal the traditional plant-based ethno-medicines have provided the leads for the treatment of infectious diseases. Phytopharmaceuticals have provided potential and less toxic antiviral drugs as compared to conventional modern therapeutics which are associated with severe toxicities. The ethnopharmacological knowledge about plants has provided food supplements and nutraceuticals as a promise for prevention and treatment of the current pandemic. In this review article, we have attempted to comprehend the information about the edible medicinal plant materials with potential antiviral activity specifically against RNA virus which additionally possess property to improve immunity along with external and internal respiration and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties for the prevention and treatment of the disease. This will open an arena for the development of novel nutraceutical herbal formulations as an alternative therapy that can be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious threat to global public health and social and economic development. Various vaccine platforms have been developed rapidly and unprecedentedly, and at least 16 vaccines receive emergency use authorization (EUA). However, the causative pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has continued to evolve and mutate, emerging lots of viral variants. Several variants have successfully become the predominant strains and spread all over the world because of their ability to evade the pre-existing immunity obtained after previous infections with prototype strain or immunizations. Here, we summarized the prevalence and biological structure of these variants and the efficacy of currently used vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 variants to provide guidance on how to design vaccines more rationally against the variants.

      The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic infection in March 2020. As of December 2020, two COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but there are no effective drugs to treat COVID-19, and pandemic mitigation efforts like physical distancing have had acute social and economic consequences. In this perspective, we discuss how the proteomic research community can leverage technologies and expertise to address the pandemic by investigating four key areas of study in SARS-CoV-2 biology. Specifically, we discuss how (1) mass spectrometry-based structural techniques can overcome limitations and complement traditional structural approaches to inform the dynamic structure of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, complexes, and virions; (2) virus-host protein-protein interaction mapping can identify the cellular machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 replication; (3) global protein abundance and post-translational modification profiling can characterize signaling pathways that are rewired during infection; and (4) proteomic technologies can aid in biomarker identification, diagnostics, and drug development in order to monitor COVID-19 pathology and investigate treatment strategies. Systems-level high-throughput capabilities of proteomic technologies can yield important insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology that are urgently needed during the pandemic, and more broadly, can inform coronavirus virology and host biology.

      After the global outbreak of coronaviruses caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an outbreak due to these viruses occurred in December, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and led to a worldwide spread. Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious global health emergency and spread from a person to another who has the virus. But the scope of an intermediate host is not known. Population at higher risk includes individuals in higher age group (>60 years) or with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and weaker immune system. Many unknown and underestimate risk factors could be responsible for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. These risk factors should be appropriately identified, addressed and necessary actions should be taken to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. Bhopal gas tragedy was one of the world's worst industrial chemical leak disaster. The survivors of this incident still suffer from the various complications such as increased rate of cancers, chronic illness like tuberculosis, respiratory diseases, birth defects, nerve injury, growth retardations, gynecological illness and many more. The survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 related adverse outcome. One of the possible explanations can be long term effect of methyl isocyanate (MIC). MIC exposure can lead to possible toxic effect on genetic, epigenetic and non-genetic factors. In this review, we aim to establish the scientific basis for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients who are also victims of Bhopal gas tragedy.

          Background:
        
      
      COVID-19 and its related anti-inflammatory treatment (steroids, immunomodulators) may induce the reactivation of latent bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections. According to our knowledge, no case of disseminated HHV-8-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS) after COVID-19 and its treatment has been described so far. Only one case of cutaneous KS concurrently with COVID-19 has been previously reported.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      We describe a case of disseminated KS in a 61-year-old immunocompetent Albanian man after hospitalization for COVID-19.
    


          Methods for literature research:
        
      
      We used PubMed as biomedical database for the literature research. We selected keyword combinations including ""Kaposi sarcoma,"" ""HHV-8,"" ""immunocompetent,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" and ""steroids."" No time or language limitation was set. Titles and abstracts of selected articles were systematically screened. Articles were included in the examination if they were published under free access through the digital library of the University of Brescia (Italy), and provided full text. Articles were excluded if the topic was beyond the aim of our study. Finally, we selected 15 articles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We describe a case of KS in COVID-19 patient and postulate that Interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity and steroid-induced immunodeficiency may play a major role in KS emergence. No published case of disseminated KS following COVID-19 in otherwise healthy individuals was found through the systematic literature review, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in areas with medium-high prevalence of HHV-8 infection. This observation might be explained by the role of individual genetic susceptibility factors.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and its treatment may lead to reactivation of several latent infections, including HHV-8 and its related clinical syndrome, Kaposi sarcoma.

      The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a promising tool for the rapid identification of COVID-19 patients. However, its performances were questioned. We evaluate the ID NOW COVID-19 in comparison to a reference RT-PCR using a collection of 48 fresh nasopharyngeal swabs sampled on universal transport media (UTM). Only 2 false negatives of the ID NOW COVID-19 were identified. They display PCR cycle threshold values of 37.5 and 39.2. The positive percent agreement and the negative percent agreement were 94.9% and 100%, respectively. The Kappa value was 0.88. The ID NOW COVID-19 combines high-speed and accurate processing. Using UTM, the ID NOW COVID-19 could be repeated in the case of invalid result. Further analyses, such as screening of genetic variants or genome sequencing, could also be performed with the same sample. As for all tests, the results should be interpreted according to clinical and epidemiological context.

      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Scientists and clinicians must acknowledge that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to attack the human body in multiple ways simultaneously and exploit any weaknesses of its host. A multipronged attack could potentially explain the severity and extensive variety of signs and symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the diverse tactics of this virus to infect the human body is both critical and incredibly complex. Although patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have primarily presented with pulmonary involvement, viral invasion, and injury to diverse end organs is also prevalent and well documented in these patients, but has been largely unheeded. Human organs known for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, heart, adrenals, brain, and testicles are examples of extra pulmonary tissues with confirmed invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Initial multiple organ involvement may present with vague signs and symptoms to alert health care professionals early in the course of COVID-19. Another example of an ongoing, yet neglected element of the syndromic features of COVID-19, are the reported findings of loss of smell, altered taste, ataxia, headache, dizziness, and loss of consciousness, which suggest a potential for neural involvement. In this review, we further deliberate on the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, the neurologic symptomology observed in COVID-19, the host-virus interaction, possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system, other neurologic considerations for patients with COVID-19, and a collective call to action.

      Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with increased transmissibility and occasionally reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibody activity induced by past ancestry virus infection or current COVID-19 vaccines. Nevertheless, COVID-19 vaccines have consistently demonstrated high efficacy and effectiveness against COVID-19 severe disease, hospitalisation and death, including disease caused by designated variants of concern. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccines are more heterogeneous in reducing the risk of infection and mild COVID19, and are modestly effective in interrupting virus transmission. Ongoing mutations of SARS-CoV-2 resulting in increased transmissibility and relative evasion of neutralising antibody activity induced by past virus infection or COVID-19 vaccines are likely. The duration of protection induced by COVID-19 vaccines is modelled to be relatively short in protecting against infection and mild COVID-19, but is likely to be 2 - 3 years against severe disease. Current experience from the UK and Israel demonstrates that even with high levels of COVID19 vaccine coverage (&gt;85% of the adult population), resurgences with new variants of concern remain a strong probability. Nevertheless, such resurgences are not mirrored by high rates of hospitalisation and death compared with what was experienced in relatively COVID-19 vaccine-naive populations. Even though COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to result in a herd immunity state, their ability to protect against severe COVID-19 and death could allow for a return to normalcy once a large enough proportion of the adult population in a country has been vaccinated.

      The causative agent of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 possesses RNA as a genetic material with 79% of the match with the bat SARS-CoV genome, which became epidemic in 2002. The SARS-CoV-2 peripheral Spike-Fc protein binds specifically to the ACE2 receptors present on bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes to downmodulates its expression which leads to severe acute respiratory failure. The disease is super infectious from human to human and the symptoms are similar to flu. The old aged and immunocompromised population are severely affected, and healthcare providers globally applied various strategies for treatment including the repurposing of drugs including antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral drugs.Herein, we described the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, immune responses, possible drug targets, vaccines under the trials and correlated the possibility of trained immunity induced by BCG vaccination over control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The countries with constraint BCG vaccination policy are struggling badly compared to countries with BCG vaccination policy. The BCG vaccination policy supports either lowering the total number of COVID-19 cases or the increasing recovery rate.

      We currently find ourselves in the midst of a global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the highly infectious novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we discuss aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathology and how these might interact with the circadian clock of the host. We further focus on the severe manifestation of the illness, leading to hospitalization in an intensive care unit. The most common severe complications of COVID-19 relate to clock-regulated human physiology. We speculate on how the pandemic might be used to gain insights on the circadian clock but, more importantly, on how knowledge of the circadian clock might be used to mitigate the disease expression and the clinical course of COVID-19.

      COVID-19, the human coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was reported for the first time in Wuhan, China in late 2019. COVID-19 has no preventive vaccine or proven standard pharmacological treatment, and consequently, the outbreak swiftly became a pandemic affecting more than 215 countries around the world. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, the only reliable diagnostics is a qPCR assay. Among other diagnostic tools, the CRISPR-Cas system is being investigated for rapid and specific diagnosis of COVID-19. The CRISPR-Cas-based methods diagnose the SARS-CoV-2 infections within an hour. Apart from its diagnostic ability, CRISPR-Cas system is also being assessed for antiviral therapy development; however, till date, no CRISPR-based therapy has been approved for human use. The Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells (PAC-MAN), which is Cas 13 based strategy, has been developed against coronavirus. Although this strategy has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic modality, it may face significant challenges for approval in human clinical trials. This review is focused on describing potential use and challenges of CRISPR-Cas based approaches for the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic technique and/or a possible therapeutic alternative for combating COVID-19. The assessment of potential risks associated with use of CRISPR will be important for future clinical advancements.

      The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly developed into a global pneumonia pandemic. Cardiovascular disease is the major comorbidity of COVID-19 patients and is closely related to the severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly or indirectly cause a series of cardiac complications, including acute myocardial injury and myocarditis, heart failure and cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and coagulation abnormalities. Intensive research on the SARS-CoV-2-associated cardiovascular complications is urgently needed to elucidate its exact mechanism and to identify potential drug targets, which will help to formulate effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review will summarize recent progress regarding the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system and describe the underlying mechanism of cardiovascular injury caused by SARS-CoV-2.

      SARS-CoV-2 virus has been identified as the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even when no standard treatment is available, antivirals such as remdesivir and other drugs such as chloroquine and ivermectin, which interfere with viral replication, have been assayed. Some strategies aimed at reducing immune mechanisms, such as the use of tocilizumab and natural antioxidants, have also been tested. The use of drugs related to the renin-angiotensin system has been controversial. Pathogenicity mechanisms, as well as controlled treatments, still have to be studied in detail in order to propose a viable therapeutic option that prevents the entry and replication of the virus or enhances the host immune system.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused more than 179 million infections and 3.8 million deaths worldwide. Throughout the past year, multiple vaccines have already been developed and used, while some others are in the process of being developed. However, the emergence of new mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 that have demonstrated immune-evading characteristics and an increase in infective capabilities leads to potential ineffectiveness of the vaccines against these variants. The purpose of this review article is to highlight the current understanding of the immunological mechanisms of the virus and vaccines, as well as to investigate some key variants and mutations of the virus driving the current pandemic and their impacts on current management guidelines. We also discussed new technologies being developed for the prevention, treatment, and detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we thoroughly reviewed and provided crucial information on SARS-CoV-2 virology, vaccines and drugs being used and developed for its prevention and treatment, as well as important variant strains.

      The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation. New discoveries about COVID-19 and its causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continue to deepen the understanding of this novel disease. As there is currently no COVID-19 specific treatment, isolation is the most effective method to prevent transmission. Moreover, development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine will be instrumental in reinstating pre-COVID-19 conditions. As of 31 July 2020, there are at least 139 vaccine candidates from around the globe in preclinical evaluation, with another 26 undergoing clinical evaluation. This paper aims to review the basics of COVID-19, including epidemiology, basic biology of SARS-CoV-2, and transmission.

      Currently, the world has been devastated by an unprecedented pandemic in this century. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been causing disorders, dysfunction and morphophysiological alterations in multiple organs as the disease evolves. There is a great scientific community effort to obtain a therapy capable of reaching the multiple affected organs in order to contribute for tissue repair and regeneration. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as potential candidates concerning the promotion of beneficial actions at different stages of COVID-19. MSCs are promising due to the observed therapeutic effects in respiratory preclinical models, as well as in cardiac, vascular, renal and nervous system models. Their immunomodulatory properties and secretion of paracrine mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and extracellular vesicles allow for long range tissue modulation and, particularly, blood-brain barrier crossing. This review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 impact to lungs, kidneys, heart, vasculature and central nervous system while discussing promising MSC's therapeutic mechanisms in each tissue. In addition, MSC's therapeutic effects in high-risk groups for COVID-19, such as obese, diabetic and hypertensive patients are also explored.

      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a lethal virus that was detected back on 31st December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, and since then this virus has been spreading across the globe causing a global outbreak and has left the world fighting against the virus. The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 and this was declared a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization on 11th March 2020. Several nations are trying to develop a vaccine that can save millions of lives. This review outlines the morphological features of the virus describing the outer and inner structures of the virus along with the entry mechanism of the virus into the host body and the infection process. Detailed reports of global outbreak along with preventive measures have also been included, with special emphasis on China, the United States of America, India, Italy, and South Korea.

      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly. To date, countries have relied on the prevention of the disease through isolation, quarantine, and clinical care of affected individuals. However, studies on the roles of asymptomatic and mildly infected subjects in disease transmission, use of antiviral drugs, and vaccination of the general population will be very important for mitigating the effects of the eventual return of this pandemic. Initial investigations are ongoing to evaluate antigenic structures of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. There also is a need to comprehensively compile the details of previous studies on SARS-related vaccines that can be extrapolated to identify potent vaccine targets for developing COVID-19 vaccines. This review aims to analyze previous studies, current status, and future possibilities for producing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

      Nowadays, Covid-19 is considered a serious health problem worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus that has sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). It is well known that the Corona Virus attacks mainly the respiratory system. Meanwhile, it has been established that coronavirus infection can extend beyond the respiratory system and unfortunately, can also affect our nervous system. Multiple neurological symptoms and signs had been documented during and post covid conditions. This virus gets access to the central nervous system (CNS) via the bloodstream leading to infect the endothelial lining cells. Also, it was reported that the virus can enter the peripheral nervous system via retrograde neuronal routes. The virus could be internalized in nerve synapses through endocytosis, transported retrogradely, and spread trans-synoptically to other brain regions. This minireview highlights the possible routes by which SARS-CoV-2 can invade the central nervous system (CNS) and its pathophysiology and manifestation.

      Infection of humans with SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a disease known colloquially as ""COVID-19"" with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia. Initial pathology is due to the virus binding to the ACE-2 protein on endothelial cells lining blood vessels and entering these cells in order to replicate. Viral replication causes oxidative stress due to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Many (~60%) of the infected people appear to have eliminated the virus from their body after 28 days and resume normal activity. However, a significant proportion (~40%) experience a variety of symptoms (loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue, cough, aching pain, ""brain fog,"" insomnia, shortness of breath, and tachycardia) after 12 weeks and are diagnosed with a syndrome named ""LONG COVID."" Longitudinal clinical studies in a group of subjects who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been compared to a non-infected matched group of subjects. A cohort of infected subjects can be identified by a battery of cytokine markers to have persistent, low level grade of inflammation and often self-report two or more troubling symptoms. There is no drug that will relieve their symptoms effectively. It is hypothesized that drugs that activate the intracellular transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) may increase the expression of enzymes to synthesize the intracellular antioxidant, glutathione that will quench free radicals causing oxidative stress. The hormone melatonin has been identified as an activator of NRF2 and a relatively safe chemical for most people to ingest chronically. Thus, it is an option for consideration of re-purposing studies in ""LONG COVID"" subjects experiencing insomnia, depression, fatigue, and ""brain fog"" but not tachycardia. Appropriately designed clinical trials are required to evaluate melatonin.

      The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a serious impact on global health. COVID-19 vaccines may be one of the most effective measure to end the pandemic. High infection risk and higher serious incident and mortality rates have been shown in cancer patients with COVID-19. Therefore, cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention. Until now, data of COVID-19 vaccination for cancer patients is lacking. We review the interim data of safety and immune-efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients based on the latest studies. Due to the complicated immune systems of cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, we proposed preliminary specific COVID-19 vaccination recommendations for cancer patients with different anticancer treatments and at different stages of the disease. Preventing COVID-19 with vaccinations for cancer patients is crucial, and we call for more large-scale clinical trials and real-world studies, for further COVID-19 vaccination recommendations development. .

In a short span of time, COVID-19 has sacked more than one million human lives and marked as a severe global pandemic, which is drastically accountable for the adverse effect directly to the human society, particularly the health care system and the economy. The unavailability of approved and effective drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 further created conditions more adverse and terrifying. To win the war against this pandemic within time there is a desperate need for the most adequate therapeutic treatment, which can be achieved by the collaborative research work among scientists worldwide. In continuation of our efforts to support the scientific community, a review has been presented which discusses the structure and the activity of numerous molecules exhibiting promising SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs inhibition activities. Furthermore, this review offers an overview of the structure, a plausible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, and crucial structural features substantial to inhibit the primary virus-based and host-based targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. We anticipate optimistically that this perspective will provide the reader and researcher's better understanding regarding COVID-19 and pave the path in the direction of COVID-19 drug discovery and development paradigm.

      Critical to viral infection are the multiple interactions between viral proteins and host-cell counterparts. The first such interaction is the recognition of viral envelope proteins by surface receptors that normally fulfil other physiological roles, a hijacking mechanism perfected over the course of evolution. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has successfully adopted this strategy using its spike glycoprotein to dock on the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The crystal structures of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins alone or in complex with their receptors or other ligands were recently solved at an unprecedented pace. This accomplishment is partly due to the increasing availability of data on other coronaviruses and ACE2 over the past 18 years. Likewise, other key intervening actors and mechanisms of viral infection were elucidated with the aid of biophysical approaches. An understanding of the various structurally important motifs of the interacting partners provides key mechanistic information for the development of structure-based designer drugs able to inhibit various steps of the infective cycle, including neutralizing antibodies, small organic drugs, and vaccines. This review analyzes current progress and the outlook for future structural studies.

      COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been prevalent worldwide for almost a year. In early 2000, there was an outbreak of SARS-CoV, and in early 2010, a similar dissemination of infection by MERS-CoV occurred. However, no clear explanation for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and a massive increase in the number of infections has yet been proposed. The best solution to overcome this pandemic is the development of suitable and effective vaccines and therapeutics. Fortunately, for SARS-CoV-2, the genome sequence and protein structure have been published in a short period, making research and development for prevention and treatment relatively easy. In addition, intranasal drug delivery has proven to be an effective method of administration for treating viral lung diseases. In recent years, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have been applied to intranasal drug delivery to overcome various limitations that occur during mucosal administration, and advances have been made to the stage where effective drug delivery is possible. This review describes the accumulated knowledge of the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and aims to help understand the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, it elucidates the achievements in developing COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics to date through existing approaches. Finally, the applicable nanotechnology approach is described in detail, and vaccines and therapeutic drugs developed based on nanomedicine, which are currently undergoing clinical trials, have presented the potential to become innovative alternatives for overcoming COVID-19.

          Objective:
        
      
      As a beta-coronavirus, Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused one of the most significant historical pandemics, as well as various health and medical challenges. Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness.

          Background:
        
      
      Gaining further insights into SARS-CoV-2 routes of infection and the underlying pathobiology of COVID-19 will support the design of rational treatments targeting the life cycle of the virus and/or the adverse effects (e.g., multi-organ collapse) that are triggered by COVID-19-mediated adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or other pathologies.
    


          Main body:
        
      
      COVID-19 is a two-phase disease being marked by (phase 1) increased virus transmission and infection rates due to the wide expression of the main infection-related ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L human genes in tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, as well as by (phase 2) host- and probably sex- and/or age-specific uncontrolled inflammatory immune responses which drive hyper-cytokinemia, aggressive inflammation and (due to broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2) collateral tissue damage and systemic failure likely because of imbalanced ACE/ANGII/AT1R and ACE2/ANG(1-7)/MASR axes signaling.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Here we discuss SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and a number of approaches aiming to suppress viral infection rates or propagation; increase virus antigen presentation in order to activate a robust and durable adaptive immune response from the host, and/or mitigate the ARDS-related ""cytokine storm"" and collateral tissue damage that triggers the severe life-threatening complications of COVID-19.

      In the global health emergency caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), efficient and specific therapies are urgently needed. Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop; they are as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and they have thus attracted much attention in the past few months. This article reviews seven existing antibodies for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 with 3D structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Five 3D antibody structures associated with the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are also evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared with those between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis, a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the 14 antibody-antigen complexes. The current COVID-19 antibody clinical trials, which are not limited to the S protein target, are also reviewed.

Introduction: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a major pandemic and continuously emerging due to unclear prognosis and unavailability of reliable detection tools. Older adults are more susceptible to COVID-19 than children showing mature Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), low concentration of immune targets, and comorbid conditions. Several detection platforms have been commercialized to date and more are in pipeline, however, the rate of false-positive results and rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is increasing. Additionally, physiological, and geographical variations of affected individuals are also calling for diagnostic methods optimization.Areas Covered: Extensive information related to the optimization and usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods based on sensitivity and specificity as definitive and feasible investigative tools is discussed. Moreover, an option of combining laboratory diagnostic methods to improve diagnostic strategies is also proposed and discussed in the comparative section of optimization studies.Expert Opinion: The review article explains the importance of optimization strategies for SARS-CoV-2 detection in children and older adults. There are advancements in COVID-19 detection including CRISPR-based, electrochemical, and optical-based sensing systems. However, the lack of sufficient studies on a comparative evaluation of standardized SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods among children and older adults, limit the authentication of commercialized kits.

          Objective:
        
      
      We sought to review the literature on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing in patients with COVID-19 for evidence of viral neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase between December 1, 2019 and November 18, 2020 to identify case reports or series of patients who had COVID-19 diagnosed based on positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serologic testing and had CSF testing due to a neurologic symptom.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 242 relevant documents which included 430 patients with COVID-19 who had acute neurological symptoms prompting CSF testing. Of those, 321 (75%) patients had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). Of 304 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, there were 17 (6%) whose test was positive, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). The majority (13/17, 76%) of these patients were admitted to the hospital because of neurological symptoms. Of 58 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 7 (12%) had positive antibodies with evidence of intrathecal synthesis, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the CNS. Of 132 patients who had oligoclonal bands evaluated, 3 (2%) had evidence of intrathecal antibody synthesis. Of 77 patients tested for autoimmune antibodies in the CSF, 4 (5%) had positive findings.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via PCR or evaluation for intrathecal antibody synthesis appears to be rare. Most neurological complications associated with SARS- CoV-2 are unlikely to be related to direct viral neuroinvasion.

      Emerging epidemic-prone diseases have introduced numerous health and economic challenges in recent years. Given current knowledge of COVID-19, herd immunity through vaccines alone is unlikely. In addition, vaccination of the global population is an ongoing challenge. Besides, the questions regarding the prevalence and the timing of immunization are still under investigation. Therefore, medical treatment remains essential in the management of COVID-19. Herein, recent advances from beginning observations of COVID-19 outbreak to an understanding of the essential factors contributing to the spread and transmission of COVID-19 and its treatment are reviewed. Furthermore, an in-depth discussion on the epidemiological aspects, clinical symptoms and most efficient medical treatment strategies to mitigate the mortality and spread rates of COVID-19 is presented.

      Currently, the world is in the seventh month of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, infections with novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are continuously rising with mounting numbers of deaths. International and local public health responses, almost in synchrony, imposed restrictions to minimize spread of the virus, overload of health system capacity, and deficit of personal protective equipment (PPE). Although in most cases the symptoms are mild or absent, SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to serious acute respiratory disease and multisystem failure. The research community responded to this new disease with a high level of transparency and data sharing; with the aim to better understand the origin, pathophysiology, epidemiology and clinical manifestations. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop vaccines for prevention, mitigation strategies, as well as potential therapeutics.The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the novel SARS CoV-2, including its pathophysiology and epidemiology, as well as, what is known about the potential impact of COVID-19 on reproduction, fertility care, pregnancy and neonatal outcome. This summary also evaluates the effects of this pandemic on reproductive care and research, from Canadian perspective, and discusses future implications.In summary, reported data on pregnant women is limited, suggesting that COVID-19 symptoms and severity of the disease during pregnancy are similar to those in non-pregnant women, with pregnancy outcomes closely related to severity of maternal disease. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 effects on gametes is limited. Human reproduction societies have issued guidelines for practice during COVID-19 pandemic that include implementation of mitigation practices and infection control protocols in fertility care units. In Canada, imposed restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic were successful in containing spread of the infection, allowing for eventual resumption of assisted reproductive treatments under new guidelines for practice. Canada dedicated funds to support COVID-19 research including a surveillance study to monitor outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy and assisted reproduction. Continuous evaluation of new evidence must be in place to carefully adjust recommendations on patient management during assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and in pregnancy.

      Old individuals are more susceptible to various infections due to immunological changes that occur during the aging process. These changes named collectively as ""immunosenescence"" include decreases in both the innate and adaptive immune responses in addition to the exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines. This scenario of immunological dysfunction and its relationship with disease development in older people has been widely studied, especially in infections that can be fatal, such as influenza and, more recently, COVID-19. In the current scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infection, many mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in old individuals have been proposed. To better understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in this group, aspects related to immunological senescence must be well elucidated. In this article, we discuss the main mechanisms involved in immunosenescence and their possible correlations with the susceptibility of individuals of advanced age to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the more severe conditions of the disease.

      The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic known as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), responsible for the death of more than 2 million people worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented threat on human lives and public safety. The aim of this review is to describe key aspects of the bio-pathology of the novel disease, and discuss aspects of its spread, as well as targeted protective strategies that can help shape the outcome of the present and future health crises. Greece is used as a model to inhibit SARS-COV-2 spread, since it is one of the countries with the lowest fatality rates among nations of the European Union (E.U.), following two consecutive waves of COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, niche research technological approaches and scientific recommendations that emerged during the COVID-19 era are discussed.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, is reported to increase the rate of mortality worldwide. COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory symptoms as well as blood coagulation in the vessels (thrombosis), heart attack and stroke. Given the requirement of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, here we discuss how the downregulation of ACE2 in the COVID-19 patients and virus-induced shift in ACE2 catalytic equilibrium, change the concentrations of substrates such as angiotensin II, apelin-13, dynorphin-13, and products such as angiotensin (1-7), angiotensin (1-9), apelin-12, dynorphin-12 in the human body. Substrates accumulation ultimately induces inflammation, angiogenesis, thrombosis, neuronal and tissue damage while diminished products lead to the loss of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic responses. In this review, we focus on the viral-induced imbalance between ACE2 substrates and products which exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Considering the roadmap, we propose multiple therapeutic strategies aiming to rebalance the products of ACE2 and to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease.

      The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has majorly contributed to massive and widespread mortality. Epidemiological data strongly indicates a sex-based disparity in COVID-19 clinical outcomes, with women having lower infection and hospitalisation rates, coupled with better prognosis and lesser mortality. This disparity may be explained by several mechanisms including differences in innate and adaptive immune responses, genetic factors, and an interplay between sex hormones and immune effectors, as well as gender-specific behaviour differences. These pathways, particularly the immunological divergence in response to viral infection, could potentially influence not only COVID-19 pathogenesis and disease course, but also the response to antiviral drugs and vaccines. Furthermore, factors that confer a protective advantage against COVID-19 may be exploited to develop therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

      Though the lungs are predominantly affected in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, extra-pulmonary manifestations can occur. Extra-pulmonary manifestations of the central and peripheral nervous system need to be recognised as they can strongly determine the outcome. This mini-review summarises and discusses previous and recent findings about neuro-COVID. The spectrum of central nervous system disease in COVID-19 patients is much broader than so far anticipated. Peripheral nerves and the skeletal muscle are less predominantly affected. In the vast majority of the cases, there is no direct attack of the virus towards vulnerable structures, which explains why various manifestations of the nervous system manifest favourably to immune suppression or immune modulation. Overall, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of CNS/PNS involvement in COVID-19 is wider than believed. All patients with COVID-19 should be investigated by the neurologist for primary or secondary involvement of the CNS/PNS in the infection. neuro-COVID responds favourably to immune suppressants or immune modulation.

          Background:
        
      
      The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world extraordinarily. This disease has a potential to cause a significantly severe course of disease leading to respiratory complications, multiple organ failure and possibly death. In the fight against this pandemic-causing disease, medical professionals around the world are searching for pharmacological agents that could treat and prevent disease progression and mortality. To speed the search of promising treatment options, already existing pharmacological agents are repurposed for the potential treatment of COVID-19 and tested in clinical trials. The aim of this literature review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of repurposed pharmacological agents for the treatment of COVID-19 at different pathophysiologic stages of the disease. For this literature review, online-databases PubMed and Google Scholar were utilised. Keywords ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""pathogenesis"", ""drug targets"", ""pharmacological treatment"", ""cytokine storm"", ""coagulopathy"" and individual drug names were used. Scientific articles, including reviews, clinical trials, and observational cohorts, were collected and analysed. Furthermore, these articles were examined for references to find more clinical trials testing for the potential treatment of COVID-19. In total, 97 references were used to conduct this research paper.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The most beneficial pharmacological agent for the treatment of COVID-19 are corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, for the treatment of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Other promising agents are remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring minimal supplemental oxygen therapy, and IL-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies in severe COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin demonstrate the least efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. The clinical benefits of the treatment of a COVID-19-specific coagulopathy with increased dosing of anticoagulation need further research and confirmation of randomised controlled trials.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The search for pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 has elicited great controversy. Whereas drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir have not shown proven benefit, the agents remdesivir and dexamethasone are recommended for clinical use for the treatment of COVID-19. Further randomised trials for other pharmacological treatment strategies are awaited.

          Background:
        
      
      The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a current pandemic of unprecedented scale. Although diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately applicable protocol.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, although this may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      As it uses the standard protocols, reagents, and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for coronavirus disease 2019 would allow expanding current screening capacities, thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.

      The calamity of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), COVID-19, is still a global human tragedy. To date, no specific antiviral drug or therapy has been able to break the widespread of SARS-CoV2. It has been generally believed that stimulating protective immunity via universal vaccination is the individual strategy to manage this pandemic. Achieving an effective COVID-19 vaccine requires attention to the immunological and non-immunological standpoints mentioned in this article. Here, we try to introduce the considerable immunological aspects, potential antigen targets, appropriate adjuvants as well as key points in the various stages of COVID-19 vaccine development. Also, the principal features of the preclinical and clinical studies of pioneering COVID-19 vaccine candidates were pointed out by reviewing the available information. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in the successful design of the COVID-19 vaccine and address the most fundamental strengths and weaknesses of common vaccine platforms.

      A novel strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has been recently identified as an infectious disease affecting the respiratory system of humans. This disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was identified in Chinese patients having severe pneumonia and flu-like symptoms. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads rapidly via droplet particles arising through sneezing and coughing action of an infected person. The reports of asymptomatic carriers changed the scenario of symptom based-diagnosis in COVID-19 and intensified the need for proper diagnosis of the majority of the population to combat the rapid transmission of virus. The diagnosis of positive cases is necessary to ensure prompt care to affected people and also to curb further spread of infection in the population. Collecting samples at the right time and from the exact anatomical site is crucial for proper molecular diagnosis. After the complete genome sequence was available, China formulated RT-PCR as a primary diagnostic procedure for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Many in-house and commercial diagnostic kits have been developed or are under development that have a potential to lower the burden of diagnosis on the primary diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR. Serological based diagnosis is another broad category of testing that can detect different serum antibodies like IgG, IgM, and IgA in an infected patient. PCR-based diagnostic procedures that are commonly used for pathogen detection need sophisticated machines and assistance of a technical expert. Despite their reliable accuracy, they are not cost-effective tests, which a common man can afford, so it becomes imperative to look for other diagnostic approaches, which could be cost effective, rapid, and sensitive with consistent accuracy. To make such diagnostics available to the common man, many techniques can be exploited among, which are Point of Care (POC), also known as bed side testing, which is developing as a portable and promising tool in pathogen diagnosis. Other lateral flow assay (LFA)-based techniques like SHERLOCK, CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR), and FNCAS9 editor-limited uniform detection assay (FELUDA), etc. have shown promising results in rapid detection of pathogens. Diagnosis holds a critical importance in the pandemic situation when there is no potential drug for the pathogen available in the market. This review sums up the different diagnostic approaches designed or proposed to combat the crisis of widespread diagnosis due to the sudden outbreak of a novel pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.

      The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic threat to global public health. It has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild to critical illness, the most serious of which is the complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infection appears mild in infants and children, however, in adults, it can lead to serious consequences. In this review, we highlighted the differences between the immune responses of the lung in children and adults, immune dysregulation and their possible role in clinical manifestations in COVID-19. There is a reduction in population of immunocompetent cells during aging and subsequently induced ineffective inflammation in the faces of some infections. Dysregulation in the immune system can lead to an unappropriated local and systemic immune responses and subsequently the rapid spread of the virus, leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Therefore, recognizing the differences in the immune responses of various hosts as well as to improve the immune system disorder should always be part of research and treatment protocols.

      With the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease, the research community is producing unprecedented efforts dedicated to better understand and mitigate the effects of the pandemic. In this context, we review the data integration efforts required for accessing and searching genome sequences and metadata of SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 disease, which have been deposited into the most important repositories of viral sequences. Organizations that were already present in the virus domain are now dedicating special interest to the emergence of COVID-19 pandemics, by emphasizing specific SARS-CoV2 data and services. At the same time, novel organizations and resources were born in this critical period to serve specifically the purposes of COVID-19 mitigation while setting the research ground for contrasting possible future pandemics. Accessibility and integration of viral sequence data, possibly in conjunction with the human host genotype and clinical data, are paramount to better understand the COVID-19 disease and mitigate its effects. Few examples of host-pathogen integrated datasets exist so far, but we expect them to grow together with the knowledge of COVID-19 disease; once such datasets will be available, useful integrative surveillance mechanisms can be put in place by observing how common variants distribute in time and space, relating them to the phenotypic impact evidenced in the literature.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious zoonotic pathogen that has exacted heavy public health, social and economic tolls. In February 2020, the World Health Organization acronymed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, for coronavirus disease 2019. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many cases of COVID-19 resolve quickly. However, the disease, which, like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. Infection with COVID-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. Moreover, because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself, such as pulmonary embolism, or its treatment, such as nausea and diarrhea, diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Potential COVID-19 rule out criteria, based on the Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism, another protean disease entity, are provided as a decision-making aid. This review summarizes the current understanding of the transmission, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathogenesis, rationale to treat the cancer or not, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with an emphasis on implications in cancer.

      The world at large is facing a new threat with the emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Though imperceptible by the naked eye, the medical, sociological and economical implications caused by this newly discovered virus have been and will continue to be a great impediment to our lives. This health threat has already caused over two million deaths worldwide in the span of a year and its mortality rate is projected to continue rising. In this review, the potential of algae in combating the spread of COVID-19 is investigated since algal compounds have been tested against viruses and algal anti-inflammatory compounds have the potential to treat the severe symptoms of COVID-19. The possible utilization of algae in producing value-added products such as serological test kits, vaccines, and supplements that would either mitigate or hinder the continued health risks caused by the virus is prominent. Many of the characteristics in algae can provide insights on the development of microalgae to fight against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses and contribute in manufacturing various green and high-value products.

      The global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought the world to a grinding halt. A major cause of concern is the respiratory distress associated mortality attributed to the cytokine storm. Despite myriad rapidly approved clinical trials with repurposed drugs, and time needed to develop a vaccine, accelerated search for repurposed therapeutics is still ongoing. In this review, we present Nitazoxanide a US-FDA approved antiprotozoal drug, as one such promising candidate. Nitazoxanide which is reported to exert broad-spectrum antiviral activity against various viral infections, revealed good in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture assays, suggesting potential for repurposing in COVID-19. Furthermore, nitazoxanide displays the potential to boost host innate immune responses and thereby tackle the life-threatening cytokine storm. Possibilities of improving lung, as well as multiple organ damage and providing value addition to COVID-19 patients with comorbidities, are other important facets of the drug. The review juxtaposes the role of nitazoxanide in fighting COVID-19 pathogenesis at multiple levels highlighting the great promise the drug exhibits. The in silico data and in vitro efficacy in cell lines confirms the promise of nitazoxanide. Several approved clinical trials world over further substantiate leveraging nitazoxanide for COVID-19 therapy.

      Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two other coronaviruses that caused disease epidemic breakouts in humans in the last 2 decades, namely, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The similarities have enabled the scientists to apply the basic scientific discoveries garnered from studying the structure and modus operandi of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to develop therapies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Targeted therapies including the use of antibodies to prevent virus entry, nucleotide analogues to prevent viral replication, and inhibitors of proteases to prevent virion formation, among others, are being tested for their clinical efficacy. Likewise, complete sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 and identification of its structural and nonstructural proteins have enabled development of RNA-, DNA-, and peptide-based vaccines as well attenuated viral vaccines to instigate the host-immune responses. The clinical impacts of the basic science discoveries are amply evident on the rapid pace of progress in developing specific antiviral therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The progress emphasizes the merit of discovering the fundamental scientific elements, regardless of whether or not they have apparent or immediate clinical applications.

      Little is known about the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. In a COVID-19 dedicated clinic, we followed-up for 4 months 25 children previously hospitalized for COVID-19, performing clinical, laboratory, and lung ultrasound evaluation. Mid-term sequelae were rarely observed in our COVID-19 children's cohort.

      The estimated smooth curve of the percentage of subjects positive to SARS-CoV-2 started decreasing in Italy at the beginning of January 2021, due to the government containment measures undertaken from Christmas until 7 January. Approximately two weeks after releasing the measures, the curve stopped to decrease and remained approximately constant for four weeks to increase again in the middle of February. This epidemic phase had a public health care impact since, from the beginning of the fourth week of February, the curve of the intensive care unit's occupancy started to grow. This wave of infection was characterized by the presence of new virus variants, with a higher than 80% dominance of the so-called ""English"" variant, since 15 April. School activities in Italy started at different times from 7 January until 8 February, depending on every region's decision. Our present data on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in different age groups in Italy are in agreement with literature reports showing that subjects older than 10 years are involved in virus transmission. More importantly, we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that also individuals of age 0-9 years can significantly contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

      Since December 2019, the world was encountered a new disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although SARS-CoV-2 initially causes lung damage, it also affects many other organs, including the kidneys, and on average, 5-23% of people with COVID-19 develop the symptoms of acute kidney injury (AKI), including elevated blood creatinine and urea, hematuria, proteinuria, and histopathological damages. The exact mechanism is unknown, but the researchers believe that SARS-CoV-2 directly and indirectly affects the kidneys. The direct pathway is by binding the virus to ACE2 receptor in the kidney, damage to cells, the renin-angiotensin system disturbances, activating coagulation pathways, and damaging the renal vascular endothelium. The initial evidence from studying the kidney tissue in postmortem patients is more in favor of the direct pathway. The indirect pathway is created by increased cytokines and cytokine storm, sepsis, circulatory disturbances, hypoxemia, as well as using the nephrotoxic drugs. Using renal tissue biopsy and autopsy in the patients with COVID-19, recent studies found evidence for a predominant indirect pathway in AKI induction by SARS-CoV-2. Besides, some studies showed that the degree of acute tubular injury (ATI) in autopsies from COVID-19 victims is milder compared to AKI degree. We review the mechanism of AKI induction and the renal side effects of the most common drugs used to treat COVID-19 after the overview of the latest findings on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.

      In this study, we performed genome-wide association analyses on SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify genetic mutations associated with pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Various potential covariates and confounding factors of COVID-19 severity, including patient age, gender and country, as well as virus phylogenetic relatedness were adjusted for. In total, 3021 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 generated from original clinical samples and whose patient status could be determined conclusively as either 'pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic' or 'symptomatic' were retrieved from the GISAID database. We found that the mutation 11 083G>T, located in the coding region of non-structural protein 6, is significantly associated with asymptomatic COVID-19. Patient age is positively correlated with symptomatic infection, while gender is not significantly correlated with the development of the disease. We also found that the effects of the mutation, patient age and gender do not vary significantly among countries, although each country appears to have varying baseline chances of COVID-19 symptom development.

      Since emerging coronaviruses have always become a human health concern globally especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and a novel coronavirus was introduced in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (called SARS-CoV-2), many researchers focused on its epidemics, virological and clinical features. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as Betacoronaviruses genus and Sarbecovirus subgenus (lineage B). The virus shows a great similarity with SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. In this study, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 virus phylogeny and evolution by using current virus and related sequences.

      COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection of zoonotic origin that is closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused an outbreak in 2003. Therefore, scientists named the new virus SARS-CoV-2. On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. At present, three vaccines have been approved or are being considered for approval by national regulatory agencies to immunize against COVID- 19. However, the vaccines do not remain widely available, and no specific treatment against the virus is available. The pathogenesis and proliferation pathways of SARS-CoV-2 are still not well known. Thus, in this article, the saponin glycyrrhizin is discussed as a new potential therapeutic agent of natural origin (licorice root, Glycyrrhiza glabra) for the potential treatment of COVID-19 infections.

      In the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, public health experts have emphasized testing, tracking infected people, and tracing their contacts as an effective strategy to reduce the spread of the virus. Several diagnostic methods are reported for detecting the coronavirus in clinical, research, and public health laboratories. Some tests detect the infection directly by detecting the viral RNA and other tests detect the infection indirectly by detecting the host antibodies. A diagnostic test during the pandemic should help make an appropriate clinical decision in a short period of time. Recently reported diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 have varying throughput, batching capacity, requirement of infrastructure setting, analytical performance, and turnaround times ranging from a few minutes to several hours. These factors should be considered while selecting a reliable and rapid diagnostic method to help make an appropriate decision and prompt public health interventions. This paper reviews recent SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods published in journals and reports released by regulatory agencies. We compared the analytical efficiency including limit of detection, sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. In addition, we also looked into ease of use, affordability, and availability of accessories. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the methods and provide our perspectives on priorities for future test development.

      New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are available to prevent the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. We compared the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines to prevent symptomatic and severe disease in the adult population and to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 among the elderly. Leading medical databases were searched until August 30, 2021. Published phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated efficacy of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic and sever COVID-19 in adults were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated the literature search results and independently extracted summary data. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) according to PRISMA-NMA 2015 to pool indirect comparisons between different vaccines regarding their relative efficacy. The primary outcomes were the efficacy of the vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 in adults (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021235364). Above 200,000 adult participants from eight phase 3 RCTs were included in NMA, of whom 52% received the intervention (active COVID-19 vaccine). While each of nine vaccines was tested in the unique clinical trial as compared to control, based on indirect comparison, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were ranked with the highest probability of efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 (P-scores 0.952 and 0.843, respectively), followed by Gam-COVID-Vac (P-score 0.782), NVX-CoV23730 (P-score 0.700), CoronaVac (P-score 0.570), BN02 (P-score 0.428), WIV04 (P-score 0.327), and Ad26.COV2.S (P-score 0.198). No statistically significant difference was seen in the ability of the vaccines to prevent symptomatic disease in the elderly population. No vaccine was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk for severe COVID-19 than other vaccines, although mRNA-1273 and Gam-COVID-Vac have the highest P-scores (0.899 and 0.816, respectively), indicating greater protection against severe disease than other vaccines. In our indirect comparison, the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, which use mRNA technology, were associated with the highest efficacy to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 compared to other vaccines. This finding may have importance when deciding which vaccine to use, together with other important factors as availability of the vaccines, costs, logistics, side effects, and patient acceptability.

      SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that can enter its hosts through the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is mainly expressed in cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophageal epithelium and enterocytes from the ileum-colon. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has varying clinical symptoms and presents differently in individuals, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to moderate clinical spectrum with mild pneumonia clinical features, and to a severe clinical presentation with dyspnea and hypoxia, leading to death due to respiratory or multi-organ failure. COVID-19 infection can also manifest themselves in the form of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. Severe complications of gastrointestinal COVID-19 infections include hemorrhage or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and severe inflammation, which can adversely affect the intestinal immune system, and therefore the systemic immune system of the host. Furthermore, COVID-19 has also shown to affect microbiota homeostasis in the digestive tract. To date, no clear explanation is available regarding the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection, fecal RNA detection, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to discuss the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the digestive tract, microbiota, and lung, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission in COVID-19.

      The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), identified in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on March, 2020. Since then, efforts have been gathered to describe its clinical course and to determine preventive measures and treatment strategies. Adults older than 65 years of age are more susceptible to serious clinical symptoms and present higher mortality rates. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a major receptor for some coronavirus infection, including SARS-COV-2, but is also a crucial determinant in anti-inflammation processes during the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) functioning - converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. The decline in ACE2 expression that occurs with aging has been associated to the higher morbidity and mortality rates in older adults. These observations highlight the importance of investigating the association between COVID-19 and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, i.e., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. A possible option to reduce the risk of COVID-19 is vitamin D supplementation, due to its anti-inflammatory and immune-system-modulating effects. It has also been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing progression of Parkinson and Alzheimer. The present study is a literature review of articles published on the theme COVID-19, Parkinson and Alzheimer's diseases, and the role played by vitamin D. PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were consulted. Results confirm neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory effects of COVID-19, aggravated in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients, and the important role of vitamin D as a possible therapeutic strategy. Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials and large population studies are still warranted.

      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly swept over the world, becoming one of the most devastating outbreaks in human history. Being the first pandemic in the post-genomic era, advancements in genomics contributed significantly to scientific understanding and public health response to COVID-19. Genomic technologies have been employed by researchers all over the world to better understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its origin, genomic diversity, and evolution. Worldwide genomic resources have greatly aided in the investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has ushered in a new era of genomic surveillance, wherein scientists are tracking the changes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in real-time at the international and national levels. Availability of genomic and proteomic information enables the rapid development of molecular diagnostics and therapeutics. The advent of high-throughput sequencing and genome editing technologies led to the development of modern vaccines. We briefly discuss the impact of genomics in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in this review.

      Since November 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused nearly 200 million infection and more than 4 million deaths globally (Updated information from the World Health Organization, as on 2nd Aug 2021). Within only one year into the pandemic, several vaccines were designed and reached approval for the immunization of the world population. The remarkable protective effects of the manufactured vaccines are demonstrated in countries with high vaccination rates, such as Israel and UK. However, limited production capacities, poor distribution infrastructures and political hesitations still hamper the availability of vaccines in many countries. In addition, due to the emergency of SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune escape properties towards the vaccines the global numbers of new infections as well as patients developing severe COVID-19, remains high. New studies reported that about 8% of infected individuals develop long term symptoms with strong personal restrictions on private as well as professional level, which contributes to the long socioeconomic problems caused by this pandemic. Until today, emergency use-approved treatment options for COVID-19 are limited to the antiviral Remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue targeting the viral polymerase, the glucocorticosteroide Dexamethasone as well as neutralizing antibodies. The therapeutic benefits of these treatments are under ongoing debate and clinical studies assessing the efficiency of these treatments are still underway. To identify new therapeutic treatments for COVID-19, now and by the post-pandemic era, diverse experimental approaches are under scientific evaluation in companies and scientific research teams all over the world. To accelerate clinical translation of promising candidates, repurposing approaches of known approved drugs are specifically fostered but also novel technologies are being developed and are under investigation. This review summarizes the recent developments from the lab bench as well as the clinical status of emerging therapeutic candidates and discusses possible therapeutic entry points for the treatment strategies with regard to the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19.

      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic to a severe clinical course. The host genetic background influence on the susceptibility and outcome of multiples infectious diseases has been previously reported. Herein, we aimed to describe relevant identified genetic variants and those potentially related to the inter-individual variability of COVID-19 susceptibility and/or severity considering the physiopathological pathway of the disease The HLA-A*25:01, -B*15:27, -B*46:01, -C*01:02, and -C*07:29 alleles have been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility; while HLA-A*02:02, -B*15:03, and -C*12:03 have been identified as low-risk alleles. Variants in cytokine genes such as IL1B, IL1R1, IL1RN, IL6, IL17A, FCGR2A, and TNF could be related to disease susceptibility and cytokine storm, and/or COVID-19 complications (e.g., venous thrombosis). Several variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 affecting the expression of the receptors related to COVID-19 have been associated with the disease susceptibility and risk factors. Finally, two GWAS have identified the loci 3p21.31 (LZTFL1, SLC6A20, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1) and 9q34.2 (ABO) with COVID-19 severity. Heterogeneous results in the association of genetic variants with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were observed. The mechanism of identified risk-genes and studies in different populations are still warranted.

      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has high transmissibility and could result in acute lung injury in a fraction of patients. By counterbalancing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the fusion receptor of the virus, plays a protective role against the development of complications of this viral infection. Vitamin D can induce the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and regulate the immune system through different mechanisms. Epidemiologic studies of the relationship between vitamin D and various respiratory infections were reviewed and, here, the postulated mechanisms and clinical data supporting the protective role of vitamin D against COVID-19-mediated complications are discussed.

      COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease-2019) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, known as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is a highly contagious disease that has already affected more than 220 countries globally, infecting more than 212 million people and resulting in the death of over 4.4 million people. This review aims to highlight the pertinent documentary evidence upon the adverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on several vital human organs. SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lung tissue by causing diffuse alveolar damage and may result in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell via cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Besides lungs, SARS-CoV-2 critically damage tissues in other vital human organs such as the heart, kidney, liver, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. The effect on the heart includes muscle dysfunction (acute or protracted heart failure), myocarditis, and cell necrosis. Within hepatic tissue, it alters serum aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. It contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI). Localized infection of the brain can lead to loss or attenuation of olfaction, muscular pain, headaches, encephalopathy, dizziness, dysgeusia, psychomotor disorders, and stroke; while the gastrointestinal symptoms include the disruption of the normal intestinal mucosa, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain. This review encompassed a topical streak of systemic malfunctions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the pandemic is still in progress, more studies will enrich our understanding and analysis of this disease.

Many Canadian research groups have expanded their research programs to include COVID-19. Over the past year, our knowledge of this novel disease has grown and has led to the initiation of a number of clinical vaccine and drug trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we review SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) and the natural history of COVID-19, including a timeline of disease progression after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We also review the pathophysiological effects of COVID-19 on the organ systems that have been implicated in the disease, including the lungs, upper respiratory tract, immune system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal organs, the liver, and the kidneys. Then we review general therapeutics strategies that are being applied and investigated for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19, including vaccines, antivirals, immune system enhancers, pulmonary supportive agents, immunosuppressants and (or) anti-inflammatories, and cardiovascular system regulators.

      An acute respiratory disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that surfaced in China in late 2019, continues to spread rapidly across the globe causing serious concerns. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is declared as a public health emergency worldwide by the World Health Organization (WHO). Increasing evidences have demonstrated human-to-human transmission that primarily affects the upper respiratory tract followed by lower respiratory tract damage leading to severe pneumonia. Based on the current status, the elderly population and people with prior co-morbidities are highly susceptible to serious health effects including cytokine up-regulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Currently, COVID-19 research is still in the preliminary stage necessitating rigorous studies. There is no specific drug or vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2 currently and only symptomatic treatment is being administered, but several antivirals are under active investigation. In this review, we have summarized the epidemiology, entry mechanism, immune response, and therapeutic implications, possible drug targets, their ongoing clinical trials, and put forward vital questions to offer new directions to the COVID-19 research.

      COVID-19 caused by SARS CoV2 (The novel corona virus) has already taken lives of many people across the globe even more than anyone could have imagined. This outbreak occurred in China and since then it is expanding its devastating effects by leaps and bounds. Initially it appeared to be an outbreak of pneumonia but soon it was found to be much more than that and the infectivity was found to be very high. This is the reason that it has taken whole globe in its trap and become a pandemic in such a short span of time. Death is occurring because it is a new virus and human body has no specific antibodies for it. Presently there is no approved vaccine so everyone is susceptible but people with co-morbidities appear to be in more risk and the best way for protection is social distancing and increasing one's natural immunity by taking healthy diet and exercise. When a person is infected the clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to severe ARDS, sudden onset of anosmia, headache, cough may be the initial symptoms. This review is focused on immunopathology and effect of COVID-19 on neurological disorders and also the neurological manifestations and the treatment.

      Three major outbreaks of the coronavirus, a zoonotic virus known to cause respiratory disease, have been reported since 2002, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the most recent 2019-nCoV, or more recently known as SARS-CoV-2. Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the nave human population. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe. Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and spreading through asymptomatic carriers, further suggesting a high global health threat. To this end, current up-to-date information on the coronavirus evolution and SARS-CoV-2 modes of transmission, detection techniques and current control and prevention strategies are summarized in this review.

      The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) marks the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to spill over into the human population. SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible with a broad tissue tropism that is likely perpetuating the pandemic. However, important questions remain regarding its transmissibility and pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize current SARS-CoV-2 research, with an emphasis on transmission, tissue tropism, viral pathogenesis, and immune antagonism. We further present advances in animal models that are important for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development, and therapeutic testing. When necessary, comparisons are made from studies with SARS to provide further perspectives on coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as draw inferences for future investigations.

      SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a global pandemic that began in March 2020 and is currently in progress. To date, COVID-19 has caused about 935,000 deaths in more than 200 countries. The respiratory system is most affected by injuries caused by COVID-19, but other organs may be involved, including the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2). ACE-2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in other organs, including the cardiovascular system. Several studies have found that a good percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 have cardiac lesions, including myocardial fibrosis, edema and pericarditis. Pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix caused by viral infection leads to myocardial fibrotic lesions. These fibrotic scars can cause cardiac dysfunction, reducing the ejection fraction caused by the presence of stiffened myocardial matrix, or cardiac arrhythmias that cause an alteration in the electrical conduction system of the heart. These cardiac dysfunctions can cause death. It is therefore essential to identify cardiac involvement early in order to act with appropriate therapeutic treatments. In this review, we describe what is known about cardiac injury from COVID-19, highlighting effective pharmacological therapeutic solutions to combat cardiac injury, particularly cardiac fibrosis, caused by COVID-19.

      Patients infected with novel coronavirus exhibit a wide range of symptoms from common cold to pneumonia. Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease.

      In December 2019, a new infectious disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attributed to the new virus named severe scute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected. The gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the viral identification in nasopharyngeal swab by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Few data on the role of imaging are available in the pediatric population. Similarly, considering that symptomatic therapy is adequate in most of the pediatric patients with COVID-19, few pediatric pharmacological studies are available. The main aim of this review is to describe and discuss the scientific literature on various imaging approaches and therapeutic management in children and adolescents affected by COVID-19. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are less severe in children than in adults and as a consequence the radiologic findings are less marked. If imaging is needed, chest radiography is the first imaging modality of choice in the presence of moderate-to-severe symptoms. Regarding therapy, acetaminophen or ibuprofen are appropriate for the vast majority of pediatric patients. Other drugs should be prescribed following an appropriate individualized approach. Due to the characteristics of COVID-19 in pediatric age, the importance of strengthening the network between hospital and territorial pediatrics for an appropriate diagnosis and therapeutic management represents a priority.

      SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged zoonotic virus, has resulted in unstoppable high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. However, due to a limited knowledge of the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it has been observed that the current COVID-19 therapy has led to some clinical repercussions. We discuss the adverse effects of drugs for COVID-19 primarily based on some clinical trials. As therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of therapy may vary due to different, genetic determinants, sex, age and the ethnic background of test subjects, hence biomarker-based personalized therapy could be more appropriate. We will share our thoughts on the current landscape of personalized therapy as a roadmap to fight against SARS-CoV-2 or another emerging pathogen.

          Background:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2, which majorly affects the lungs and respiratory tract is thought due to dysregulation of the immune system which causes an immense imbalance of the cytokines. However, till now no standard treatment has been developed in treating the disease. On the other hand, it becomes important to prevent the acute respiratory tract infection due to COVID-19 which is the most dangerous phase leading to increased mortality. Hence this systematic review has been framed by pooling the available data of the use of stem cells in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and ARDS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      6 literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Clinical trial registry of India) were searched for relevant studies till 10th August 2020 using keywords stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, cell therapy, SARS CoV-2, SARS Coronavirus, Coronavirus 2, COVID-19, nCoV-19, Novel Coronavirus, MERS CoV, ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The observations of this systematic review suggest capability of MSCs in reducing the systemic inflammation and protecting against SARS-CoV-2 as evidenced by the available clinical data.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      MSCs can overcome the clinical challenges currently faced by SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, specifically who are seriously ill and not responding to conventional therapies. Though the available clinical data is motivating, still predicting the therapeutic potential of MSCs will be too early in COVID-19. Hence, further studies in a larger cohort of patients becomes a prerequisite to validate their potential efficacy.

"This paper compares the long-term (1970-2002) rates of real growth in health spending per capita in the United States and a group of high-income countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Real health spending growth is decomposed into population aging, overall economic growth, and excess growth. Although rates of aging and overall economic growth were similar, annual excess growth was much higher in the United States (2.0 percent) versus the OECD countries studied (1.1 percent). That difference, which is of an economically important magnitude, suggests that country-specific institutional factors might contribute to long-term health spending trends.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.26.1.154,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17211024/,economics
"Model-based economic evaluations of new interventions have shown that user behaviour (uptake) is a critical driver of overall impact achieved. However, early economic evaluations, prior to introduction, often rely on assumed levels of uptake based on expert opinion or uptake of similar interventions. In addition to the likely uncertainty surrounding these uptake assumptions, they also do not allow for uptake to be a function of product, intervention, or user characteristics. This letter proposes using uptake projections from discrete choice experiments (DCE) to better parameterize uptake and substitution in cost-effectiveness models. A simple impact model is developed and illustrated using an example from the HIV prevention field in South Africa. Comparison between the conventional approach and the DCE-based approach shows that, in our example, DCE-based impact predictions varied by up to 50% from conventional estimates and provided far more nuanced projections. In the absence of observed uptake data and to model the effect of variations in intervention characteristics, DCE-based uptake predictions are likely to greatly improve models parameterizing uptake solely based on expert opinion. This is particularly important for global and national level decision making around introducing new and probably more expensive interventions, particularly where resources are most constrained.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3297,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26773825/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Decision-makers are increasingly requesting economic analyses on transportation-related interventions, but health is often excluded as a determinant of value. We assess the health-related economic impact of bicycle infrastructure investments in three Canadian cities (Victoria, Kelowna and Halifax), comparing a baseline reference year (2016) with the future infrastructure build-out (2020).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT; version 4.2) was used to quantify the economic value of health benefits associated with increased bicycling, using a 10-year time horizon. Outputs comprise premature deaths prevented, carbon emissions avoided, and a benefit:cost ratio. For 2016-2020, we derived cost estimates for bicycle infrastructure investments (including verification from city partners) and modelled three scenarios for changes in bicycling mode share: 'no change', 'moderate change' (a 2% increase), and 'major change' (a 5% increase). Further sensitivity analyses (32 per city) examined how robust the moderate scenario findings were to variation in parameter inputs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Planned bicycle infrastructure investments between 2016 and 2020 ranged from $28-69 million (CAD; in 2016 prices). The moderate scenario benefit:cost ratios were between 1.7:1 (Victoria) and 2.1:1 (Halifax), with the benefit estimate incorporating 9-18 premature deaths prevented and a reduction of 87-142 thousand tonnes of carbon over the 10-year time horizon. The major scenario benefit:cost ratios were between 3.9:1 (Victoria) and 4.9:1 (Halifax), with 19-43 premature deaths prevented and 209-349 thousand tonnes of carbon averted. Sensitivity analyses showed the ratio estimates to be sensitive to the time horizon, investment cost and value of a statistical life inputs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Within the assessment framework permitted by HEAT, the dollar value of health-related benefits exceeded the cost of planned infrastructure investments in bicycling in the three study cities. Depending on the decision problem, complementary analyses may be required to address broader questions relevant to decision makers in the public sector.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246419,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33556076/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To assess the economic burden of food allergy (FA) worldwide.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on the Wiley platform were searched to identify literature that assessed direct, out-of-pocket, and opportunity costs of FA. All databases were searched back to their inception, and no language or date limits were applied.
    


          Study selections:
        
      
      We included primary studies that examined direct medical, out-of-pocket, or opportunity costs and/or lost labor productivity in food allergic adults and/or children and their families.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eleven papers met our inclusion criteria, of which ed7 addressed direct medical, 7 addressed out-of-pocket, and 5 addressed opportunity costs. Estimates were based on data that reflected costs for a patient with FA (individual level) or costs for a household with a food allergic patient (household level). The mean individual-level direct medical costs ($2081) were much higher than the mean household-level costs ($806). The mean individual-level out-of-pocket ($1874) and opportunity ($1038) and opportunity cost were lower than the mean household-level out-of-pocket ($3339) and opportunity ($4881) costs. Household-level estimates of lost opportunity costs imposed the largest economic burden attributable to FA.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Most of the economic burden studies reviewed measured components of economic burden that are unique to individuals with FA but did so in noncomparable ways. Addressing cost burdens and measuring them using standardized instruments and methods will be critical to better understand the economic burden of FA globally.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2019.01.014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30703439/,economics

"In 2000 the World Health Organization launched the ""Bone and Joint Decade"" campaign in part to promote cost-effective treatments. This will impact the organization, delivery, and funding of health care as the population ages. However, it is well recognized that resources in health care are limited and it is essential the resources available are used to best effect. Thus, there has been greater emphasis in the orthopaedic literature on the use of economics. Still, there is little discussion of whether and how the results of these economic methods can be further used to aid resource allocation decisions. We discuss the suitability of economic methods for priority setting in orthopaedic surgery, arguing economic evaluation alone is not sufficient for addressing resource allocation decisions. We also describe an alternative approach to priority setting that has been steadily gaining prominence within health economics--program budgeting and marginal analysis--and use a working example from the United Kingdom National Health Service to illustrate its application within orthopaedic surgery.",https://doi.org/10.1097/blo.0b013e31803427b9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17290157/,economics
"The pressure for health-care systems to provide more resource-intensive health care and newer more costly therapies is significant, despite limited health-care budgets. As such, demonstration that a new therapy is effective is no longer sufficient to ensure that it is funded within publicly funded health-care systems. The impact of a therapy on health-care costs is also an important consideration for decision makers who must allocate scarce resources. The clinical benefits and costs of a new therapy can be estimated simultaneously using economic evaluation; the strengths and limitations of which are discussed herein. In addition, within this chapter, we discuss the important economic outcomes that can be collected within a clinical trial (alongside the clinical outcome data) enabling consideration of the impact of the therapy on overall resource use, thus enabling performance of an economic evaluation, if the therapy is shown to be effective.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1138-8_27,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33871861/,economics
"The introduction of market forces into the NHS has led to an operational divorce between health care providers and those who need health-care. Central to this change has been the widespread use of contracts. As a management problem, contract negotiation must incorporate consideration of full cost recovery to establish prices for hospital services sold and to ensure that available information is employed in assessing external services purchased. Ignoring the important issue of information availability in identifying relevant costs, it is the difficulty in specifying the cost of an episode of treatment, for example, that has led to contracts being negotiated in block form. Argues that this may be the only contract that can be effectively established. An important consequence of this is that the complexity of hospital services and requirements will work against a wider implementation of piecemeal managed competition and will form a natural barrier to market forces in the NHS.",https://doi.org/10.1108/02689239410059598,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10137558/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the economic burden of ill health in Guatemala, the characteristics of Guatemala's health system that potentially explain this burden, and to identify policies to help ameliorate it.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from the 2000 and 2006 Living Standard Measurement Surveys are used to assess levels of financial burden from ill health, along with information on health system characteristics of Guatemala and recent reform experiences of several middle- and low-income countries.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Despite some gains over the period from 2000 to 2006, there continues to be both a high level and inequitable distribution of financial burden associated with ill health in Guatemala. Low levels of insurance coverage, a heavy concentration of the uninsured among the less well off and rural populations, as well as their low levels of access to public services are important drivers of out of pocket spending on health. Households with older members also appear to be at increased risk for out of pocket payments.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      High levels of catastrophic health spending and poverty co-exist with significant economic inequality and poverty in Guatemala. With health system features and a large informal sector similar to many other developing countries, recent international experience can provide useful lessons to help Guatemala devise innovative financing and payment mechanisms to address these concerns.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.11.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21168931/,economics

"Introduction:
        
      
      In the majority of developing countries, the volume of medical insurance services, provided by social insurance organizations is inadequate. Thus, supplementary medical insurance is proposed as a means to address inadequacy of medical insurance. Accordingly, in this article, we attempted to provide the context for expansion of this important branch of insurance through identification of essential factors affecting demand for supplementary medical insurance.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In this study, two methods were used to identify essential factors affecting choice of supplementary medical insurance including Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Bayesian logit. To this end, Excel® software was used to refine data and R® software for estimation. The present study was conducted during 2012, covering all provinces in Iran. Sample size included 18,541 urban households, selected by Statistical Center of Iran using 3-stage cluster sampling approach. In this study, all data required were collected from the Statistical Center of Iran.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 2012, an overall 8.04% of the Iranian population benefited from supplementary medical insurance. Demand for supplementary insurance is a concave function of age of the household head, and peaks in middle-age when savings and income are highest. The present study results showed greater likelihood of demand for supplementary medical insurance in households with better economic status, higher educated heads, female heads, and smaller households with greater expected medical expenses, and household income is the most important factor affecting demand for supplementary medical insurance.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Since demand for supplementary medical insurance is hugely influenced by households' economic status, policy-makers in the health sector should devise measures to improve households' economic or financial access to supplementary insurance services, by identifying households in the lower economic deciles, and increasing their financial ability to pay. Moreover, insurance companies should adjust their insurance policy according to clients' needs, household characteristics, and their incomes.",https://doi.org/10.5539/gjhs.v7n6p285,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26153181/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Economic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) has been proposed as the appropriate tool to set priorities for resource allocation among available health interventions. Controversy remains about the way CEA should be used in the field of HIV/AIDS.
    


          Methods and objectives:
        
      
      This paper reviews the general literature in health economics and public economics about the use of CEA for priority setting in public health, in order better to inform current debates about resource allocation in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Theoretical and practical limitations of CEA do not raise major problems when it is applied to compare alternatives for treating the same medical condition or public health problem. Using CEA to set priorities among different health interventions by ranking them from the lowest to the highest values of their cost per life-year saved is appropriate only under the very restrictive and unrealistic assumptions that all interventions compared are discrete and finite alternatives that cannot vary in terms of size and scale. In order for CEA to inform resource allocation compared across programmes to fight the AIDS epidemic, a pragmatic interpretation of this economic approach, like that proposed by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, is better suited. Interventions, like a number of preventive strategies and first-line antiretroviral treatments for HIV, whose marginal costs per additional life-year saved are less than three times the gross domestic product per capita, should be considered cost-effective.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Because of their empirical and theoretical limitations, results of CEA should only be one element in priority setting among interventions for HIV/AIDS, which should also be informed by explicit debates about societal and ethical preferences.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aids.0000327624.69974.41,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18664955/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The extent to which pharmaceutical companies promote the economic advantages of their products in advertisements in medical journals, and whether such claims are supported by evidence, has not been quantified. Our objectives were to examine how often prescription drug advertisements in leading medical journals contain economic messages, and to determine the types of promotional claims made and whether supporting evidence is provided.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All prescription drug advertisements appearing in six leading general medical and specialty journals in 3 selected months annually from 1990 to 1999 were reviewed. Using a standard data collection form, two reviewers examined each ad for economic content-including mention of the drug's price, value, cost saving, or cost-effectiveness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Economic messages appeared in 237 (11.1%) of the 2144 advertisements examined. Proportion of ads with economic content has increased over time (P = 0.003). Most frequently, economic ads contained statements that drugs were ""less expensive"" or ""cost less"" than alternative treatments (50.6% of economic ads). Supporting evidence for economic claims was clearly reported in 63.7% of cases, and typically referred to published drug prices rather than more detailed economic analysis. Ads for calcium channel blocking agents and ACE inhibitors frequently contained economic messages.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economic messages about prescription drugs are used in advertisements in leading medical journals and their frequency may be rising. Physicians should be aware of this phenomenon, and its potential impact on their prescribing decisions. More scrutiny of the supporting evidence underlying economic claims by the medical community and regulators may be needed.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-200209000-00013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12218774/,economics
"States choose to provide Medicaid coverage via managed care or traditional fee-for-service. Managed care provided by private insurers poses higher contracting costs and information asymmetry than traditional fee-for-service but potentially improves efficiency and reduces spending. Evaluating the effect of managed care on Medicaid spending is challenging because adoption of managed care is nonrandom and may be driven by local economic shocks that simultaneously affect Medicaid spending. This study implements a dynamic panel framework to estimate the effect of managed care enrollment on spending levels and program design. Results show reductions in Medicaid spending larger than previously found in cross-state studies: A 10% increase of managed care enrollment reduces state Medicaid spending by 2.94%, or approximately $55 million. The study identifies which areas of spending are differentially affected by managed care enrollment and whether savings from managed care affect Medicaid design, specifically coverage generosity.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3608,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29168257/,economics
"The rising cost of healthcare has strained the resources of governments, private third parties and individuals with responsibility to pay for it. Various strategies have been used in an attempt to control costs. This article examines the economic impact of 4 such strategies: (a) cost sharing; (b) prescription limits; (c) rebates; and (d) cost limits. Cost sharing has been successful at reducing utilisation of prescription drugs, although the effects have not been uniform across therapeutic categories. However, the long term effect on cost and utilisation of other medical services, and the impact on overall health status, remain largely unknown. Some evidence suggests that utilisation of other services may increase. The available data regarding drug rebate programmes have been descriptive in nature. However, the designs employed in this research do not establish a direct causal relationship between rebate programmes and changes in Medicaid drug expenditure. Furthermore, still unknown is the degree of cost shifting and the effect of the rebate programme on other large public and private drug purchasers. The Maximum Allowable Cost programme led to direct savings in drug costs, but the size of these savings was variable and uncertain because of administrative costs of the programme. The Estimated Acquisition Cost programme has not resulted in significant savings.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199304020-00004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10146971/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      Our objective is to review and assess the main pharmaceutical cost-containment policies used in Ireland in recent years, and to highlight how a policy that improved fiscal sustainability but worsened economic sustainability could have improved both if an option-based approach was implemented.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The main public pharmaceutical cost-containment policy measures including reducing the ex-factory price of drugs, pharmacy dispensing fees and community drug scheme coverage, and increasing patient copayments are outlined along with the resulting savings. We quantify the cost implications of a new policy that restricts the entitlement to free prescription drugs of persons older than 70 years and propose an alternative option-based policy that reduces the total cost to both the state and the patient.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This set of policy measures reduced public spending on community drugs by an estimated €380m in 2011. The policy restricting free prescription drugs for persons older than 70 years, though effective in reducing public cost, increased the total cost of the drugs supplied. The policy-induced cost increase stems from a fees anomaly between the two main community drugs schemes which is circumvented by our alternative option-based policy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our findings highlight the need for policymakers, even when absorbed with reducing cost, to design cost-containment policies that are both fiscally and economically sustainable.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2011.10.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22433772/,economics
"This article reviews efforts in the United States and several other member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to encourage patients, through cost sharing, to use goods such as medications, services, and providers that offer better value than other options--an approach known as value-based cost sharing. Among the countries we reviewed, we found that value-based approaches were most commonly applied to drug cost sharing. A few countries, including the United States, employed financial incentives, such as lower copayments, to encourage use of preferred providers or preventive services. Evidence suggests that these efforts can increase patients' use of high-value services--although they may also be associated with high administrative costs and could exacerbate health inequalities among various groups. With careful design, implementation, and evaluation, value-based cost sharing can be an important tool for aligning patient and provider incentives to pursue high-value care.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23569050/,economics
"Against a background of increasing demands on limited resources, studies that relate benefits of health interventions to the resources they consume will be an important part of any decision-making process in primary care, and an accurate assessment of costs will be an important part of any economic evaluation. Although there is no such thing as a gold standard cost estimate, there are a number of basic costing concepts that underlie any costing study. How costs are derived and combined will depend on the assumptions that have been made in their derivation. It is important to be clear what assumptions have been made and why in order to maintain consistency across comparative studies and prevent inappropriate conclusions being drawn.

"For the fourth consecutive year, growth in health care spending remained low, increasing by 3.7 percent in 2012 to $2.8 trillion. At the same time, the share of the economy devoted to health fell slightly (from 17.3 percent to 17.2 percent) as the nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.6 percent. Faster growth in hospital services and in physician and clinical services was mitigated by slower growth in prices for prescription drugs and nursing home services. Despite an uptick in enrollment growth, Medicare spending growth slowed slightly in 2012, mainly due to lower payment updates.

"Healthcare decision makers and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly using techniques of economic evaluation, particularly modelling, to assist them in their decisions about drug purchasing and drug development. The use of models in other types of policy decisions is also well established. One option, to shorten the time to a purchasing decision, would be for an interim decision for approval for reimbursement to be based on an economic model. Such a system would mainly benefit the drug development process and thus the pharmaceutical industry; however the approach could also lead to poor decision making, unethical marketing and withdrawal of drugs from the consumer. In this article, we consider the option of a two-stage economic appraisal process from the point of view of the seller, the purchaser and the patient and public. Although a two-stage process may offer some advantages in terms of early return on investment and access, there are significant disadvantages in terms of certainty about effects and public policy and expenditure. Until there are better methods of predicting the effectiveness of a new product, it is unlikely that interim decisions can be seen as a reasonable health policy alternative, although it seems likely that industry may continue to lobby for such an approach.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200321110-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12859218/,economics

We discuss numerous forces that will contribute to spending growth, including technology, which is likely to continue to raise costs. We also find that hospital spending by baby boomers grew more rapidly than that of the elderly, a change in trend that could presage increased spending as this cohort moves into higher-spending age groups.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.22.6.12,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14649429/,economics

"Arrow asserted that a variety of institutional arrangements and observable mores of the medical profession were functional responses to the failure of the market to insure against uncertainties. But one of these norms--the ethic to provide treatment without regard to ability to pay--was also a response to the failure of the political system to assure the elderly and poor would not suffer more than others when they got sick. This ethic is strikingly different from the norm in most other areas of the economy. Automobile dealers and department stores are not expected to give away their products to the poor; neither are grocery stores or farmers. Public education is a closer analogy, reflecting the norm that all children deserve a good education. In education, however, unlike in medicine, we collectively support this norm by providing public funds to accomplish this goal rather than by relying on the private market. In 1963, physicians argued that a combination of the market and private philanthropy (including the obligations of physicians) would be sufficient to guarantee high-quality care for the elderly and the poor. Government financing, they argued, would lead to socialized medicine, impairing relationships between physicians and patients and between physicians and society. Based on his article, Arrow would not have agreed. Neither, apparently, did the public. The enactment of Medicare indicated, in part, that many people understood, even in 1965, the extent to which treatment choices and outcomes were affected by ability to pay. Events since 1965 suggest that there is some tension between insurance and ethical responses to uncertainty despite Arrow's endorsement of both. I have argued here that Medicare and Medicaid further eroded the ethic that treatment should be available without regard to ability to pay by reducing physician willingness to provide charity care and by reducing the resources available to public hospitals and the interest of private teaching hospitals in providing care to the uninsured poor. Largely independent of Medicare and Medicaid, the increasing importance of pharmaceuticals and other services delivered outside of the hospital further strengthened the connection between treatment choices and ability to pay, and the growth of capitated payment systems made this connection salient to many insured patients and their physicians. In part, then, the AMA was correct: Medicare and Medicaid have contributed to the erosion of trust in physicians as incorruptible agents for patients. Some of this trust undoubtedly was misplaced, even in 1965, and trust alone was not sufficient to guarantee widespread access to medical care or to assure that treatment provided would take true social benefits and costs into account. Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the growth of prepayment insurance plans, represent institutional responses to the failure of the 1963 norms to accomplish societal goals. Still, as we have seen, these responses create their own challenges, and we continue to search for institutions that will allow widespread insurance to coexist with the physician-patient trust that Arrow correctly identified as an important response to uncertainties and information asymmetries in the medical care market.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-26-5-993,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11765276/,economics
"The adoption of new technologies for the treatment of periodontitis and the replacement of teeth has changed the delivery of periodontal care. The objective of this review was to conduct an economic analysis of a mature periodontal service market with a well-developed workforce, including general dentists, dental hygienists and periodontists. Publicly available information about the delivery of periodontal care in the USA was used. A strong trend toward increased utilization of nonsurgical therapy and decreased utilization of surgical periodontal therapy was observed. Although periodontal surgery remained the domain of periodontists, general dentists had taken over most of the nonsurgical periodontal care. The decline in surgical periodontal therapy was associated with an increased utilization of implant-supported prosthesis. Approximately equal numbers of implants were surgically placed by periodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and general dentists. Porter's framework of the forces driving industry competition was used to analyze the role of patients, dental insurances, general dentists, competitors, entrants, substitutes and suppliers in the periodontal service market. Estimates of out-of-pocket payments of self-pay and insured patients, reimbursement by dental insurances and providers' earnings for various periodontal procedures and alternative treatments were calculated. Economic incentives for providers may explain some of the observed shifts in the periodontal service market. Given the inherent uncertainty about treatment outcomes in dentistry, which makes clinical judgment critical, providers may yield to economic incentives without jeopardizing their ethical standards and professional norms. Although the economic analysis pertains to the USA, some considerations may also apply to other periodontal service markets.",https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23574473/,economics
"A new tax credit to help low-income families and individuals purchase health insurance can address the problem of affordability, but will not overcome other barriers these populations face in obtaining coverage. This paper proposes that families have the option of using a new tax credit to buy into a state-administered system such as Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program. This option has three advantages. First, it allows families to remain with a single health program and health plan as their income fluctuates. Second, it provides an alternative to the complex and confusing individual insurance market. This alternative is community rated, does not use underwriting, and allows health plan behavior to be monitored closely by the state. Third, it allows the state to act as a financial buffer-helping overcome the barrier to participation that cash-flow problems and year-end reconciliation concerns are likely to create among a low-income population. Many people would want to use their tax credit in the private market, but the buy-in option increases the likelihood that the tax credit approach would succeed.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_38.2.146,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11529512/,economics
"In recent years, as a result of the rapid growth in the costs of health care, there has been an explosion of interest in the area of economic evaluation. Diabetes has emerged as an economic problem because of the increasing costs of treatments for diabetes and of educational programmes for patients with type II diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM). In addition to the cost-of-illness analyses, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit analyses are the major methods for evaluating the economic efficiency of diabetes treatments, and educational or control programmes. This article briefly reviews some conceptual issues relating to these evaluative methods; if the methods of estimating costs are generally similar for the different evaluative methods, the 3 forms of evaluation vary in the way they assess the outcomes. A more consistent application of recent methods of economic evaluation could improve understanding of the economic consequences of type II diabetes for the individual and society as a whole.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199500081-00013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10159006/,economics
"The current status of state and local strategies to contain health care expenditures in the United States is described. These strategies are classified as predominantly regulatory, competitive or voluntary. The actions of two major groups of purchasers of care--state government programs for the indigent and private employers--in support of expenditure containment strategies are discussed as well. The large number of approaches to expenditure containment currently being attempted, and their diverse character, are hypothesized to be a result not only of increased health care inflation and the concern it causes purchasers of care, but also of fundamental changes in the health care industry in the United States which have realigned traditional provider interest groups.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(85)90387-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3927490/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the literature on risk-sharing agreements, including conceptual, theoretical and empirical (number of agreements and their achievements) perspectives, and stakeholders' perceptions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE from 2000 to April 2019, following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology, and completed it with a manual search of other publications (mainly grey literature). The search was restricted to publications with English abstracts; the initial identification of articles was restricted to the title, abstract and key words fields. The geographical scope was not restricted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over 20 studies proposed different taxonomies of risk-sharing contracts, which can be summarised as financial and paying-for-performance agreements. Theoretical studies modelling the incentives to implement risk-sharing agreements are scarce; they addressed different types of contracts and regulatory contexts, characterizing the drug prices and the optimal strategies of the involved agents. Empirical studies describing specific agreements are abundant and referred to different geographical contexts; however, few articles showed the economic results and assessed the value of such contracts. Stakeholders' perceptions of risk-sharing contracting were favourable, but little is known about the economic and clinical advantages of specific agreements. Whether risk-sharing contracts have yielded the desired results for healthcare systems remains uncertain.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Risk-sharing contracts are increasingly used, although the lack of transparency and aggregated registries makes it difficult to learn from these experiences and assess their impact on healthcare systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00838-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31535280/,economics
"This paper examines the behaviour of public hospitals in response to the average payment incentives created by price changes for patients classified in different diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Using panel data on public hospitals located within the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, we test whether a 1-year increase in DRG prices induced public hospitals to increase their volume of activity and whether a potential response is associated with changes in waiting times and/or length of stay. We find that public hospitals reacted to the policy change by increasing the number of patients with surgical treatments. This effect was smaller in the 2 years after the policy change than in later years, and for providers with a lower excess capacity in the pre-policy period, whereas it did not vary significantly across hospitals according to their degree of financial and administrative autonomy. For patients with medical DRGs, instead, there appeared to be no effect on inpatient volumes. Our estimates also suggest that an increase in DRG prices had no impact on the proportion of patients waiting more than 6 months. Finally, we find no evidence of a significant effect on patients' average length of stay.

"Public health programmes tend to be complex and may combine social strategies with aspects of empowerment, capacity building and knowledge across sectors. The nature of the programmes means that some effects are likely to occur outside the healthcare sector; this breadth impacts on the choice of health and non-health outcomes to measure and value in an economic evaluation. Employing conventional outcome measures in evaluations of public health has been questioned. There are concerns that such measures are too narrow, overlook important dimensions of programme effect and, thus, lead to such interventions being undervalued. This issue is of particular importance for low-income and middle-income countries, which face considerable budget constraints, yet deliver a large proportion of health activities within public health programmes. The need to develop outcome measures, which include broader measures of quality of life, has given impetus to the development of a variety of new, holistic approaches, including Sen's capability framework and measures of subjective wellbeing. Despite their promise, these approaches have not yet been widely applied, perhaps because they present significant methodological challenges. This paper outlines the methodological challenges for the identification and measurement of broader outcomes of public health interventions in economic evaluation in low-income and middle-income countries.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3302,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804360/,economics
"The recent decline, indeed perhaps dismantling, of managed care is sometimes treated as both consequence and cause of the political reempowerment of medical providers, whose professional dominance managed care had challenged. Drawing evidence from Round III of the Community Tracking Study of the Center for Studying Health System Change, this article reviews the politics of four ""arenas"" of managed care regulation--prompt payment, mandated benefits, external appeals, and financial solvency--and concludes that the power of providers is contingent on patterns of coalition and conflict that differ across the discrete arenas. The zero-sum connotations of the ""de"" and ""re"" empowerment of providers under managed care fail to capture the subtlety of providers' search for fresh cultural, economic, and political resources in shifting policy contexts.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-29-6-1045,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15688577/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Anxiety disorders (AD) are common mental disorders, for which several cost-of-illness (COI) studies have been conducted in the past.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview of these studies and an aggregation of their results.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search limited to studies published after 1999 was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE in November 2018. We included top-down COI studies reporting costs for AD, and bottom-up COI studies reporting costs for AD and a non-diseased control group, and extracted data manually. Results of the top-down COI studies were aggregated by calculating the mean percentage of costs on gross domestic product (GDP) and health expenditure, while the results of the bottom-up studies were analyzed meta-analytically using the 'ratio of means' method and inverse-variance pooling. In this review, the logarithm of the relative difference in a continuous outcome between two groups is calculated and aggregated over the studies. The results can be interpreted as the relative change in costs imposed by a specific disease compared with baseline costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 13 top-down and 11 bottom-up COI studies. All top-down COI studies and four bottom-up COI studies reported costs for AD as a diagnostic group, four for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), four for social anxiety disorder (SAD), and one for panic disorder. In top-down COI studies, direct costs of AD, on average, corresponded to 2.08% of health care costs and 0.22% of GDP, whereas indirect costs, on average, corresponded to 0.23% of GDP. In bottom-up COI studies, direct costs of patients with AD were increased by factor 2.17 (1.29-3.67; p = 0.004) and indirect costs were increased by factor 1.92 (1.05-3.53; p = 0.04), whereas total costs increased by factor 2.52 (1.73-3.68; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed an increase in direct costs by 1.60 (1.16-2.22; p = 0.005) for SAD and 2.60 (2.01-3.36; p < 0.001) for GAD. Measures of heterogeneity indicated high heterogeneity when pooling studies for direct costs, indirect costs, and total costs, but low to moderate heterogeneity when pooling studies for SAD or GAD.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using methods that focused on relative rather than absolute costs, we were able to aggregate costs reported in different COI studies for ADs. We found that ADs were associated with a low proportion of health care costs on a population level, but significantly increased health care costs on an individual level compared with healthy controls. Our disorder-specific subgroup analysis showed that study findings are most homogeneous within specific ADs. Therefore, to get a more detailed picture of the costs of ADs, more studies for currently under researched ADs, such as panic disorder, are needed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00849-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31646432/,economics
"Insurance carriers, corporations, and labor groups are actively developing and marketing dental capitation benefit plans. Incentives to both dentists and patients in these plans differ from those in the traditional fee-for-service system used with conventional benefit plans. This paper describes the likely effects of these incentive differences on utilization and service-mix patterns in both systems. Data for a large (approximately 10,000), homogenous group of subscribers are presented and discussed. Faced with a dual option, at no cost to the employee, 60% of the subscribers chose the fee-for-service plan, and 40% chose the capitation plan. Observed differences in the utilization and mix of services between the two plans cannot be explained solely in terms of dentists' responses.

"Background:
        
      
      Increasing costs have generated concern among governments and healthcare providers who have realized the need for cost containment measures and more efficient resource utilization. Health economics is one potential source of information that can make healthcare more efficient.
    


          Scope:
        
      
      This review article summarizes the published literature on self-reported attitudes of healthcare decision-makers towards economic evaluations of medical technologies and examines the extent to which economic evaluations are used in health policy decisions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review of published English language studies was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and HEED from January 1995 to December 2007.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Fifty-five articles investigated the use of economic evaluations on three levels of decision-making: central, local, and physician level. Results indicate the use of economic evaluation information increased from limited/minor to moderate use. The influence of economic evaluations increased with the level of centralization of healthcare system. Barriers to use health economics research varied across levels and included health economics research-related barriers such as timely availability, lack of credibility, insufficient methodological quality and decision-context-related barriers including limited decision makers' knowledge, inflexibility in healthcare budgets and variability among healthcare organizations.
    


          Conclusions:

"Background:
        
      
      Economic aspects related to the German health care system are rising. In the outpatient area does this trend influence the organization of the surgery and the treatment procedures as well as the relationship between the patient and the doctor. The patient's free volition of choice is increasing and the patient becomes a ""customer"" in the health system. The aim of this work is to to elucidate marketing issues for otorhinolaryngologist, which could improve the efficiency of their surgery.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      150 otorhinolaryngologist have undergone a written survey. The subjects of this survey were, how far marketing strategies are used by otolaryngologists and on the other hand, what are their opinions on marketing.
    


          Results:
        
      
      115 returned questionnaires were included in the statistical analysis (response rate: 77%). Only 44% of surveyed otolaryngologists deal yet with economic aspects. After all, 65% of the otorhinolaryngologist offered individual health services. On the other hand only 51% of otolaryngologists were additionaly qualificated and only 14% would like to acquire more skills. At the time of the survey 78% conducted a homepage.

"Biosurfactants are economically most sought after biotechnological compounds of the 21st century. However, inefficient bioprocessing has mitigated the economical commercial production of these compounds. Although much work is being done on the use of low-cost substrates for their production, a paucity of literature exists on the upcoming bioprocess optimization strategies and their successes and potential for economical biosurfactant production. This review discusses some of the latest developments and most promising strategies to enhance and economize the biosurfactant production process. Recent market analysis, developments in the field of optimally formulated cost credit substrates for enhanced product formation and subsequent process economization are few of the critical aspects highlighted here. Use of nanoparticles and coproduction of biosurfactant along with other commercially important compounds like enzymes, are other upcoming bioprocess intensification strategies. The recent developments discussed here would not only give an overview of pertinent parameters for economic biosurfactant production but would also bring to fore multiple strategies that would open up new avenues of research on biosurfactant production.

We examine the extent to which UC employees switched plans in response to this change in premiums. Our results indicate a strong response.

"Objective:
        
      
      Pertussis is a highly contagious infection affecting mainly children. Acellular pertussis vaccines were recently introduced in Canada based on evidence of improved safety and efficacy over whole cell vaccines, the current standard of care. The following study reports the economic impact of replacing the whole cell vaccine (wP) by a new acellular vaccine (aP) in the Ontario pertussis immunisation programme.
    


          Design:
        
      
      For a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 children from birth to the age of 8 years, the costs and consequences of pertussis vaccination with either aP or wP were compared. A decision analytical model was constructed for vaccine delivery, treatment of pertussis cases and vaccine adverse events, with analyses from the viewpoints of the Ontario Ministry of Health and society.
    


          Main outcome measures and results:
        
      
      The main outcomes were expected number of pertussis cases, hospitalisations, and workdays lost by parents. Data on vaccine effectiveness, pertussis incidence, and other parameters used in the model were from published literature. Costs were discounted at 5%, and extensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Over 8 years, in a cohort of 100,000 children, the introduction of aP would prevent 10,500 cases of pertussis, avoiding 504 hospital admissions and 73,500 days of work absence. For Ontario, healthcare cost savings over the same period would amount to 275,585 Canadian dollars ($Can), and societal savings to $Can9,752,864",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200119050-00009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465300/,economics
"Many health insurance systems apply managed competition principles to control costs and quality of health care. Besides other factors, managed competition relies on a sufficient price-elastic demand. This paper presents a systematic review of empirical studies on price elasticity of demand for health insurance. The objective was to identify the differing international ranges of price elasticity and to find socio-economic as well as setting-oriented factors that influence price elasticity. Relevant literature for the topic was identified through a two-step identification process including a systematic search in appropriate databases and further searches within the references of the results. A total of 45 studies from countries such as the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland were found. Clear differences in price elasticity by countries were identified. While empirical studies showed a range between -0.2 and -1.0 for optional primary health insurance in the US, higher price elasticities between -0.6 and -4.2 for Germany and around -2 for Switzerland were calculated for mandatory primary health insurance. Dutch studies found price elasticities below -0.5. In consideration of all relevant studies, age and poorer health status were identified to decrease price elasticity. Other socio-economic factors had an unclear impact or too limited evidence. Premium level, range of premiums, homogeneity of benefits/coverage and degree of forced decision were found to have a major influence on price elasticity in their settings. Further influence was found from supplementary insurance and premium-dependent employer contribution.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-014-0650-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25398619/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to determine change in value of a vascular surgery division to the health care system during 6 years at a hospital-based academic practice and to compare physician vs hospital revenue earned during this period.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Total revenue generated by the vascular surgery service line at an academic medical center from 2010 through 2015 was evaluated. Total revenue was measured as the sum of physician (professional) and hospital (technical) net revenue for all vascular-related patient care. Adjustments were made for work performed, case complexity, and inflation. To reflect the effect of these variables, net revenue was indexed to work relative value units (wRVUs), case mix index, and consumer price index, which adjusted for work, case complexity, and inflation, respectively. Differences in physician and hospital net revenue were compared over time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Physician work, measured in RVUs per year, increased by 4%; case complexity, assessed with case mix index, increased by 10% for the 6-year measurement period. Despite stability in payer mix at 64% to 69% Medicare, both physician and hospital vascular-related revenue/wRVU decreased during this period. Unadjusted professional revenue/wRVU declined by 14.1% (P = .09); when considering case complexity, physician revenue/wRVU declined by 20.6% (P = .09). Taking into account both case complexity and inflation, physician revenue declined by 27.0% (P = .04). Comparatively, hospital revenue for vascular surgery services decreased by 13.8% (P = .07) when adjusting for unit work, complexity, and inflation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      At medical centers where vascular surgeons are hospital based, vascular care reimbursement decreased substantially from 2010 to 2015 when case complexity and inflation were considered. Physician reimbursement (professional fees) decreased at a significantly greater rate than hospital reimbursement for vascular care. This trend has significant implications for salaried vascular surgeons in hospital-based settings, where the majority of revenue generated by vascular surgery care is the technical component received by the facility. Appropriate care for patients with vascular disease is increasingly resource intensive, and as a corollary, reimbursement levels must reflect this situation if high-quality care is to be maintained.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2017.03.417,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28502549/,economics

"Economics provides a framework for understanding management decisions and their policy implications for the animal health system. While the neoclassical economic model is useful for framing animal health decisions on the farm, some of its assumptions and prescriptive results may be unrealistic. Institutional and behavioural economics address some of these potential shortcomings by considering the role of information, psychology and social factors in decisions. Framing such decisions under contract theory allows us to consider asymmetric information between policy-makers and farmers. Perverse incentives may exist in the area of preventing and reporting disease. Behavioural economics examines the role of internal and external psychological and social factors. Biases, heuristics, habit, social norms and other such aspects can result in farm decision-makers arriving at what might be considered irrational or otherwise sub-optimal decisions. Framing choices and providing relevant information and examples can alleviate these behavioural issues. The implications of this approach for disease policy and an applied research and outreach programme to respond to animal diseases are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.36.1.2610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28926027/,economics
"This study investigates dynamic incentives to select patients for hospitals that are remunerated according to a prospective payment system of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) type. Using a model with patients differing in severity within a DRG, we show that price dynamics depend on the extent of hospital altruism and the relation between patients' severity and benefit. Upwards and downwards price movements over time are both possible. In a steady state, DRG prices are unlikely to give optimal incentives to treat patients. Depending on the level of altruism, too few or too many patients are treated. DRG pricing may also give incentives to treat low-severity patients even though high-severity patients should be treated.

At the same time, terrorism is a worldwide phenomenon that affects human life, FDI inflows, economic growth, and, most importantly, environmental well-being. Hence, it can be expected that there are relationships between terrorism, foreign direct investment inflows, and carbon dioxide emissions. However, in the previous literature, less attention has been given to explore these nexuses. In addition, the possible non-linearities in data are also mostly ignored in the preceding related studies. Against this backdrop, this paper explores the linear and non-linear influences of terrorism and foreign direct investment inflows on carbon dioxide emissions, controlling for energy consumption and economic growth within the model, on carbon dioxide emissions in the context of ten global economies that are most impacted by terrorism. To this end, we used the data from 1973 to 2016 and deployed the linear and non-linear autoregressive distributed lag methods to scrutinize the environmental impacts of the explanatory variables of concern. The results confirmed the presence of non-linearities in the relationships between terrorism, inflows of foreign direct investments, and carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the positive shocks to terrorism and foreign direct investment inflows significantly deteriorate the environment with a dominating effect. Unlike the previous studies, this current study validates the pollution haven hypothesis for the sample economies. Energy consumption and economic growth were also evidenced to exacerbate the carbon dioxide emission levels in all selected countries. Based on these results, we recommend that our sample economies should focus on promoting education, employment, economic stability, and public awareness to eradicate terrorism which, in turn, can mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide further. In addition, stringent environmental regulations on foreign direct investment inflows are required to reduce the adverse environmental effects of such sources of foreign finance. Furthermore, the international firms should be encouraged to invest in cleaner technologies by offering them tax benefits and other financial incentives.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15188-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34296403/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      The standardization of the profit in the public health system causes the question if obstetrical departments of different structures can work cost-coveringly and which services in the DRG-system operate in deficit or profitably. This problem mainly refers to the hospitals of obstetrical maximal care, namely the perinatal centre of level I.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Based on the body cost accounting according to InEK-Matrix the average actual costs of an obstetrical department level IV, a perinatal centre level I and university hospitals were found out for the obstetrical DRGs and compared with the profits calculated by InEK. An analysis of the costs was carried out concerning the cost relevance for different cost areas.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Spontaneous delivery was the service that turned out to be cost-covering in all structures. The real costs of caesarean sections, however, as well as those of some vaginal kinds of delivery, mainly pre-mature births and complicated diagnoses turned out to be not cost-covering. However, the perinatal centre was able to compensate the deficit by the high number of vaginal deliveries. The actual personel costs for physicians were higher in the perinatal center than the InEK-calculation for all obstetrical DRGs. The costs of nursery and the costs of the non-medical infrastructure were partly smaller than those of the InEK-calculation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A perinatal center level I can operate cost-coveringly on the basis of the DRG system. To achieve this it's not necessary to increase the number of caesarean sections, but what is needed instead is a high number of normal deliveries and an economical non-medical infrastructure and care.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1267921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21031329/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Nearly half of the Irish population is covered by private health insurance. In recent years, premium inflation has been significantly ahead of overall inflation and has been accelerating. This has contributing to a drop in the numbers insured since the peak in 2008. The fall in the numbers with private health insurance also has implications for the public health system.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Factors behind this premium inflation include rising charges for beds in public hospitals, increasing volume of treatments and increasing quality of service and cover.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      While some progress has been made by insurers on reducing fees paid to consultants and private hospitals, unless the quantity or quality of care are addressed then premium inflation is unlikely to abate.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-013-0929-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23475440/,economics
"Even though most American retirees benefit from Medicare coverage, a mounting body of research predicts that many will face large and increasing out-of-pocket expenditures for healthcare costs in retirement and that many already struggle to finance these costs. It is unclear, however, whether the general population understands the likely magnitude of these out-of-pocket expenditures well enough to plan for them effectively. This study is the first comprehensive examination of Americans' expectations regarding their out-of-pocket spending on healthcare in retirement. We surveyed over 1700 near retirees and retirees to assess their expectations regarding their own spending and then compared their responses to experts' estimates. Our main findings are twofold. First, overall expectations of out-of-pocket spending are mixed. While a significant proportion of respondents estimated out-of-pocket costs in retirement at or above expert estimates of what the typical retiree will spend, a disproportionate number estimated their future spending substantially below what experts view as likely. Estimates by members of some demographic subgroups, including women and younger respondents, deviated relatively further from the experts' estimates. Second, respondents consistently misjudged spending uncertainty. In particular, respondents significantly underestimated how much individual health experience and changes in government policy can affect individual out-of-pocket spending. We discuss possible policy responses, including efforts to improve financial planning and ways to reduce unanticipated financial risk through reform of health insurance regulation.",https://doi.org/10.1177/009885881303900102,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23678788/,economics

"This article introduces the role economics can play in deciding whether programs designed to prevent mental disorders, which carry large disease and economic burdens, are a worthwhile use of limited healthcare resources. Fortunately, preventive interventions for mental disorders exist; however, which interventions should be financed is a common issue facing decision makers, and economic evaluation can provide answers. Unfortunately, existing economic evaluations of preventive interventions have limited applicability to local healthcare contexts. An approach to priority setting largely based on economic techniques-Assessing Cost-Effectiveness (ACE)-has been developed and used in Australia to answer questions regarding the economic credentials of competing interventions. Eleven preventive interventions for mental disorders and suicide, mostly psychological in nature, have been evaluated using this approach, with many meeting the criteria of good value for money. Interventions targeting the prevention of suicide, adult and childhood depression, childhood anxiety, and early psychosis have particular merit.",https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104601,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21443447/,economics
"Despite uncertainty being intrinsic to economic evaluation of health care, existing techniques for handling uncertainty remain underdeveloped compared to the formal techniques commonly applied in the business sector. This paper develops an alternative approach to handling uncertainty in economic evaluation based on 'option-pricing' techniques. The presence of uncertainty and the degree of irreversibility of a decision make it clear that some flexibility in the timing of a decision is often a desirable characteristic with an economic value. We demonstrate how option-pricing techniques can be applied to the decision rules for economic evaluation in health care. The key determinants of an option value are the presence and type of uncertainty; the ability to defer a decision; and the irreversibility of the decision. The relative significance of each of these for a particular economic evaluation will depend on the particular characteristics of the technology under consideration.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(00)00048-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11184803/,economics
"The privately insured are assuming a greater share of the costs of their health care, yet little is known about changes in out-of-pocket spending at the state level. The central problem is that national surveys with the relevant data are not designed to generate state-level estimates. The study addresses this shortcoming by using a two-sample modeling approach to estimate state-level measures of out-of-pocket spending relative to income for privately insured adults and children. National data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Household Component and state representative data from the Current Population Survey are used. Variation in out-of-pocket spending over time and across states is shown, highlighting concern about the adequacy of coverage for 2.9% of privately insured children and 7.8% of privately insured adults. Out-of-pocket spending relative to income is an important indicator of access to care and should be monitored at the state level.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1077558708330426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19151260/,economics
"Context:
        
      
      Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage (MA), now almost 30 years old, has generally been viewed as a policy disappointment. Enrollment has vacillated but has never come close to the penetration of managed care plans in the commercial insurance market or in Medicaid, and because of payment policy decisions and selection, the MA program is viewed as having added to cost rather than saving funds for the Medicare program. Recent changes in Medicare policy, including improved risk adjustment, however, may have changed this picture.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This article summarizes findings from our group's work evaluating MA's recent performance and investigating payment options for improving its performance even more. We studied the behavior of both beneficiaries and plans, as well as the effects of Medicare policy.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Beneficiaries make ""mistakes"" in their choice of MA plan options that can be explained by behavioral economics. Few beneficiaries make an active choice after they enroll in Medicare. The high prevalence of ""zero-premium"" plans signals inefficiency in plan design and in the market's functioning. That is, Medicare premium policies interfere with economically efficient choices. The adverse selection problem, in which healthier, lower-cost beneficiaries tend to join MA, appears much diminished. The available measures, while limited, suggest that, on average, MA plans offer care of equal or higher quality and for less cost than traditional Medicare (TM). In counties, greater MA penetration appears to improve TM's performance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medicare policies regarding lock-in provisions and risk adjustment that were adopted in the mid-2000s have mitigated the adverse selection problem previously plaguing MA. On average, MA plans appear to offer higher value than TM, and positive spillovers from MA into TM imply that reimbursement should not necessarily be neutral. Policy changes in Medicare that reform the way that beneficiaries are charged for MA plan membership are warranted to move more beneficiaries into MA.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12061,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24890251/,economics
"The most common solutions to the problem of high pharmaceutical prices have taken the form of regulations, price negotiations, or changes in drug coverage by insurers. These measures for the most part transfer the burden of drug expenditures between pharmaceutical companies and payers or between payers. The aim of this study is to propose an alternative model for the relationship between the main stakeholders (the pharmaceutical companies, third party payers, and the public) involved in the price setting and purchasing of pharmaceuticals, one that encourages a more cooperative approach. We draw from principles of ethics and health economics and apply them to the context of the pharmaceutical industry. The model prioritises two objectives, (1) to make drugs financially accessible to the patients who need them, and (2) to keep pharmaceutical companies viable and profitable. It is centered around the sharing of financial risk between the main stakeholders, which we describe as 'enlightened risk sharing'. After establishing the foundations of this model, we expand on the type of policies that can follow these principles with current day examples.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10728-020-00394-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232611/,economics
"Aim:
        
      
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, chronic autoimmune disease associated with a substantial economic burden. This study aimed to assess the costs associated with SSc and to identify major cost drivers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase to identify relevant studies. Two independent reviewers evaluated studies based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and performed data extraction. Costs were converted into 2017 US dollars by purchasing power parity. The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The original literature search identified 113 potentially relevant citations, of which 10 articles met all the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the data extraction and analysis. The identified studies evaluated costs associated with SSc in 11 countries from North America, Europe, and Australia published between 2009 and 2018. Eight studies reported direct costs and seven studies reported indirect costs. Direct costs varied from $3356 (Hungary) to $27 032 (Germany) with hospitalization and medication being two of the biggest components of direct medical costs in most studies. The indirect costs for lost productivity varied from $2433 (Italy) to $20 663 (UK), accounting for a significant portion of the total economic burden.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Large variations existed in annual costs of SSc, but all studies found that SSc imposed a substantial economic burden on patients and their families. The identified studies were mostly from high-income countries and there is still a knowledge gap regarding the cost of SSc in other parts of the world.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.14270,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970861/,economics

"The United States has the most expensive health care system in the world, with per capita health expenditures far above those of any other nation. For many years, U.S. health care expenditures have been growing above the overall rate of inflation in the economy. A few experts have argued that high and rising costs are not such a serious problem. Most observers disagree with this view, pointing to the negative impact of employee health care costs on employers, the government budgetary problems caused by rising health care expenditures, and an association between high health care costs and reduced access for individuals needing health services. Several explanations have been offered for high and rising health care costs. These include the perspectives that high and rising costs are created by forces external to the health system, by the weakness of a competitive free market within the health system, by the rapid diffusion of new technologies, by excessive costs of administering the health system, by the absence of strong cost-containment measures, and by undue market power of health care providers. This article, the first in a 4-part series, discusses 3 perspectives on health care: 1) Are high and rising health care costs a serious problem? 2) Are rising costs explained by factors outside the health care system? 3) Does the absence of a free market in health care explain why costs are high and rising? The remaining 3 articles in this series address other perspectives on health care costs.",https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-142-10-200505170-00010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15897535/,economics
"Many low-income countries need to substantially increase expenditure to meet universal coverage goals for essential health services but, because they have very low-incomes, most will be unable to raise adequate funds exclusively from domestic sources in the short to medium term. Increased aid for health will be required. However, there has long been a concern that the rapid arrival of large amounts of foreign exchange in a country could lead to an increase in inflation and loss of international competitiveness, with an adverse impact on exports and economic growth, an economic phenomenon termed 'Dutch disease'. We review cross-country and country-level empirical studies and propose a simple framework to gauge the extent of macroeconomic risks. Of the 15 low-income countries that are increasing aid-financed health spending, 7 have high macroeconomic risks that may constrain the sustained expansion of spending. These conditions also apply in one-quarter of the 42 countries not presently increasing spending. Health authorities should be aware of the multiple risk factors at play, including factors that are health-sector specific and others that generally are not. They should also realize that there are effective means for mitigating the risk of Dutch disease associated with increasing development assistance for health. International partners also have an important role to play since more sustainable and predictable flows of donor funding will allow more productivity enhancing investment in physical and human capital, which will also contribute to ensuring there are few harmful macroeconomic effects of increases in aid.",https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.08.053090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19030692/,economics
"For 2011-13, US health spending is projected to grow at 4.0 percent, on average--slightly above the historically low growth rate of 3.8 percent in 2009. Preliminary data suggest that growth in consumers' use of health services remained slow in 2011, and this pattern is expected to continue this year and next. In 2014, health spending growth is expected to accelerate to 7.4 percent as the major coverage expansions from the Affordable Care Act begin. For 2011 through 2021, national health spending is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.7 percent annually, which would be 0.9 percentage point faster than the expected annual increase in the gross domestic product during this period. By 2021, federal, state, and local government health care spending is projected to be nearly 50 percent of national health expenditures, up from 46 percent in 2011, with federal spending accounting for about two-thirds of the total government share. Rising government spending on health care is expected to be driven by faster growth in Medicare enrollment, expanded Medicaid coverage, and the introduction of premium and cost-sharing subsidies for health insurance exchange plans.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22692089/,economics

Survivors with comorbidities incurred significantly more in total medical costs, out-of-pocket costs, and costs by service type compared to cancer survivors without additional comorbidities.

"Postoperative complications (PC) are a basic health outcome, but no surgery service in the world records and/or audits the PC associated with all the surgical procedures it performs. Most studies that have assessed the cost of PC suffer from poor quality and a lack of transparency and consistency. The payment system in place often rewards the volume of services provided rather than the quality of patients' clinical outcomes. Without a thorough registration of PC, the economic costs involved cannot be determined. An accurate, reliable appraisal would help identify areas for investment in order to reduce the incidence of PC, improve surgical results, and bring down the economic costs. This article describes how to quantify and classify PC using the Clavien-Dindo classification and the comprehensive complication index, discusses the perspectives from which economic evaluations are performed and the minimum postoperative follow-up established, and makes various recommendations. The availability of accurate and impartially audited data on PC will help reduce their incidence and bring down costs.

"This article aims to evaluate the results of two different approaches underlying the attempts to reduce health inequalities in France. In the 'instrumental' approach, resource allocation is based on an indicator to assess the well-being or the quality of life associated with healthcare provision, the argument being that additional resources would respond to needs that could then be treated quickly and efficiently. This governs the distribution of regional hospital budgets. In the second approach, health professionals and users in a given region are involved in a consensus process to define those priorities to be included in programme formulation. This 'procedural' approach is employed in the case of the regional health programmes. In this second approach, the evaluation of the results runs parallel with an analysis of the process using Rawlsian principles, whereas the first approach is based on the classical economic model.At this stage, a pragmatic analysis based on both the comparison of regional hospital budgets during the period 1992-2003 (calculated using a 'RAWP [resource allocation working party]-like' formula) and the evolution of regional health policies through the evaluation of programmes for the prevention of suicide, alcohol-related diseases and cancers provides a partial assessment of the impact of the two types of approaches, the second having a greater effect on the reduction of regional inequalities.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00148365-200403040-00007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15901198/,economics

"Teledermatology offers a means of providing specialist care to underserved patients. The objectives of this study were to compare the costs of interactive teledermatology with conventional care, and to evaluate from a healthcare provider perspective whether interactive teledermatology is economically viable in the northeastern region of the United States. We studied the interactive teledermatology practice at Nantucket Cottage Hospital on Nantucket Island and the ambulatory clinics at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The cost-minimization analysis compared the costs of an interactive teledermatology practice with that of a face-to-face dermatology clinic. One-way sensitivity analyses examined the effect of varying the costs of technology, physician compensation, or clinic space on the overall cost of interactive teledermatology. We also assessed the economic viability of the interactive teledermatology practice by comparing the operating costs with reimbursements. The total hourly operating costs for the interactive teledermatology practice on Nantucket Island and the face-to-face clinic in Boston were $274 and $346, respectively. Three separate one-way sensitivity analyses showed that, for the cost of the teledermatology practice to equal that of the conventional clinic, the cost of teledermatology technology could increase by 9.3-fold, dermatologists working at the teledermatology practice could be compensated up to $197 an hour, or the cost of teledermatology clinic space could reach $57 an hour. Our analysis also showed that the hourly reimbursement for the teledermatology practice was $487, which exceeded its hourly operating cost of $274. The cost of operating an interactive teledermatology practice in a remote region may be less than that of a conventional clinic in a nearby urban center in the northeastern area of the United States. From a healthcare provider perspective, interactive teledermatology can be an economically viable means of providing dermatological care to remote regions.",https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2006.0035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17489695/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The prevalence of severe anaphylaxis, between 1 and 3 per 10,000, has increased sharply over recent years, with a rate of lethality of 1%. The economic burden is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to estimate the economic costs of anaphylaxis, including direct costs of treatment, hospitalization, preventive and long-care measures, and the indirect cost: absenteeism.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Analysis of 402 patients of anaphylaxis declared by 384 allergists was reported to the Allergy Vigilance Network. The global cost was estimated from the national data of hospital admissions: ICD-10 coding available for 2003, 2004 and 2005.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three work/classroom days were lost per patient. Diagnosis required oral challenge with hospitalization in 18% of cases. The estimated mean total cost was 1895 euros for food- and drug-related anaphylaxis (5610 euros for the most severe), and 4053 euros for Hymenoptera anaphylaxis. National statistics recorded 2575 patients in 2005; 22% more than in 2003. The estimated annual cost was 4,789,500 euros. The possible reasons for this being an under-estimate include: data coming only from hospitalized patients, poor identification by medical teams unfamiliar with ICD-10 codes, peri-operative anaphylaxis being insufficiently declared, rush-immunotherapy and maintenance treatments for Hymenoptera anaphylaxis. Similarly, the extra cost of cow milk substitutes, as well as insurance costs where deaths are followed by litigation were not taken into account.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The mean cost of anaphylaxis was 1895-5610 euros in nonfatal patients. The prevalence was under-estimated because of many biases, leading to under-estimation of the national cost. Further studies would be necessary to evaluate the value of preventive strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01513.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18269678/,economics
"The last decade has seen a renewed interest in Sen's capability approach; health economists have been instrumental in leading much of this work. One particular stream of research is the application of the approach to outcome measurement. To date, there have been a dozen attempts (some combined) to operationalise the approach, and produce an outcome measure that offers a broader evaluative space than health-related quality-of-life measures. Applications have so far been confined to public health, physical, mental health and social care interventions, but the capability approach could be of benefit to evaluations of pharmacotherapies and other technologies. This paper provides an introduction to the capability approach, reviews the measures that are available for use in an economic evaluation, including their current applications, and then concludes with a discussion of a number of issues that require further consideration before the approach is adopted more widely to inform resource allocation decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25862464/,economics

"How has funding to developing countries for health improvement changed in the wake of the global financial crisis? The question is vital for policy making, planning, and advocacy purposes in donor and recipient countries alike. We measured the total amount of financial and in-kind assistance that flowed from both public and private channels to improve health in developing countries during the period 1990-2011. The data for the years 1990-2009 reflect disbursements, while the numbers for 2010 and 2011 are preliminary estimates. Development assistance for health continued to grow in 2011, but the rate of growth was low. We estimate that assistance for health grew by 4 percent each year from 2009 to 2011, reaching a total of $27.73 billion. This growth was largely driven by the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and appeared to be a deliberate strategy in response to the global economic crisis. Assistance for health from bilateral agencies grew by only 4 percent, or $444.08 million, largely because the United States slowed its development assistance for health. Health funding through UN agencies stagnated, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria announced that it would make no new grants for the next two years because of declines in funding. Given the international community's focus on meeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and persistent economic hardship in donor countries, continued measurement of development assistance for health is essential for policy making.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.1154,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22174301/,economics
"Augmented by public programs such as Social Security and Medicare, incomes of the elderly in the United States have grown more rapidly during the last several decades than have the incomes of other groups, so that on average the elderly are at least as well off as the nonelderly. Not all elderly, however, have done as well: widows, in particular, have high poverty rates. The economic prospects of the elderly during the next few decades are good because of the large work force from the baby-boom cohort. In the distant future a large fraction of the population will be elderly, which will probably lead to a deterioration in their economic status. Today, the main problems center on the distribution of economic resources among the elderly and on uncertainties such as costs of medical care.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.2655090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2655090/,economics
"The Labour government has outlined its plans to 'replace' the competitive internal market with a more collaborative system based on partnership. Agreement amongst purchasers and providers is to be based on co-operation rather than competition. Longer term agreements covering periods of 3-5 years are to replace annual contracts within this new environment. The aim of this paper is to explore the potential economic implications of these policy changes by drawing on the economics of co-operation and the transaction costs approach to longer term contracting. Issues surrounding the role of trust in contractual relationships are explored and the relevance of experience and evidence from non-health care sectors is considered in the context of the NHS. It is concluded that both theory and empirical evidence suggest that co-operation and trust can play a central role in the efficient organisation of contractual arrangements in circumstances similar to those under which the NHS operates. However, we warn against the expectation that the policy changes will produce automatically the scale of benefits predicted by the Labour government, especially as they will have to find a way of extracting reasonable performance from providers under a system of collaboration and long term agreements. They may find they need to tread a fine line between competition and co-operation in order to reap the benefits of both.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199803)7:2<105::aid-hec333>3.0.co;2-k,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9565167/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      In the context of the current crisis, sustainability of National Health Service must be considered a priority issue. To compare several cost saving measures in drug expenditure due to outpatient drug treatment after surgery in an Ambulatory Surgical Centre.
    


          Material and method:
        
      
      Pharmaco-economic analysis of cost minimization of ambulatory pharmaceutical services during the year 2011. A total of 3,346 patients were operated on and discharged on the same day, were included. Treatments were collected from the discharge report of each patient. We compared changes in real outpatient drug spending after separately applying each of the following measures: 1) increasing the co-payment; 2) improving the quality of prescribing; 3) dispensing by units of drugs through pharmacies, and 4) dispensing through the hospital pharmacy service.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The real outpatient pharmaceutical expenditure was 29,454.21€. Increasing the co-payment mean a transfer of 2,091.82€ from the funding institutions to users. Improving the quality of prescriptions, dispensing through units of drugs in the pharmacy, and dispensing through the hospital pharmacy service led to a pharmaceutical expenditure of 24,215.14€, 21,766.24€ and 7,827.71€, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Only considering co-payment to contain pharmaceutical expenditure arising from prescribing in an Ambulatory Surgical Centre is the least effective measure. The most effective measure, for this purpose, is the supply of drugs through the hospital pharmacy service.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2013.04.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23810401/,economics
"The economic evaluation of alternative diagnostic and therapeutic interventions is not merely a help to the processes by which decision makers allocate scarce economic resources, it is an essential ingredient into those rationing processes. Clinicians and other decision makers who advocate the use of effectiveness data alone to determine who will be treated and who will be left in pain and discomfort may perpetuate the inefficient use of resources. Rationing, or resource allocation, in health care must be informed by knowledge of the costs and consequences (effects) or alternative interventions. To ignore the economic element in clinical choices, generates inefficiency, and therefore unethical practice. The great advantage of the economic approach to rationing is that it requires an explicit framework which identifies the costs and benefits of alternative actions in all domains of human action. The combination of explicitness and precision inherent in good economic evaluation can only help in the difficult task of producing further health benefits for patients from the limited resources of the NHS.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a073000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8556294/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Despite the advantages of modern wound management, it is still employed too rarely because of higher costs and lack of information available to the medical staff. At the University Hospital Jena, the assortment of hydroactive wound dressings has been optimized, in order to increase acceptance and attain cost advantages.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The defined target sizes were differentiated according to economic and qualitative parameters. The economic parameters included the reduction in the total costs for wound management, adjusted for the case mix and the number of cases. Among the qualitative parameters were reducing the number of suppliers and the number of orders outside the standard offerings.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Via standardization, the average expenses per case for hydroactive wound applications could be reduced by 10.3% and the average expenses per weighted German DRG by 15.9%. As a result of the reorganization of the assortment, the number of suppliers was reduced by 57.1% and two main and one secondary supplier were designated. The number of orders outside the standard assortment was reduced from 173 to 21 (87.8%).
    


          Conclusion:

"In part 1 of this series about problems of financing capital goods the multiple and partly diametric economic effects of financing instruments were presented using the leasing procedure as an example. The result indicated that due to the complexity of these effects the choice of a specific financing instrument requires an individual consideration. Therefore, part 2 of the series introduces the method of dynamic capital budgeting which allows the instruments discussed in part 1 to be compared with each other and helps to evaluate their economic benefits. More precisely this paper focuses on a comparative analysis of the most common alternatives, leasing, credit financing and investment financing by the state. In this context, after having identified the total costs of ownership of anesthesia devices, the final asset values of the three financing instruments can be compared with each other using the method of dynamic capital budgeting. In contrast to the prevailing opinion, the results show that from a purely fiscal perspective leasing anesthesia devices is the most expensive alternative. Given the fact that no financial support is available from the state, the option of credit financing turns out to be the most preferable alternative from a relatively limited pool of possibilities. However, it still remains to be answered whether credit financing can defend this position against further, innovative forms of debt financing (e.g., factoring, asset-backed securities, hedge funds, mezzanine capital, etc.).",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-008-1403-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18566782/,economics

We studied 3,066 First Chicago NBD employees by using health risk appraisals and personnel data. Analysis was completed for those employees with and without a risk for BMI. People at risk for BMI are more likely to have additional health risks, short-term disability and illness absence, and higher health care costs than those not at risk for BMI. A ""J-shaped"" curve between health care costs and BMI exists, with the low point occurring at about 25 to 27 kg/m2.

"Diabetic nephropathy is the most frequent cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD). As ESRD incidence increases continuously, more resources are needed for treatment. The objective was to evaluate the economic impact of losartan added to the standard care administered to diabetic subjects with ESRD. The analysis has involved more than 500 million inhabitants. Standard methods have been used in order to conduct an economic evaluation comparing the economic outcomes deriving from the administration of losartan added to standard care versus standard care alone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and nephropathy over 3.4 years. The study was hence conducted from the perspective of the third-party payer. The clinical outcome data were based on the results from the Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial. Direct medical costs are referred to the purchase costs of losartan and to the costs of hospitalization. The costs were discounted back at an annual rate of 3%. Also sensitivity analysis was performed. The RENAAL study showed that losartan confers strong renal protection in patients with DM and nephropathy. Losartan results into cost saving in all countries considered: 3,602.98€/Italy, 4,531.35€/France, 3,019.66€/Germany, 3,949.50€/Switzer-land, and 3,855.50€/US per patient.

"Purpose:
        
      
      Medication error is a significant source of morbidity and mortality among patients. Clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence are required for the implementation of quality of care interventions. Reduction of error-related cost is a key potential benefit of interventions addressing medication error. The aim of this review was to describe and quantify the economic burden associated with medication error.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL, EconLit, ABI/INFORM, Business Source Complete were searched. Studies published 2004-2016 assessing the economic impact of medication error were included. Cost values were expressed in Euro 2015. A narrative synthesis was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 4572 articles were identified from database searching, and 16 were included in the review. One study met all applicable quality criteria. Fifteen studies expressed economic impact in monetary terms. Mean cost per error per study ranged from €2.58 to €111 727.08. Healthcare costs were used to measure economic impact in 15 of the included studies with one study measuring litigation costs. Four studies included costs incurred in primary care with the remaining 12 measuring hospital costs. Five studies looked at general medication error in a general population with 11 studies reporting the economic impact of an individual type of medication error or error within a specific patient population.

"Policy-makers in industrialized countries face the dilemma of having to contain soaring hospital costs while resisting any reduction in the quality and quantity of hospital services. Among the many hospital financing systems, centralized control via global budgeting is advocated by some to be the most effective in containing hospital costs. Containing hospital costs, however, is but one aspect of the trade-off between cost containment and quality of care. The hospital financing system of Hong Kong provides some insights into the extent to which cost control can be achieved through global budgeting; and its impact on the accessibility of hospital care. The case of Hong Kong highlights three necessary conditions for effective cost control: (1) the payer must have a clear policy stance on overall public spending; (2) the payer must have a clear policy stance on the importance of hospital care relative to other goods and services; and (3) the payer must also have the will and ability to limit hospital spending within finalized global budgets. However, successful cost containment in Hong Kong affects the accessibility of hospital care. In a time of population growth and economic prosperity, new community needs seem to have preceded government plans and actions to build hospital facilities.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(92)90100-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1411686/,economics
"In contemporary global health and development discourses, contraception is cast in multiple roles: an antipoverty tool at the household level, a tool of economic development at the national level, a smart investment with net gains, a means of empowering women, a way of lowering maternal mortality ratios. In order to examine such discursive uses of contraception - and their implications for women - in a concrete way, I use a compelling case of the history of the promotion of planned families in Nepal and a recent social and behavior change communication contraception campaign designed in the US. Using social text analysis to examine this multi-year, multi-platform campaign in Nepal, I found that the advertisements present idealized images of ""smart couples:"" progressive, middle-class families engaged in rationalistic family planning to delay and space their offspring. A major theme identified, aspirations to be middle class, links these specific family planning behaviors to upward economic mobility. The small-family ideal previously promoted in the global South had outlived its relevance as Nepal and other countries reached near replacement-level fertility rates. The gradual historical refashioning in Nepal of a discourse that promotes the ""small family"" to one that promotes the modern ""smart couple"" is an illustrative example of the global trend in which a message of replacement-level fertility is repackaged as a message of delaying and spacing births under the guise of health, as funding agencies promote contraceptive adoption as a women's health issue. Underlying this discursive repackaging, however, is a continued economization of life and health.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.05.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31113652/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      A recurring discussion in the literature relates to the possible contradictions among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The focus has been on economic goals, such as economic growth and goals related to climate change. We explore the possible contradictions that may arise between economic goals and health goals, specifically, the goal on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) - SDG3.4. As a way to achieve SDG3.4, countries have been urged to introduce sin taxes, such as those on sugar. Yet others have argued that such taxes may affect employment (SDG 8.5), economic growth (SDG 8.1), and increase poverty (SDG1). However, there is limited or no reliable evidence, using actual experience, on the effect of sugar tax on health and economic outcomes. This makes it hard to assess the possible contradictions in SDGs that sugar taxes may generate.
    


          Main body:
        
      
      Using a conceptual framework on SDGs that views relationships among SDGs as either contradictory, reinforcing, or neutral, we carefully consider whether there are contradictions between SDG 3.4 on one hand and SDG 1, SDG 8.1, and SDG 8.5 on the other hand. We illustrate this using Zambia which recently introduced an equivalent 3% tax on non-alcoholic beverages, implicitly targeted at sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), given the stated goal of reducing NCDs. Concerns are that such a tax would be detrimental to the Zambia sugar value chain which contributes about 6% to GDP, in which case the achievement of SDG 3.4 (health) would be at odds with, or contradict, SDG 1, SDG 8.1, and SDG 8.5 (poverty eradication, economic growth, and creation of employment). We discuss that the existence of contradictions depend on a number of contextual factors, which allows us to make two conclusions about sugar taxation in Zambia. First, the current tax rate of 3% is likely neutral (no contradictions or reinforcing relationships) because it is too low to have any health or employment effects. However, the revenue raised can be reinvested to improve livelihoods. Secondly, the tax rate should be increased but care has to be exercised to ensure that the rate is not too high to generate contradictions. There will be need to carefully assess important parameters such as elasticities and explore alternative economic livelihoods.
    


          Conclusion:

"Since the late 1960s the U.S. has attempted to develop a strategy for controlling the rate of growth of health care spending. During the 1970s this strategy relied heavily on various forms of regulation. Some regulatory programs were partially successful in moderating spending increases, but they generated significant opposition--particularly from powerful provider groups, who successfully convinced Congress and the states to dismantle most of the regulatory structure and to substitute various forms of competitive approaches to controlling spending. Some of these competitive strategies have been successful in increasing the efficiency of subsections of our health system. But they too have produced ""losers,"" and the government has been pressured to enter the system to minimize their losses. The net result has been a political stalemate between halfway competitive markets and ineffective regulation. With the rate of health care spending growth near historic levels, it is likely that the 1990s will bring a return to a stronger role for government regulation. But it is unlikely that we are any more willing to tolerate the negative fallout from regulation today than we were in the 1970s, and therefore we predict that the proportion of GNP going to health care will continue to grow throughout the remainder of this century.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-13-2-323,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3133405/,economics
"Prospective reimbursement (PR) programs were implemented in a number of states in the 1970s to reduce the rate of inflation in hospital costs. The associated savings have prompted concern about whether hospital administrators have been able to economize in ways that do not compromise patient care. This study examined the effects of PR on hospital mortality in 15 states. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the 10-year trend in standardized mortality rates in hospitals in these states with those in a national sample of hospitals not receiving PR. Although the introduction of PR was associated with higher mortality on all patient groups studied, there was no indication that the level of cost saving in states under PR was correlated with patterns of mortality rates. We conclude that policymakers must be concerned that PR may be compromising the quality of patient care in hospitals, and that more definitive research is needed to improve understanding of the implied trade-off between cost containment and patient outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-198907000-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2747304/,economics
"Policy Points: Per-capita household health spending was higher in economically developed states and was associated with ability to pay, but catastrophic health spending (CHS) was equally high in both poorer and more developed states in India. Based on multilevel modeling, we found that the largest geographic variation in health spending and CHS was at the state and village levels, reflecting wide inequality in the accessibility to and cost of health care at these levels. Contextual factors at macro and micro political units are important to reduce health spending and CHS in India.
    


          Context:
        
      
      In India, health care is a local good, and households are the major source of financing it. Earlier studies have examined diverse determinants of health care spending, but no attempt has been made to understand the geographical variation in household and catastrophic health spending. We used multilevel modeling to assess the relative importance of villages, districts, and states to health spending in India.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used data on the health expenditures of 101,576 households collected in the consumption expenditure schedule (68th round) carried out by the National Sample Survey in 2011-2012. We examined 4 dependent variables: per-capita health spending (PHS), per-capita institutional health spending (PIHS), per-capita noninstitutional health spending (PNHS), and catastrophic health spending (CHS). CHS was defined as household health spending exceeding 40% of its capacity to pay. We used multilevel linear regression and logistic models to decompose the variation in each outcome by state, region, district, village, and household levels.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The average PHS was 1,331 Indian rupees (INR), which varied by state-level economic development. About one-fourth of Indian households incurred CHS, which was equally high in both the economically developed and poorer states. After controlling for household level factors, 77.1% of the total variation in PHS was attributable to households, 10.1% to states, 9.5% to villages, 2.6% to districts, and 0.7% to regions. The pattern in variance partitioning was similar for PNHS. The largest interstate variation was found for CHS (15.9%), while the opposite was true for PIHS (3.2%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We observed substantial variations in household health spending at the state and village levels compared with India's districts and regions. The large variation in CHS attributable to states indicates interstate inequality in the accessibility to and cost of health care. Our findings suggest that contextual factors at the macro and micro political units are important to reduce India's household health spending and CHS.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12315,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29504205/,economics

"Using data from the American Hospital Association and the Medicare program, the authors analyzed the effects of financial pressure and market competition on changes in several measures of performance of 1,435 acute care hospitals between 1987 and 1989. Over the observation period, the least profitable hospitals constrained their growth in total expenses to half that for the most profitable hospitals (13.3% versus 27.6%) by limiting the growth of their staffs and their total assets. These changes were associated with a reduction in inefficiency of 1.8% (11.2%) compared with a very slight increase in inefficiency for the highest profit group. Similarly, hospitals in highly competitive markets controlled expenses relative to those in the least competitive areas. However, they also experienced slower revenue growth than did less competitive hospitals so that, in relative terms, their profit rates fell. The authors found no evidence to suggest that financial pressures created by either low profits or market competition resulted in hospitals engaging in cost-shifting. The authors conclude that health care reforms or market forces that put financial pressures on hospitals can result in cost-containment and improved efficiency without significant cost-shifting.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-199603000-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8628041/,economics

"Calculating the cost of an emergency medical services (EMS) system using a standardized method is important for determining the value of EMS. This article describes the development of a methodology for calculating the cost of an EMS system to its community. This includes a tool for calculating the cost of EMS (the ""cost workbook"") and detailed directions for determining cost (the ""cost guide""). The 12-step process that was developed is consistent with current theories of health economics, applicable to prehospital care, flexible enough to be used in varying sizes and types of EMS systems, and comprehensive enough to provide meaningful conclusions. It was developed by an expert panel (the EMS Cost Analysis Project [EMSCAP] investigator team) in an iterative process that included pilot testing the process in three diverse communities. The iterative process allowed ongoing modification of the toolkit during the development phase, based upon direct, practical, ongoing interaction with the EMS systems that were using the toolkit. The resulting methodology estimates EMS system costs within a user-defined community, allowing either the number of patients treated or the estimated number of lives saved by EMS to be assessed in light of the cost of those efforts. Much controversy exists about the cost of EMS and whether the resources spent for this purpose are justified. However, the existence of a validated toolkit that provides a standardized process will allow meaningful assessments and comparisons to be made and will supply objective information to inform EMS and community officials who are tasked with determining the utilization of scarce societal resources.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2011.01277.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22288824/,economics

However, using the expert-based approach, costs were established to be EUR 923 lower.

"To curb a rapid increase in expenditures for pharmaceuticals, the Korean government introduced a positive list system and a negotiation process for drug prices at the end of 2006. Economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals has begun to have a pivotal role in the listing and pricing of drugs for the Korean National Health Insurance. There are some points to discuss regarding the use of economic evaluation in the listing and pricing in the context of the Korean system. First, the listing and pricing processes have been fragmented, evoking complaints from pharmaceutical companies and delaying the access of new drugs to patients. Second, there is a concern that the positive list system may limit the range and availability of drugs for patients to choose for treatment. Third, the time schedule for de-listing of existing drugs may not be realistic. Fourth, it is not always easy to provide reliable evidence of cost-effectiveness due to a lack of materials. Fifth, there is no consensus on the range of the ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) acceptable to the Korean society.

"The 1989 reforms of the UK National Health Service (NHS) introduced competition in the supply of hospital services. This paper synthesizes both the theory underlying the introduction of competition into the NHS, and the limited existing evidence on whether competition affects the prices posted by sellers of medical services, and the costs of producing these services. The results indicate high levels of price variability, widespread disregard for average cost pricing rules and some indication that competition had some effect on prices. It appears that lower prices may be offered to smaller purchasers, such as General Practice Fund Holders (GPFH). This effect of competition on price was mirrored, with a delay, in hospital costs.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199805)7:3<187::aid-hec349>3.0.co;2-f,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9639333/,economics
"Australia is one of the healthiest countries in the world, although we have a long way to go before the health of Indigenous Australians matches that of the population as a whole. In 1999-2000, the Commonwealth Government spent 8.5% of GDP on healthcare, ranking our health spending among the highest in the world. By contrast, many people living in our region are burdened by emerging epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS, diseases associated with economic and industrial development, and problems of communicable disease and nutritional deficiencies. For decades, many Australians have been working towards improving health in these developing countries by providing their knowledge and expertise. While the financial resources for healthcare are largely the responsibility of individual national governments, the international system plays an important role in assisting developing countries to improve their health standards. From our own experiences of working with AusAID and the World Health Organization on two projects to eradicate iodine-deficiency disorders in China and Tibet, we illustrate how health professionals can work with international aid agencies to deliver healthcare and make a difference to the lives of people in developing countries.",https://doi.org/10.5694/j.1326-5377.2003.tb05032.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12492383/,economics
"The increasing proportion of elderly persons presents one of the most urgent problems to European societies and has a decisive effect on social insurance systems. Costs are rising rapidly due to longer life and the falling number of births. Health care is especially hard-hit because of medical progress and growing numbers of procedures during old age. Despite these problems, the German health care system is still effective. In contrast to neighboring European states, there are neither waiting lists nor rationing of services. With respect to financing, future developments cannot be predicted. Planning scenarios taking enormously higher costs into account often result in demands for rationing, which the German health insurance companies do not accept. This study examines economic figures from the largest German health insurer and attempts to draw a picture of future health care for old people. New possibilities for prevention and resourcing and the need for rationing are discussed. The first, promising projects in these respects have already been started, with the aim of better health and quality of life for the elderly.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00104-004-0973-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15551007/,economics
"Managed care organizations often cannot be easily differentiated on the basis of organizational characteristics. Even the provider networks that competing health plans use may be virtually identical in response to employee pressure for broad provider choice. In markets with many undifferentiated networks, current approaches to quality improvement may be more intrusive than helpful. Health plans should delegate quality improvement activities to constituent provider groups and need to explore collaborative approaches to quality improvement. Although many are uncomfortable with using financial incentives to influence professional behavior, the use of capitation to restrain costs is inevitable. Instead of arbitrarily limiting financial incentives, consumers should be protected in market-compatible ways. In particular, expansive disclosure requirements and risk adjustment of both premiums and capitation payments are recommended as approaches that will reward high-quality care.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.16.2.171,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9086666/,economics
"Federal policies have a significant effect on how businesses spend money. The 2009 HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act) authorized incentive payments through Medicare and Medicaid to clinicians and hospitals when they use certified electronic health records privately and securely to achieve specified improvements in care delivery. Federal incentive payments were offered in 2011 for hospitals that had satisfied ""meaningful use"" criteria. A longitudinal study of nonfederal hospital information technology (IT) budgets (N = 493) during the years 2009 to 2011 found increases in the percentage of hospital annual operating budgets allocated to IT in the years leading up to these federal incentives. This increase was most pronounced among hospitals receiving high proportions of their reimbursements from Medicaid, followed by hospitals receiving high proportions of their reimbursements from Medicare, possibly indicating a budget shift during this period to more IT spending to achieve meaningful-use policy guidelines.",https://doi.org/10.1097/hcm.0000000000000055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25909404/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Anesthesia management is characterized by salary limiting and pressure for decreasing anesthetics and other drug budget. The aim of this paper is to determine the possibility of reducing the direct costs in anesthesia.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This paper is a part ofa five-year (2005-2009), academic, pharmaco-economic retrospective- prospective study (phase IV). The study was done according to European Union Directive for Clinical Research. We retrospectively calculated and analyzed all anesthesia direct costs (personnel costs, anesthetics and other drug costs, materials, laboratory analyses, and machines) at the Institute For Ane- sthesia and Reanimation, Clinical Center of Serbia in relation to the costs refunded by National Health Insurance in all patients who underwent anesthesia in 2006.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of 70 195 anesthesia services rendered to 32 267 patients in one-year period, 47% were general anesthesia, 23% were local anesthesia, and 30% were anesthetic procedures. Our results of highly significant association between personnel costs (r = 0.980, p = 0.000) and consumption of anesthetics and drugs (r = 0.885, p = 0.000) with the direct costs do not provide an opportunity for further cost reduction due to disassociation of direct costs and the ""unit price"" of National Health Insurance issued in terms of the restricted maximum budget for health.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is no space for direct cost reduction in anesthesia.",https://doi.org/10.2298/mpns1210421m,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23214337/,economics
"Productivity costs occur when the productivity of individuals is affected by illness, treatment, disability or premature death. The objective of this paper was to review past and current developments related to the inclusion, identification, measurement and valuation of productivity costs in economic evaluations. The main debates in the theory and practice of economic evaluations of health technologies described in this review have centred on the questions of whether and how to include productivity costs, especially productivity costs related to paid work. The past few decades have seen important progress in this area. There are important sources of productivity costs other than absenteeism (e.g. presenteeism and multiplier effects in co-workers), but their exact influence on costs remains unclear. Different measurement instruments have been developed over the years, but which instrument provides the most accurate estimates has not been established. Several valuation approaches have been proposed. While empirical research suggests that productivity costs are best included in the cost side of the cost-effectiveness ratio, the jury is still out regarding whether the human capital approach or the friction cost approach is the most appropriate valuation method to do so. Despite the progress and the substantial amount of scientific research, a consensus has not been reached on either the inclusion of productivity costs in economic evaluations or the methods used to produce productivity cost estimates. Such a lack of consensus has likely contributed to ignoring productivity costs in actual economic evaluations and is reflected in variations in national health economic guidelines. Further research is needed to lessen the controversy regarding the estimation of health-related productivity costs. More standardization would increase the comparability and credibility of economic evaluations taking a societal perspective.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-013-0056-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23620213/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      Due to extended application of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic screening (PGx) tests it is important to assess whether they provide good value for money. This review provides an update of the literature.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was performed in PubMed and papers published between August 2010 and September 2014, investigating the cost-effectiveness of PGx screening tests, were included. Papers from 2000 until July 2010 were included via two previous systematic reviews. Studies' overall quality was assessed with the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found 38 studies, which combined with the previous 42 studies resulted in a total of 80 included studies. An average QHES score of 76 was found. Since 2010, more studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Most recent studies performed cost-utility analysis, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and discussed limitations of their economic evaluations. Most studies indicated favorable cost-effectiveness. Majority of evaluations did not provide information regarding the intrinsic value of the PGx test. There were considerable differences in the costs for PGx testing. Reporting of the direction and magnitude of bias on the cost-effectiveness estimates as well as motivation for the chosen economic model and perspective were frequently missing.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Application of PGx tests was mostly found to be a cost-effective or cost-saving strategy. We found that only the minority of recent pharmacoeconomic evaluations assessed the intrinsic value of the PGx tests. There was an increase in the number of studies and in the reporting of quality associated characteristics. To improve future evaluations, scenario analysis including a broad range of PGx tests costs and equal costs of comparator drugs to assess the intrinsic value of the PGx tests, are recommended. In addition, robust clinical evidence regarding PGx tests' efficacy remains of utmost importance.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146262,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26752539/,economics
"Context:
        
      
      Length of stay data are increasingly used to monitor ICU economic performance. How such material is presented greatly affects its utility.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To develop a weighted length of stay index and to estimate expected length of stay. To assess alternative ways to summarize weighted length of stay to evaluate ICU economic performance.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Retrospective database study.
    


          Subjects:
        
      
      Data for 751 ICU patients in 1998 at two hospitals used to develop weighted length of stay index. Data on 42,237 patients from 72 ICUs used as the basis of economic performance evaluation.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Difference between actual and expected weighted length of stay, where expected weighted length of stay is based on patient clinical characteristics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Length of stay statistically explains approximately 85 to 90% of interpatient variation in hospital costs. The first ICU day is approximately four times as expensive, and other ICU days approximately 2.5 times as expensive, as non-ICU hospital days. In a regression model for weighted length of stay, patient clinical characteristics explain 26% of variation. ICU economic performance can be measured by excess weighted length of stay of a ""typical"" patient or by occurrence of long excess weighted lengths of stay. Although different summary measures of performance are highly correlated, choice of measure affects relative ranking of some ICUs' performance.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Providers of statistical data on ICU economic performance should adjust length of stay for patient characteristics and provide multiple summary measures of the statistical distribution, including measures that address both the typical patient and outliers.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.mlr.0000053021.93198.96,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12618642/,economics
"South Africa is considering introducing a universal health care system. A key concern for policy-makers and the general public is whether or not this reform is affordable. Modelling the resource and revenue generation requirements of alternative reform options is critical to inform decision-making. This paper considers three reform scenarios: universal coverage funded by increased allocations to health from general tax and additional dedicated taxes; an alternative reform option of extending private health insurance coverage to all formal sector workers and their dependents with the remainder using tax-funded services; and maintaining the status quo. Each scenario was modelled over a 15-year period using a spreadsheet model. Statistical analyses were also undertaken to evaluate the impact of options on the distribution of health care financing burden and benefits from using health services across socio-economic groups. Universal coverage would result in total health care spending levels equivalent to 8.6% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is comparable to current spending levels. It is lower than the status quo option (9.5% of GDP) and far lower than the option of expanding private insurance cover (over 13% of GDP). However, public funding of health services would have to increase substantially. Despite this, universal coverage would result in the most progressive financing system if the additional public funding requirements are generated through a surcharge on taxable income (but not if VAT is increased). The extended private insurance scheme option would be the least progressive and would impose a very high payment burden; total health care payments on average would be 10.7% of household consumption expenditure compared with the universal coverage (6.7%) and status quo (7.5%) options. The least pro-rich distribution of service benefits would be achieved under universal coverage. Universal coverage is affordable and would promote health system equity, but needs careful design to ensure its long-term sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czs003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22388495/,economics
The catastrophic health insurance bills introduced during the 96th U.S. Congress failed to consider the current role that Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's) play in providing catastrophic protection and the potential negative impact such legislation may have on their competitive position. This article demonstrates that HMO's are providing this coverage by using the simulated health care expenditures for families in one HMO. The estimated proportion of families that incur catastrophic expenditures varies from 0.3 to 14.4% depending on the definition used for catastrophic.

"A great advantage of the stated preference discrete choice experiment (SPDCE) approach to economic evaluation methodology is its immense flexibility within applied cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). However, while the use of SPDCEs in healthcare has increased markedly in recent years there has been a distinct lack of equivalent CBAs in healthcare using such SPDCE-derived valuations. This article outlines specific issues and some practical suggestions for consideration relevant to the development of CBAs using SPDCE-derived benefits. The article shows that SPDCE-derived CBA can adopt recent developments in cost-effectiveness methodology including the cost-effectiveness plane, appropriate consideration of uncertainty, the net-benefit framework and probabilistic sensitivity analysis methods, while maintaining the theoretical advantage of the SPDCE approach. The concept of a cost-benefit plane is no different in principle to the cost-effectiveness plane and can be a useful tool for reporting and presenting the results of CBAs.However, there are many challenging issues to address for the advancement of CBA methodology using SPCDEs within healthcare. Particular areas for development include the importance of accounting for uncertainty in SPDCE-derived willingness-to-pay values, the methodology of SPDCEs in clinical trial settings and economic models, measurement issues pertinent to using SPDCEs specifically in healthcare, and the importance of issues such as consideration of the dynamic nature of healthcare and the resulting impact this has on the validity of attribute definitions and context.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200624090-00004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16942121/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The introduction of Canada's Medicare in 1966 established precedence for a universally accessible and equitable healthcare system. Although Canada has been a leader in building the foundations of socialized medicine, it has stalled short of fulfilling a vision promulgated by its architects of a system that operates on a continuum of care. The aim of this review was to examine whether the expansion of publicly funded services under the Canada Health Act would be an economically and socially viable policy option.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A literature review of the direct and indirect social and economic costs associated with contracting out community-based services in the form of outpatient rehabilitative care, palliative care, and home care was conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This article concludes that the private financing of community-based services increases healthcare costs in the long term through increased density and frequency of acute care utilization. It is associated with increased indirect costs in the form of caregiver burden and reduced labor market participation of informal caregivers. The expansion of publicly funded community-based services minimizes these direct health and indirect societal costs.
    


          Significance of results:

"The uncertain need for long-term care services is a risk best protected by insurance. However, the current funding relies heavily on personal payment and public welfare, and only lightly on social and private insurances. This method, akin to sitting on a two-legged stool, is unlikely to be sustainable. To incorporate insurance as a key component of funding and to mobilize public and private resources more effectively, we propose a three-legged-stool funding model under which social insurance would provide a basic protection, to be supplemented by private insurance and personal payment. When these sources do not provide sufficient protection for some individuals, Medicaid as public welfare would serve as a safety net. This article (a) discusses how to implement this funding model by using the trade-off principle in both the public and private sectors when resources for long-term care are scarce, and (b) analyzes several objections to this model from cognitive psychology/behavioral economics",https://doi.org/10.1177/0898264302239013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12611401/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      If Public Health is the science and art of how society collectively aims to improve health, and reduce inequalities in health, then Public Health Economics is the science and art of supporting decision making as to how society can use its available resources to best meet these objectives and minimise opportunity cost. A systematic review of published guidance for the economic evaluation of public health interventions within this broad public policy paradigm was conducted.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Electronic databases and organisation websites were searched using a 22 year time horizon (1990-2012). References of papers were hand searched for additional papers for inclusion. Government reports or peer-reviewed published papers were included if they; referred to the methods of economic evaluation of public health interventions, identified key challenges of conducting economic evaluations of public health interventions or made recommendations for conducting economic evaluations of public health interventions. Guidance was divided into three categories UK guidance, international guidance and observations or guidance provided by individual commentators in the field of public health economics. An assessment of the theoretical frameworks underpinning the guidance was made and served as a rationale for categorising the papers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 5 international guidance documents, 7 UK guidance documents and 4 documents by individual commentators. The papers reviewed identify the main methodological challenges that face analysts when conducting such evaluations. There is a consensus within the guidance that wider social and environmental costs and benefits should be looked at due to the complex nature of public health. This was reflected in the theoretical underpinning as the majority of guidance was categorised as extra-welfarist.

      In this novel review we argue that health economics may have come full circle from its roots in broad public policy economics. We may find it useful to think in this broader paradigm with respect to public health economics. We offer a 12 point checklist to support government, NHS commissioners and individual health economists in their consideration of economic evaluation methodology with respect to the additional challenges of applying health economics to public health.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-1001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24153037/,economics
"Most economic relationships are either arm's-length exchange transactions, each party seeking his or her own interest, or command structures, such as a firm or public agency, integrating joint efforts toward a common goal. The health care industry, however, displays a pattern of incomplete vertical integration--relationships which are neither truly arm's-length nor completely hierarchical. The doctor-patient relationship is archetypical. Physicians appear to sell services in private markets; yet they reach through the exchange process to direct the consumer-patient's utilization decisions, implicity undertaking to act in the patient's interest, and thus integrate forward. But they also integrate backward to control the public regulatory process--self-government--and some forms of insurance. The health care systems of different countries--Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States--can be interpreted as different patterns of incomplete integration among five basic classes of transactors: consumer-patients, first-line providers, second-line providers, insurers, and governments. Each system of linkage has characteristic strengths and weaknesses. Nowhere, however, do we find a predominance of arm's-length market relationships. Where they exist, markets in health care are usually pseudomarkets dominated by one side of the transaction. The rhetoric of market relationships serves principally to obscure political struggles over shifting patterns of integration.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716283468001005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10261430/,economics
"In the selective contracting era, consumer choice has generally been absent in most state Medicaid programs, including California's (called Medi-Cal). In a setting where beneficiary exit is not a threat, a large payer may have both the incentives and the ability to exercise undue market power, potentially exposing an already vulnerable population to further harm. The analyses presented here of Medi-Cal contracting data, however, do not yield compelling evidence in favor of the undue market power hypothesis. Instead, hospital competition appears to explain with greater consistency why certain hospitals choose to contract with Medi-Cal while others do not, the trends in inpatient prices paid by Medi-Cal over time, and the effect of price competition on service cutbacks, such as emergency room closures.",https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.10096,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12722762/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In the United States in 2000, 180,400 new cases of prostate carcinoma were expected to occur, with 31,900 men expected to die from this illness. In addition, prostate carcinoma is the cause of over half a million disability-adjusted life-years. This study summarizes the current body of published literature about the economics of prostate carcinoma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The authors used a MEDLINE-based literature review for relevant articles from 1990 to the present.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The authors' search returned 216 articles, 56 of which met the criteria of interest. Prostate carcinoma is costly to treat, currently averaging above $20,000 per case. Cost of care is directly related to stage of disease and comorbidity. Substantial geographic variation exists, even within small locales, with regard to care patterns and cost. In-hospital mortality, length of stay, and cost are inversely related to case volume. Care rendered in health maintenance organizations is generally less technologically intensive than in the fee-for-service sector. Out of the 18 cost studies examined, 13 were cost-minimization analyses and five assessed cost-effectiveness. From a cost perspective, laparoscopic pelvic node dissection was favored over an open pelvic procedure; 3D conformal radiation therapy was favored over 2D; and radiation therapy was favored over radical prostatectomy. Cost-effectiveness analyses favored the use of metastron, mitroxantone plus prednisone over prednisone alone, flutamine with either medical or surgical castration, and orchiectomy as the androgen suppression therapy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The literature on the economics of prostate carcinoma is relatively meager. Most cost studies were done on small samples, had short follow-up periods, used charges rather than cost data, and did not include adequate representation of all stages of disease.

"Many theoretical and empirical studies have analyzed the relationship between the economic cycle and tobacco consumption using the GDP and unemployment rates as the key variables for measuring economic phases. However, few studies focus on the pathways that cause tobacco consumption to be linked with the economic cycle, and there are no studies analyzing the heterogeneous effects underlying this relationship across nations and regions. This article explores the relationship and its pathways in 16 Spanish regions for the period 1989-2018. To this end, we apply a Granger causality analysis based on the augmented vector autoregressive (VAR) model in levels and extra lags. This method provides more efficient and robust results than the standard VAR model, which can lead to biased results with limited samples, especially in a region-by-region analysis. The empirical results suggest that the impact of the business cycle on tobacco consumption is heterogeneous and specific to each region. In addition, although recession phases cause a decline in tobacco consumption in Spain, in line with the literature, this procyclical relationship does not occur for expansion phases in all regions. One of the main findings of this article is that in expansion phases, tobacco consumption is sensitive to GDP, while in recession phases, tobacco consumption is affected by unemployment. National and regional governments should consider these results when they develop smoking control policies because homogeneous strategies can lead to heterogeneous results. Thus, the results can be useful for policymakers dealing with tobacco control strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-020-09286-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33025350/,economics
"""This paper develops a model of inter vivos gifts and bequests in a setting of moral hazard and adverse selection. Altruistic parents do not perfectly know how much effort their children make to earn their living, nor do they know their true level of ability. Inter vivos gifts take place prior to the realization of the children's earnings whereas at the moment of bequests, parents do observe them.

"Authorities in a number of countries rely increasingly on cost-effectiveness analysis to determine reimbursement status or clinical guidance for pharmaceuticals. This study compared the use of health economic evidence across five reimbursement committees (Australia, Ontario and British Columbia in Canada, Finland, and France) and one clinical guidance committee (England and Wales). Health economic evidence was found to support decision making, although cost-effectiveness is less important in some identifiable situations. Since the relative importance of cost-effectiveness varies, it will be difficult to implement a single explicit threshold. Further research may make patterns of decision making, distributional concerns, and the importance of different criteria more transparent, which would help to narrow the gap between the theory and practice of health economic evaluations. While the use of health economic evidence and the outcome of decision making are similar across committees, there is presently only limited knowledge to what extent prescribing patterns are influenced by decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-003-0195-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15452762/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Each and every hospital of any kind is forced, due to increased cost pressure, to work as economically and as efficiently as possible. This even applies when the operational orientations of the hospitals institutions are different. In the present article an analysis of the repercussions of the treatment of postoperative complications in terms of entrepreneurial practice is given. Our focus is on the opportunity cost.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A theoretical calculation of opportunity costs is made based on the example of postoperative infections following cardiac surgery and the resulting treatment. The bases of the examinations are the results collected at the hospital Mediclin Herzentrum Lahr / Baden in 2008. The wound healing disorders were recorded from November 2004 until November 2007 and include 3675 patients who were operated on using a median sternotomy. Out of the 3675 patients 45 (1.2 %) were affected. Various treatment options are at hand. The used therapy algorithm in our practice is dependent on the stage and the development of the infection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      If the high trim point, the medial trim point and the low trim point of the mediastinitis patients, as well as the average revenue and the surcharge omission on exceeding the high trim point (these data can be found in the annual accounts) and knowledge of the actual length of stay of the mediastinitis patient are known, the opportunity cost, respectively potential turnover increases, can be calculated. Reducing the medial trim point from 48.43 to, for example, 36.37 days could potentially produce a turnover increase of as much as 10 633.41 €.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Keeping patient safety in mind, significant turnover increases can be achieved with adequate planning. The considered sales situation, however, can only be achieved under the same terms: these being free operating room and bed capacities, available personnel, equal cost of materials as well as enough patients. The consideration of opportunity costs could be important for entrepreneurs if staff shortage continues and, in economical terms, non-expendable capacities are created.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1283762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22194084/,economics
"With the introduction of the Prospective Payment System, hospital accountants' role changed from reimbursement maximizers to an important role in decision making. Faced with increased competition, hospitals are installing financial controls. Hospital marketers are also engaging in external promotional and health awareness campaigns and expanding their services to stabilize income and reduce the effects of a changing environment. Thus, hospitals operate in a more competitive environment with increasing uncertainty. When faced with uncertainty, organizations often believe that they must convince society that their existence is legitimate. Increasing specialization and organizational complexity in health care professions have made the expert important. Experts, such as the role assumed by hospital accountants and physicians, maintain power because the organization depends on them for their special skills and information. Marketing should also develop an internal marketing program to reach these power influencers. Scarce resource coupled with uncertainty move hospital accountants as experts into the power equation in the changing control of the U.S. healthcare system. Previously, the physician was the major source of hospital power. Since accountants often serve as monitors of scarce resources, information about the resource allocation directly affects the distribution of power. Marketers should acknowledge that this places hospital accountants in a critical role of assisting their institutions in adapting to a new environment.",https://doi.org/10.1300/j043v10n01_02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10156182/,economics

"Lump sum reimbursement and the resulting concentration of medical treatment in maximum care clinics have led to substantial increase in economic pressure on university hospitals. Nearly all hospitals have introduced business ratios to economically judge each department. In order to evaluate the validity and comparability the business ratios of seven university traumatology departments were evaluated. Structural data as well as cost calculation results in different cost groups were evaluated. Major differences could be identified despite the fact that the cost calculations were all based on the same method (InEK method). In particular the costs for distribution to other medical specialties such as radiology or anesthesiology differed widely. Costs for infrastructure also showed a great variation. Differences in efficiency cannot be the only cause for these discrepancies and lacking standardization of cost calculation methodology is also another major cause. All the business ratios analyzed must be looked at critically and unless a thoroughly standardized methodology of cost calculation is implemented, cost ratios will have a limited potential for hospital benchmarking.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00113-009-1704-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19777198/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Numerous economic models have assessed the cost-effectiveness of antipsychotic medications in schizophrenia. It is important to understand what key impacts of antipsychotic medications were considered in the existing models and limitations of existing models in order to inform the development of future models.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This systematic review aims to identify which clinical benefits, clinical harms, costs and cost savings of antipsychotic medication have been considered by existing models, to assess quality of existing models and to suggest good practice recommendations for future economic models of antipsychotic medications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An electronic search was performed on multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, The NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Health Technology Assessment database) to identify economic models of schizophrenia published between 2005-2020. Two independent reviewers selected studies for inclusion. Study quality was assessed using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) checklist and the Cooper hierarchy. Key impacts of antipsychotic medications considered by exiting models were descriptively summarised.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty models were included. Existing models varied greatly in key impacts of antipsychotic medication included in the model, especially in clinical outcomes used for assessing reduction in psychotic symptoms and types of adverse events considered in the model. Quality of existing models was generally low due to failure to capture the health and cost impact of adverse events of antipsychotic medications and input data not obtained from best available source. Good practices for modelling antipsychotic medications are suggested.

"In this study, we reviewed pharmacoeconomic guidelines from the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Australia, Canada, and the United States to determine areas of emerging standardization. We examined the published literature, publication guidelines of major health journals, and published and unpublished recommendations from various task forces and conferences on related topics. The review revealed several general principles for which there was consensus across guidelines. These common features included the importance of using and reporting transparent methods so that readers can easily understand what calculations are being performed on which data elements, minimizing bias, and providing justification for the methods and assumptions used. Differences were detected across guidelines on the following topics: type of pharmacoeconomic assessment, perspective, comparators and data sources, data analysis, cost analysis, future cost analysis, outcomes assessment, modeling, time horizon, discounting, disclosure, and generalizability. Evolution of economic guidelines hinges on whether the primary goal is to increase the consistency or increase the validity of economic assessments.

"The unsustainable trend of rising healthcare costs necessitates difficult allocation decisions by governments, policymakers, and physicians. Consequently, recent advances in transcatheter valve therapies require not only clinical evaluation, but also careful economic evaluation. Under current indications, each year there are nearly 18,000 new candidates for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in European countries and an additional 9,200 in North America, with an estimated cost of more than $2 billion per year. Nonetheless, when compared with standard medical therapy for severe aortic stenosis (AS), TAVI leads to gains in life expectancy at an incremental cost that is acceptable by most Western standards. On the other hand, for high-risk (but operable) patients with severe AS, TAVI provides no proven survival advantage and only a transient quality of life benefit compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Thus, for these patients, the cost-effectiveness of TAVI compared with SAVR hinges on the magnitude and duration of the quality of life benefit as well as the relative cost of both procedures. Current data suggest that, for patients who are eligible for transfemoral access, TAVI is economically attractive (or even economically dominant) compared with high-risk SAVR. However, the cost-effectiveness of TAVI for patients who are not suitable for a transfemoral approach appears to be less favourable. Transcatheter mitral valve repair is in an earlier stage of clinical implementation than TAVI. As the evidence for this procedure accumulates, more formal economic analysis should be feasible.",https://doi.org/10.4244/eijv9ssa10,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24025958/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to systematically review recent health economic evaluations (HEEs) of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare. The aim was to discuss pertinent methods, reporting quality and challenges for future implementation of AI in healthcare, and additionally advise future HEEs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review was conducted in 2 databases (PubMed and Scopus) for articles published in the last 5 years. Two reviewers performed independent screening, full-text inclusion, data extraction, and appraisal. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards and Philips checklist were used for the quality assessment of included studies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 884 unique studies were identified; 20 were included for full-text review, covering a wide range of medical specialties and care pathway phases. The most commonly evaluated type of AI was automated medical image analysis models (n = 9, 45%). The prevailing health economic analysis was cost minimization (n = 8, 40%) with the costs saved per case as preferred outcome measure. A total of 9 studies (45%) reported model-based HEEs, 4 of which applied a time horizon >1 year. The evidence supporting the chosen analytical methods, assessment of uncertainty, and model structures was underreported. The reporting quality of the articles was moderate as on average studies reported on 66% of Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards items.

"The U.S. health care economy is changing with remarkable speed from the non-competitive guild system of the past 50 years to a competitive market stem. A more efficient industry, more responsive to consumer preferences, is emerging. National health care expenditures grew from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1950 to 10.7 percent in 1983. Three factors that were especially important contributors to this are now being changed. The first is the fee-for-service method of payment of providers. The second is the principle of 'free choice of provider', a medical-economic concept designed to assure that the payor has no bargaining power and that there will be no economic competition among doctors. The third is that most government subsidies were open-ended subsidies of marginal costs. Important changes took place in the early 1980s, and additional changes appear inevitable, that will bring the open-ended era to an end. These changes are setting in motion an accelerating process that seems sure to change the whole system of health care finance from fees for individual items of service reimbursed after the fact, to prospective payments for global units of care, with providers at risk for their use of resources, and from cost-unconscious 'free choice' of provider to cost-conscious choice among limited groups of selected providers contracting in advance. The likely outcome of the process appears to be consolidation of the medical care system into comprehensive health care financing and delivery organizations serving, perhaps, several hundred thousand to several million people each.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(87)90035-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10282264/,economics
"A methodology has been developed to carry out an integrated oil spill vulnerability index, V, for coastal environments. This index takes into account the main physical, biological and socio-economical characteristics by means of three intermediate indexes. Three different integration methods (worst-case, average and survey-based) along with ESI-based vulnerability scores, V(ESI), proposed for the Cantabrian coast during the Prestige oil spill, have been analyzed and compared in terms of agreement between the classifications obtained with each one for this coastal area. Results of this study indicate that the use of the worst-case index, V(R), leads to a conservative ranking, with a very poor discrimination which is not helpful in coastal oil spill risk management. Due to the homogeneity of this coastal stretch, the rest of the methods, V(I), V(M) and V(ESI), provide similar classifications. However, V(M) and V(I) give more flexibility allowing three indexes for each coastal segment and including socio-economic aspects. Finally, the V(I) procedure is proposed here as the more advisable as using this index promotes the public participation that is a key element in the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (IZCM).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.07.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19735972/,economics

As a result of several forces, particularly the scarcity of resources, the retreat of the Welfare State and the introduction of market forces in health care, both values are increasingly under strain. Next to solidarity and equality, freedom of choice and financial responsibility are playing an important role in Dutch health care. Consequently, there is a growing division in Dutch health care between two tiers, one basic tier giving access to a basic package of services and a luxury tier giving access to a higher quality of care and to services not included in the basic package.

"The paper explains the economist's concept of human capital, and uses it to analyse some of the problems raised in the Black Report on inequalities in health. Individuals are assumed to have an optimal 'stock' of health, defined as the level of stock for which the marginal benefits of further investment in the stock falls below its marginal cost. Differences in marginal benefits and costs between individuals will thus lead to differences in their health stocks. Use of this simple model and its associated concepts can be used to help explain, for instance, why social class differences in mortality are steepest in early adulthood and shallowest in the decade before retirement or why manual workers who 'need' more health than non-manual workers are nonetheless in general less healthy. The model can also contribute to the discussion of normative issues, for instance, to refine the concept of equality of access. However, while it has great potential in organising and analysing hypotheses concerning health behaviour, the model is in no way a substitute for other approaches; indeed it only becomes meaningful when interpreted in sociological, epidemiological and medical terms.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(85)90259-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3925561/,economics
"Spain has a reference price system (RPS) for off-patent medicines since 1997. In addition, from 2012, Andalusia is running a series of tenders for procuring off-patent medicines dispensed by community pharmacies, for those medicines included in the system of homogenous clusters within the national reference price system. Such tenders offer additional savings to the regional payer - in the form of rebates (""economic improvements"") from companies winning the tender. This paper estimates that the regional savings were between €43 M to €54 M over the period of study (April - September 2015). The paper also estimates that Spain could have made between 14 and 17 times higher savings than the national reference pricing system savings, had the Andalusian-type tender been implemented at national level over the same period of study. Based on our analysis, we have four remarks. First, the national RPS in Spain is not generating enough price competition for off-patent products dispensed in primary care pharmacies. Second, tenders can be a useful way to generate competition and financial savings in the off-patent market. Third, tenders can lead to discounts offered by medicine providers being redistributed from pharmacies to payers.

"Rural primary care programs were established in areas where there was thought to be no competition for patients. However, evidence from site visits and surveys of a national sample of subsidized programs revealed a pattern of competitive responses by the clinics. In this study of 193 rural primary care programs, mail and telephone surveys produced uniform data on the organization, operation, finances, and utilization of a representative sample of clinics. The programs were found to compete in terms of: (1) price, (2) service mix, (3) staff availability, (4) structural accessibility, (5) outreach, and (6) targeting a segment of the market. The competitive strategies employed by the clinics had consequences that affected their productivity and financial stability. The strategies were related to the perceived missions of the programs, and depended heavily upon the degree of isolation of the program and the targeting of the services. The competitive strategy chosen by a particular program could not be predicted based on service area population and apparent competitors in the service area. The goals and objectives of the programs had more to do with their competitive responses than with market characteristics.

"Background:
        
      
      The introduction of a new methodology for the pricing of drugs by the Agency of Medicines of the Republic of Macedonia for the period 2012 to 2015 resulted in a price reduction of 1386 drugs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This pioneer study evaluated the effects of the price changes during this period of 4 years and the consequent effects on the sale quantities for the segmented Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical groups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The drugs were grouped by the size of the reductions, by segmenting the drugs by generic names, and by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification, in which the quantities are grouped by generic names and the prices are calculated by average values for a period of 1 year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysis of the relations between price changes and quantities sold showed that since the introduction of the new methodology the decrease in the prices pushed down the sales of the drugs.

      This article presents not only the market developments but also projects the tendencies, concluding clearly that focusing only on the price reduction of drugs and not on the implementation of the pharmacoeconomic studies is deviating the supply of drugs that are on the market and affecting their quality. The trends indicate that patients are using old-generation drugs, packaging forms that do not fully answer the market demand, and policies that significantly affect the suppliers. The presented analysis confirms that if the new methodology is only partially implemented and is not followed in full consideration of the pharmacoeconomic studies, negative consequences will also have an impact on regional pharmaceutical markets, which are benchmarking prices of drugs with the Macedonian market.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2016.07.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27881273/,economics
"An economic analysis of biomass power generation was conducted. Two key technologies--direct combustion with a steam turbine and gasification with a syngas engine--were mainly examined. In view of the present domestic biomass infrastructure of Korea, a small and distributed power generation system ranging from 0.5 to 5 MW(e) was considered. It was found that gasification with a syngas engine becomes more economically feasible as the plant size decreases. Changes in the economic feasibilities with and without RPS or heat sales were also investigated. A sensitivity analysis of each system was conducted for representative parameters. Regarding the cost of electricity generation, electrical efficiency and fuel cost significantly affect both direct combustion and gasification systems. Regarding the internal rate of return (IRR), the heat sales price becomes important for obtaining a higher IRR, followed by power generation capacity and electrical efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.07.041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21856151/,economics
"This essay is a historical and epistemological exploration of a traditionally crazy economic event: the financial bubble. Venturing into two different moments in the history of economic thinking, it investigates financial bubbles as epistemic frontiers, where rationality has reached its limits. The first half forays into late twentieth-century economics. Since 1980, an interpretive battle over the ir/rationality of bubbles has made those peculiar events, long beyond the pale of the rational, contested terrain on which the limits of rationality have been fought out. The essay's second half turns to one historical crisis, the South Sea Bubble. For contemporaries in 1720, the bubble was a different kind of epistemic frontier. As they tried to reckon what South Sea Company stock was worth, investors were confronted not with clearly rational or irrational choices but with a decidedly unruly collection of similarly plausible calculations. The story of 1720 suggests that studying historical confusion might be a profitable enterprise for scholars of the economic and epistemological past.",https://doi.org/10.1086/683529,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26685523/,economics

"Prescription and over-the-counter medications are an important and widely used part of healthcare in Canada. Such drugs represent an increasing proportion of total healthcare expenditures. The objectives of the paper are to examine pharmaceutical expenditures and utilisation in Canada, review the major cost control strategies for pharmaceuticals, and discuss the future issues and challenges for pharmaceutical policy in Canada. Compared with other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, Canada (until recently) has not been successful in controlling the rate of increase of healthcare expenditures and, more specifically, pharmaceutical costs. The key variables associated with high rates of increase in drug costs relate to increased per capita use of drugs, use of more expensive drugs, and rising prices of existing drugs. If policies are going to address the fundamental societal issues behind both the price and utilisation elements of pharmaceuticals, policy makers and third-party payers in Canada will probably have to focus, primarily, on manufacturers and major healthcare providers and, secondarily, on consumers. They will need to develop an internally valid package of consistent policies.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199814001-00011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10186485/,economics

"The ongoing federal budget crisis has led to extensive debate over how much money the federal government should spend on scientific research. In the struggle for limited funds, many advocacy groups will covet the large sums proposed for science research, and the scientific community may be called upon to justify its large share of the discretionary funding, especially the large increases for some science agencies and ""big science"" projects. Many would instinctively support the assertion that scientific progress is a cornerstone of national well-being, but the connection between strong federal support of research and vigorous economic growth or societal vitality is not straightforward. Two variables--science and technology, not science alone, are basic to the larger issues of the economy and social welfare. Federal policy must facilitate development in coordination with support for basic science. Scientists, in turn, must help foster a perspective that encompasses research and development as a whole and that seeks to identify explicitly the connections between the nature of the R&D effort and economic vitality and quality of life. Furthermore, society needs a free flow of information between all members of the science and technology community and an end to the artificial and harmful barriers between them. The science community must focus on setting priorities, refining science and technology policy to maximize available resources, and convincing voters that science can make crucial contributions to the long-term welfare of the nation.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-199107000-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2059262/,economics
"In 1994, Canada became the second country to release national guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals. The guidelines were developed over a period of 18 months through an elaborate process of broad consultation with a wide variety of relevant stakeholders. The intent of the guidelines is to provide guidance to doers and users of studies, by laying out the general 'state of the art' regarding methods, and by providing specific methodological advice on many matters. The aim is to improve the scientific quality and integrity of studies, and to enhance consistency and comparability across studies. This article presents the Canadian guidelines, both in summary and in detail. Because the techniques of economic evaluation are widely applicable beyond pharmaceuticals, the guidelines will be of interest to researchers and decision makers in all fields of healthcare. Because the methods are not country specific, the guidelines will be of interest to those in other countries as well as in Canada.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199609060-00008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10160481/,economics
"Health monitoring of world economy is an important issue, especially in a time of profound economic difficulty world-wide. The most important aspect of health monitoring is to accurately predict economic downturns. To gain insights into how economic crises develop, we present two metrics, positive and negative income entropy and distribution analysis, to analyze the collective ""spatial"" and temporal dynamics of companies in nine sectors of the world economy over a 19 year period from 1990-2008. These metrics provide accurate predictive skill with a very low false-positive rate in predicting downturns. The new metrics also provide evidence of phase transition-like behavior prior to the onset of recessions. Such a transition occurs when negative pretax incomes prior to or during economic recessions transition from a thin-tailed exponential distribution to the higher entropy Pareto distribution, and develop even heavier tails than those of the positive pretax incomes. These features propagate from the crisis initiating sector of the economy to other sectors.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025053,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22007270/,economics

"The study explores the causal relationship between monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion in developed and under-developed countries. Structural Vector Auto-regressive techniques have been inducted to explore the relationship between monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion. The study covers the secondary data of 10 developed and 30 underdeveloped countries throughout 2004-2018. It is concluded that monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion do not have a contemporaneous impact on each other. Nevertheless, the reduced-form Vector Auto-regressive witness the reverse causality between financial inclusion and monetary policy effectiveness in developed countries. Thus, effective monetary policy enhances financial inclusion in a country, and a higher degree of financial inclusion lowers the inflation rate and makes monetary policy effective. One way causality from monetary policy effectiveness to financial inclusion can be observed in under-developed countries. Using the Structural Vector auto-regressive technique and financial inclusion index composed of three-dimension to examine the relationship of monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion in developed and developing countries is considered the study's significant contribution.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261337,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936670/,economics

"In 1987, the Dekker committee proposed managed competition as the dominant principle for reforming healthcare in The Netherlands. Considerable progress has been made in implementing the Dekker proposal, such as risk-adjusted capitation of Sick Funds, yearly open enrollment and selective contracting with providers. The centre-right government, which came to power in 2003, plans to implement the final steps in the coming years, which will drastically change pharmaceutical policies and shift power from central government to regional actors in healthcare. The current price reference system, which was initiated in 1991, has failed in containing expenditure or providing incentives towards efficiency. For new drugs, which can not be clustered in the price reference system or for which the producer wants a premium price, a pharmacoeconomic study and budget impact analysis is formally required from 2005 onwards. This fourth hurdle may limit access to new drugs, which contribute considerably to expenditure or for which relative efficiency is above a certain cost-effectiveness threshold. In line with the Dekker principle, insurance companies are expected to step into the market and initiate policies to reduce costs. However, the government seems somewhat reluctant to abandon instruments belonging to old supply-side regulation. Given the current healthcare cost explosion, which coincides with an economic recession, it remains to be seen whether politicians will really shift the power to the insurers and not return to traditional cost-containment policies.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200422002-00007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15660478/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Economic downturn can have a wide range of effects on medicine at both individual and national levels. We aim to describe these effects in relation to surgical volume to guide future planning for physician specialization, patient expectations in the face of economic crises, or estimating healthcare expenditure. We hypothesized that because of high out-of-pocket costs, cosmetic procedure volumes would be most affected by economic decline.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, and ABI/INFORMS. The main search terms were ""economic recession"" and ""surgical procedures, operative"". Studies were included if surgical volumes were measured and economic indicators were used as predictors of economic conditions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve studies were included, and the most common subject was cosmetic (n = 5), followed by orthopedic (n = 2) and cardiac surgeries (n = 2). The majority of studies found that in periods of economic downturn, surgical volume decreased. Among the eight studies using Pearson's correlation analysis, there were no significant differences between cosmetic procedures and other elective procedures, indicating that cosmetic procedures may display trends similar to those of non-cosmetic elective procedures in periods of economic downturn.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Surgical volume generally decreased when economic indicators declined, observed for both elective and non-elective surgery fields. However, a few specific procedure volumes such as vasectomy and caesarean section for male babies increased during the economic downturn. Knowledge of these trends can be useful for future surgical planning and distribution of healthcare resources.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.06.036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28625820/,economics

Economic growth alone would allow 12 of them to reach a level of health spending where their populations could have access to a very basic set of health services.

"New health technologies often yield health benefits, but often at a high cost. In Australia, the processes for public reimbursement of high-cost pharmaceuticals and medical devices are different, potentially resulting in inequity in support for new therapies. We explore how reimbursement is different for medical devices compared with pharmaceuticals, including whether higher cost-effectiveness thresholds are accepted for pharmaceuticals. A literature review identified the challenges of economic evaluations for medical devices compared with pharmaceuticals. We used the ventricular assist device as a case study to highlight specific features of medical device funding in Australia. We used existing guidelines to evaluate whether ventricular assist devices would fulfil the requirements for the ""Life-Saving Drugs Program"", which is usually reserved for expensive life-extending pharmaceutical treatments of serious and rare medical conditions. The challenges in conducting economic evaluations of medical devices include limited data to support effectiveness, device-operator interaction (surgical experience) and incremental innovations (miniaturisation). However, whilst high-cost pharmaceuticals may be funded by a single source (federal government), the funding of high-cost devices is complex and may be funded via a combination of federal, state and private health insurance. Based on the Life-Saving Drugs Program criteria, we found that ventricular assist devices could be funded by a similar mechanism to that which funds high-cost life-extending pharmaceuticals. This article highlights the complexities of medical device reimbursement. Whilst differences in available evidence affect the evaluation process, differences in funding methods contribute to inequitable reimbursement decisions between medical devices and pharmaceuticals.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-019-00470-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30906972/,economics
"The aim of the health outcomes movement is to reorientate health services so that the spotlight shines less on what is done and more on what is achieved. The health outcomes movement, thus far, has been most successful in addressing what appear to be technical questions relating to the measurement and analysis of health outcomes and in placing their routine use on the agenda of clinical practice and health services planning. If there is one lesson to be drawn from an economic perspective, however, it is that health outcomes are about values and not just technicalities. The need to make choices forces one to consider whether what is achieved is also what is most valued. The success of health service delivery, be it at a clinical, planning or systems level, must therefore be measured against agreed objectives. It follows that time must be taken to establish what patients and the community want from their health services and what each is prepared to give up to achieve its ends. Value judgements are unavoidable.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To describe three models of how health insurance coverage can develop for health care goods and services and apply them to pharmacist services. Also, to raise readers' awareness of the costs/tradeoffs involved in receiving third party reimbursements of insurance coverage from a health provider perspective.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Insurance theory and literature.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The three models for developing health insurance coverage are the risk-pooling model, the demand model, and the cost containment model. The risk-pooling model does not apply to coverage for pharmacist services because the cost of such services is not catastrophic and unpredictable. Applying both the demand model and the cost containment model to developing coverage for pharmacist services presents some challenges, but the demand model has been used more successfully to obtain insurance coverage for other health care goods and services. Potential costs and tradeoffs to the health care provider associated with insurance coverage are higher administrative costs, lower reimbursement rates, and loss of professional autonomy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      If pharmacists want to increase third party coverage for their services, the best approach may be to increase patient demand for insurance coverage by promoting and charging for pharmacist services. However, pharmacists should seriously consider whether the benefits of such coverage for their services outweigh the costs.",https://doi.org/10.1331/108658002762063736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12482013/,economics

"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis therapy continues to increase worldwide, and despite technological advances, treatment remains resource intensive. Thus, the increasing burden of dialysis therapy on finite health-care budgets is an important consideration. The principles of allocative efficiency and the concept of 'opportunity cost' can be used to assess whether dialysis is economically justified; if dialysis is to be provided, cost-minimization and cost-utility analyses can be used to identify the most efficient dialysis modality. Existing studies have examined the cost, and where relevant the effectiveness, of the various currently available peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis modalities. In this Review, we discuss variations in the intrinsic costs of the available dialysis modalities as well as other factors, such as variation by country, available health-care infrastructures, the timing of dialysis initiation and renal transplantation.

"Economic theory suggests that medical spending risk affects the extent to which households are willing to accept financial risk, and consequently their investment portfolios. In this study, we focus on the elderly for whom medical spending represents a substantial risk. We exploit the exogenous reduction in prescription drug spending risk because of the introduction of Medicare Part D in the U.S. in 2006 to identify the causal effect of medical spending risk on portfolio choice.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To determine the economic benefit of ""modern"" nonemergency medical transportation (NEMT) that utilizes digital transportation networks compared with traditional NEMT in the United States.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used the National Academies' NEMT cost-effectiveness model to perform a baseline cost savings analysis for provision of NEMT for transportation-disadvantaged Medicaid beneficiaries. On the basis of a review of the literature, commercial information, and structured expert interviews, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the incremental economic benefit of using modern NEMT. We estimated confidence intervals (CIs) by using Monte Carlo simulation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Total annual net savings for traditional NEMT in Medicaid was approximately $4 billion. For modern NEMT, estimated savings on ride costs varied from 30% to 70%. In comparison with traditional, modern NEMT was estimated to save $268 per expected user (95% CI = $248, $288 per member per year) and $537 million annually (95% CI = $496 million, $577 million) when scaled nationally.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Modern NEMT has the potential to yield greater cost savings than traditional NEMT while also improving patient experience. Public Health Implications: Barriers to NEMT are a health risk affecting high-need, economically disadvantaged patients. Economic arguments supporting modern NEMT are important given decreased support for human services spending.",https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2018.304857,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676791/,economics
"A remarkable consensus has developed that the fee-for-service (FFS) approach for paying medical providers must be replaced. This payment approach is said to increase the volume of services without improving care coordination. In response to these calls, Medicare and private payers are experimenting with payment systems that combine the basic element of FFS - a fee for each service - with arrangements that allow providers to share the savings if they hold total spending per patient below a targeted amount. Medicare's accountable care organizations (ACOs) embody the shared savings approach to payment reform. Private payers have introduced total cost of care contracting (TCOC) in several locations. This article questions the consensus that FFS must go. If the fees are too high, then someone needs to ""bite the bullet"" and reduce fees in key areas. Hoping to control overspending by investment in ACOs is wishful thinking. I describe the theory and practice of shared savings payment systems and summarize recent TCOC contracting initiatives in the private sector. Medicare's shared savings approach is likely to be less effective than private contracts. Cutting providers' fees would be more efficient.

      To determine (1) the frequency of the different types of drug therapy modification claims paid by a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), (2) PBM cost savings and return on investment (ROI), and (3) patient savings from pharmacist-reimbursed drug therapy modifications.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Midwest United States in 2006.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Not applicable; 767 paid therapeutic interchange service claims from the PBM database were analyzed.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Descriptive statistics for PBM costs and cost savings to the PBM and to patients were calculated using all prescription fills.
    


          Main outcome measure:
        
      
      ROI calculated by dividing net savings across all fills by net costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Claims were paid to pharmacists for drug therapy modifications to allow tablet splitting, drug therapy changes, and switching noncovered drugs. Tablet splitting provided the largest cost savings to the PBM, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the claims and representing more than one-half of the prescription fills. Switching drugs not covered provided the largest cost savings to patients. Overall, the PBM saved a mean of $20.31 per prescription fill, and patients saved $14.76 per prescription fill. Mean overall ROI to the PBM was 3.55.

"Background:
        
      
      Over the past three decades, a limited range of market like mechanisms have been introduced into the hierarchically structured English National Health Service ('NHS'), which is a nationally tax funded, budget limited healthcare system, with access to care for all, producing structures known as a quasi market. Recently, the Health and Social Care Act 2012 ('HSCA') has been enacted, introducing further market elements. The paper examines the theory and effects of these market mechanisms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using neo-classical economics as a primary theoretical framework, as well as new institutional economics and socio-legal theory, the paper first examines the fundamental elements of markets, comparing these with the operation of authority and resource allocation employed in hierarchical structures. Second, the paper examines the application of market concepts to the delivery of healthcare, drawing out the problems which economic and socio-legal theories predict are likely to be encountered. Third, the paper discusses the research evidence concerning the operation of the quasi market in the English NHS. This evidence is provided by research conducted in the UK which uses economic and socio-legal logic to investigate the operation of the economic aspects of the NHS quasi market. Fourth, the paper provides an analysis of the salient elements of the quasi market regime amended by the HSCA 2012.
    


          Results:
        
      
      It is not possible to construct a market conforming to classical economic principles in respect of healthcare. Moreover, it is not desirable to do so, as goals which markets cannot deliver (such as fairness of access) are crucial in England. Most of the evidence shows that the quasi market mechanisms used in the English NHS do not appear to be effective either. This finding should be seen in the light of the fact that the operation of these mechanisms has been significantly affected by the national political (i.e. continuingly hierarchical) and budgetary context in which they are operating.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The organisational structures of a hierarchy are more appropriate for the delivery of healthcare in the English NHS.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-13-s1-s1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23734962/,economics
"Clinical research is funded by industry, governments, charities, and hospitals. It is important to know the economic commitment of the various funding bodies, but until now there has been no national source available which provides these data. We surveyed the major funders to provide such a measure. There is evidence that government and charity funding of medical research is a trigger for private sector research investment; therefore, tracking all sources of funding for clinical research will provide policy-makers with an overall picture of health research funding.

"By introducing n (>1) firms with infinite cross-price elasticity (i.e. generic drugs), we explore the effects of competition on the optimal pricing strategies under a Reference Pricing Scheme (RPS). A two-stage model repeated infinite number of times is presented. When stage 1 is competitive, the equilibrium in pure strategies exists and is efficient only if the reference price (R) does not depend on the price of the branded product. When generics collude, the way R is designed is crucial for both the stability of the cartel among generics and the collusive prices in equilibrium. An optimally designed RPS must set R as a function only of the infinitely elastic side of the market and should provide the right incentives for competition.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.08.010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21937137/,economics

"West Virginia, as is true for the nation as a whole, spends far less on public health interventions than on curative care. In 2008 the United States spent approximately $2.4 trillion on healthcare, of which approximately $72 billion was allocated for public health activities-obviously a very small percentage (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services 2010). In West Virginia the 2006 per capita budget allocation for Local Boards of Health (LBH) for Basic Public Health Services was about $6.91, and total public health funding was between $63 and $91 per capita depending on the definition of public health. At the same time, Medicaid expenditures by the State are approximately $269 per capita with total Medicaid expenditures around $995 per capita. The difference in funding for Medicaid is almost 10 times the amount allocated to public health. The funding differences between curative care and preventive care may not be the result of the public's lack of understanding of the benefits of prevention, but rather its focus on short term rather than long term economic benefits. For a state like West Virginia, in which per capita income is below the national average, Medicaid is good business for the State's economy. Far too often public health funding is viewed as a drain from a state's budget not as an economic contributor to the state's economy. As a result, the funding of LBHs is almost always insufficient. The authors were interested in evaluating the economic impact of Local Boards of Health on West Virginia's economy. Although the authors recognize that the greatest economic benefits of public health are the costs averted through prevention and early detection, they believe that if LBH produce a positive economic multiplier State officials may view public health allocations in a more positive light. To assess the impact of LBH in West Virginia, spending data for each was collected. The direct, indirect, and induced spending resulting from public health activity was considered. The results were modeled using the IMPLAN (IMPLAN Professional 1999) regional input-output simulation software to assess the multiplier effects of direct LBH spending. Findings suggest that LBH produce a positive economic multiplier similar to other service industries in West Virginia. The inferences from this investigation focus on West Virginia however it is possible to make a reasonable argument that the fundamental issues are similar for states with similar economies.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00185868.2010.507118,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20805068/,economics
"There is ongoing debate about how prices paid to providers by Medicare Advantage plans compare to prices paid by fee-for-service Medicare. We used data from Medicare and the Health Care Cost Institute to identify the prices paid for hospital services by fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, and commercial insurers in 2009 and 2012. We calculated the average price per admission, and its trend over time, in each of the three types of insurance for fixed baskets of hospital admissions across metropolitan areas. After accounting for differences in hospital networks, geographic areas, and case-mix between Medicare Advantage and FFS Medicare, we found that Medicare Advantage plans paid 5.6 percent less for hospital services than FFS Medicare did. Without taking into account the narrower networks of Medicare Advantage, the program paid 8.0 percent less than FFS Medicare. We also found that the rates paid by commercial plans were much higher than those of either Medicare Advantage or FFS Medicare, and growing. At least some of this difference comes from the much higher prices that commercial plans pay for profitable service lines.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1553,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27503970/,economics
"Out-of-pocket spending is increasingly recognized as an important barrier to accessing health care, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where a large portion of health expenditure comes from out-of-pocket payments. Emerging universal healthcare policies prioritize reduction of poverty impact such as catastrophic and impoverishing healthcare expenditure. Poverty impact is therefore increasingly evaluated alongside and within economic evaluations to estimate the impact of specific health interventions on poverty. However, data collection for these metrics can be challenging in intervention-based contexts in LMICs because of study design and practical limitations. Using a set of case studies, this letter identifies methodological challenges in collecting patient cost data in LMIC contexts. These components are presented in a framework to encourage researchers to consider the implications of differing approaches in data collection and to report their approach in a standardized and transparent way.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26774106/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Game theory is useful for identifying conditions under which individual stakeholders in a collective action problem interact in ways that are more cooperative and in the best interest of the collective. The literature applying game theory to healthcare markets predicts that when providers set prices for services autonomously and in a noncooperative fashion, the market will be susceptible to ongoing price inflation.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      We compare the traditional fee-for-service pricing framework with an alternative framework involving modified doctor, hospital and insurer pricing and incentive strategies. While the fee-for-service framework generally allows providers to set prices autonomously, the alternative framework constrains providers to interact more cooperatively.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We use community-level provider and insurer data to compare provider and insurer costs and patient wellness under the traditional and modified pricing frameworks. The alternative pricing framework assumes (i) providers agree to manage all outpatient claims; (ii) the insurer agrees to manage all inpatient clams; and (iii) insurance premiums are tied to patients' healthy behaviours.
    


          Results and conclusions:
        
      
      Consistent with game theory predictions, the more cooperative alternative pricing framework benefits all parties by producing substantially lower administrative costs along with higher profit margins for the providers and the insurer. With insurance premiums tied to consumers' risk-reducing behaviours, the cost of insurance likewise decreases for both the consumer and the insurer.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-012-0003-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23329381/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      This paper describes the main types of economic evaluation techniques.
    


          Method:
        
      
      To examine the strengths and limitations of different types of economic evaluations, we used a hypothetical example to review the reasoning underlying each method and to illustrate when it is appropriate to use each method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The choice of economic evaluation method reflects a decision about what should represent ""success"" and how success should be valued. Measures of benefit and cost must be considered systematically and simultaneously. Claiming that a new treatment is cost-effective requires making a value judgment based on the personal beliefs of the claimant. Even when cost and effect data are objective, a verdict of cost-effective is subjective. The conclusions of an economic study can change significantly, depending on which patient outcome is used to measure success.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Clinicians must be sure that important patient outcomes are not excluded from economic evaluations. Economic evaluation is a process designed to produce an estimate rather than a decision. New treatment can be more costly and still be cost-effective (if the extra benefit is valued more than the extra cost to produce it). However, since economic evaluation does not explicitly consider a decision maker's available budget, a new treatment can be deemed cost-effective but too expensive to approve.",https://doi.org/10.1177/070674370505000305,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15830826/,economics
"This paper does not address itself to high theory or to complex methodologies; nor does it offer any detailed illumination of key economic concepts. Rather, it focuses on the role of economists and economics (not the same thing) in the formulation of health policies, and in influencing an evaluation of health strategies appropriate to the requirements of the developing world. The paper argues that the 'climate' has changed sufficiently in the developing world to promote a close interest in the economics of health and health care. Evidence exists of a growing willingness to employ economists and economic analysis to resource allocation issues within the health sector. Accordingly, a glossary of economic concepts in presented to demonstrate that economics does possess certain ideas, distinct from other disciplines, which can be of considerable value to health planners and health managers alike. The text also sets out, in tabular form, many of the key questions that should be of close interest to policy-makers, and indicates the economic concepts and techniques that can be applied. At the same time, it is noted that there are very real conceptual and methodological problems likely to be faced by those wishing to apply economic reasoning to the health sector. The paper then moves on from analysis to consider implementation, and investigates the political constraints and institutional barriers to the acceptance of economic analysis in the health sector. In the past, the nature of the economics of health has sometimes been considered improper, i.e. views have been expressed that services should be made available to those for whom they may be beneficial, as a matter of right without regard to economics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(83)90141-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6670005/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      The objective of this study is to estimate the economic costs of cancer on society.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We estimated the economic burden of people with cancer in South Korea. To perform the analysis, we reviewed the records of people who were cancer patients and those who were newly diagnosed with cancer. The data was compiled from the National Health Insurance Corporation, which included the insurance claims database, a list of cancer patients, a database that records the cancer rates, the Korea Central Cancer Registry Center's cancer patient registry database and the Korea National Statistical Office's causes of death database. We classified the costs as related to cancer into direct costs and indirect costs, and we estimated each cost. Direct costs included both medical and non-medical care expenses and the indirect costs consisted of morbidity, mortality and the caregiver's time costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total economic costs of cancer in South Korea stood at 14.1 trillion won in 2005. The largest amount of the cost 7.4 trillion won, was the mortality costs. Following this were the morbidity costs (3.2 trillion won), the medical care costs (2.2 trillion won), the non-medical care costs (1.1 trillion won) and the costs related to the caregiver's time (100 billion won). As a result, the economic cost of cancer to South Korea is estimated to be between 11.6 trillion won to 14.1 trillion won for the year 2005.
    


          Conclusions:

"The cost-effectiveness threshold in health care systems with a constrained budget should be determined by the cost-effectiveness of displacing health care services to fund new interventions. Using comparative statics, we review some potential determinants of the threshold, including the budget for health care, the demand for existing health care interventions, the technical efficiency of existing interventions, and the development of new health technologies. We consider the anticipated direction of impact that would affect the threshold following a change in each of these determinants. Where the health care system is technically efficient, an increase in the health care budget unambiguously raises the threshold, whereas an increase in the demand for existing, non-marginal health interventions unambiguously lowers the threshold. Improvements in the technical efficiency of existing interventions may raise or lower the threshold, depending on the cause of the improvement in efficiency, whether the intervention is already funded, and, if so, whether it is marginal. New technologies may also raise or lower the threshold, depending on whether the new technology is a substitute for an existing technology and, again, whether the existing technology is marginal. Our analysis permits health economists and decision makers to assess if and in what direction the threshold may change over time. This matters, as threshold changes impact the cost-effectiveness of interventions that require decisions now but have costs and effects that fall in future periods.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x16662242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27553208/,economics
"""This paper discusses the redistributive impact of the Dutch social security system on lifetime basis. Net benefits appear to be positive for the birth generations up to 1960. Social insurances show a declining net benefit, whereas for occupational pensions the reverse holds. It is generally assumed that flat-rated social security schemes are more redistributive ones than wage-related schemes. However, the Dutch social security system shows that on a lifetime basis the redistributive impact of flat-rated general insurances does not necessarily largely differ from the wage-related employee insurances. Social assistance schemes result in a very large income redistribution in view of the small amounts involved. Social insurances and social assistance schemes have an income equalizing effect.

"Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether additional risk adjustment is necessary in economic profiling of physicians when claims data are already grouped into episodes of care, and to measure effects of risk adjustment on cost efficiency rankings of physicians.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Four years of inpatient, outpatient, professional, and pharmacy claims data from a mixed model HMO.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Claims data were processed through Symmetry Health Data Systems' episode treatment group (ETG) grouper to define episodes of care and Symmetry's episode risk group (ERG) software to define measures of patients' health risk scores. For each episode type (ETG), ETG-mean expected costs were calculated as the mean costs of all episodes of that type, and risk-adjusted expected costs were calculated using three alternative risk model formulations.
    


          Data collection:
        
      
      Within specialties, physicians were ranked from most cost efficient to least cost efficient, based on standardized difference between actual and expected costs. ETG-mean based rankings were compared with risk-adjusted rankings. Analyses were performed for cardiologists, family practitioners, general surgeons, and neurologists.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      With all three risk models, risk scores were essentially unrelated to episode costs in approximately three-fourths of episode categories (ETGs). In a sample of ETGs for which risks-costs relationships appeared to exist, split sample validation showed the relationships to be unstable or spurious in all except one ETG. Within specialties, risk-adjusted cost efficiency rankings differ little from ETG-mean adjusted rankings.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Depending upon the purpose for which economic profiling is performed, additional risk adjustment, beyond that already provided by episode grouping, may be unnecessary. Additional research may be needed to identify and validate ETG-level relationships between patient risks and episode costs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00499.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16584466/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      As physician compensation and reimbursement tightens throughout the United States, it is important for physicians to be aware of the influence that the economic environment has on the unique medical field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. This study will attempt to determine a relationship between the volume of different plastic surgical procedures and various economic indicators.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Information from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons' annual reports on plastic surgery statistics available on the Internet (http://www.plasticsurgery.org/Media/Statistics.html) was collected from the years 2000 through 2011. Yearly economic indicators were collected from readily available Web sites.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In terms of the total number of plastic surgery procedures performed, there was a significant positive relationship with GDP, GDP per capita, personal income, consumer price index (CPI) (all), and CPI (medical), and a significant negative relationship with the issuance of new home permits. There was a significant positive relationship with total cosmetic procedures and GDP, GDP per capita, personal income, CPI (all), and CPI (medical), and a significant negative relationship with the issuance of new home permits. There was a significant positive relationship between cosmetic surgical procedures and the issuance of new home permits and the average prime rate charged by banks. There was a significant positive relationship with cosmetic minimally invasive procedures and GDP, GDP per capita, personal income, CPI (all), and CPI (medical), and a significant negative relationship with the issuance of new home permits. There was a significant negative relationship between reconstructive procedures and GDP, GDP per capita, personal income, CPI (all), and CPI (medical).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Cosmetic minimally invasive procedures involve less downtime, are generally less expensive than surgical options, and are widely available, making it easier for patients to decide on them quickly during good economic times. Furthermore, it is apparent that plastic surgeons must be proficient at performing minimally invasive cosmetic procedures to maintain a clientele and offer patients a more affordable option during tough economic times.

"Costing approaches in the economic evaluation of mental health interventions are complicated by the broad societal impacts of mental health, and the multidisciplinary nature of mental health interventions. This paper aims to provide a practical guide to costing approaches across a wide range of care inputs and illness consequences relevant to the treatment of mental health. The resources needed to deliver mental health interventions are highly variable and depend on treatment settings (institutional, community), treatment providers (medical, non-medical) and formats (individual, group, electronic). Establishing the most appropriate perspective is crucial when assessing the costs associated with a particular mental health problem or when evaluating interventions to treat them.

"In 1960-1980 Costa Rica experienced a health boom, achieving significant improvements which moved that country into the number two position in Latin America for indicators such as population coverage, infant mortality, life expectancy and health services. In addition, there was a gradual process of integration of health services. But in the same period, the cost of health care as a percentage of GNP increased almost 5-fold and in 1980 was the fourth highest in the region. The economic crisis of the 1980s aggravated the financial difficulties; to cope with them, the government introduced an austere program to reduce costs and plans to transform the current model of health care into a more efficient one capable of maintaining Costa Rica's high health standards in the future.

"Economics is commonly defined in terms of the relationship between people's unlimited wants and society's scarce resources. The definition implies a central role for an understanding of what people want, i.e. their objectives. This, in turn, suggests an important role for both empirical research into people's objectives and debate about the acceptability of the objectives. In contrast with this expectation, economics has avoided these issues by the adoption of an orthodoxy that imposes objectives. However evidence suggests, at least in the health sector, that people do not have the simple objectives assumed by economic theory. Amartya Sen has advocated a shift from a focus on ""utility"" to a focus on ""capabilities"" and ""functionings"" as a way of overcoming the shortcomings of welfarism. However, the practicality of Sen's account is threatened by the range of possible ""functionings"", by the lack of guidance about how they should be weighted, and by suspicions that they do not capture the full range of objectives people appear to value. We argue that ""empirical ethics"", an emerging approach in the health sector, provides important lessons on overcoming these problems. Moreover, it is an ethically defensible methodology, and yields practical results that can assist policy makers in the allocation of resources.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.04.034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15522484/,economics

"Introduction:
        
      
      There are finite resources available to spend on healthcare, with the increasing burden of disease and the increasing cost of providing healthcare it is imperative that methods for optimising health systems to improve sustainability are investigated. This study is part of a larger body of work investigating the potential for telehealth to improve the economic sustainability of the health system. The aim of this sub-analysis is to investigate the breakeven point for implementing a telehealth service; that is the point after which the initial investment is recouped and the cost savings have become tangible.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Literature searches were conducted using broad terms for telehealth and economics to identify economic evaluation literature focusing on telehealth. Articles were included if they reported their findings from a health system perspective, demonstrated cost savings, and provided sufficient information to calculate the breakeven point.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Less than half of the economic analysis studies examined reported cost savings for the health system as a result of telehealth. The breakeven point could be calculated for 12 articles, all of which were included in the analysis. These articles described evaluations for store-and-forward, remote monitoring and videoconference services. The breakeven points for these services ranged from near immediate (less than 1 year) to 9 years. Remote monitoring and store-and-forward services reached their breakeven points sooner than the videoconference services.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results demonstrated that telehealth is cost saving for the health system in a proportion of services. When costs are saved, the breakeven point can be immediate (less than 1 year) or may take more time to eventuate.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x19871403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31631758/,economics

Estimates of illness, death, life years lost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were estimated as a result of alcohol consumption. Both direct and indirect costs were estimated to determine economic burden. Future costs and consequences were discounted at 3% for time preferences of cost and utility. Uncertainties in parameters were assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between 2011 and 2050, alcohol attributable deaths would lead to a loss of 258 million life years. In contrast, 552 million QALYs would be gained by eliminating alcohol consumption. Treatment of these conditions will impose an economic burden of INR 3127 billion (US$ 48.11 billion) on the health system. Societal burden of alcohol, inclusive of health system cost, out of pocket expenditure and productivity losses will be INR 121,364 billion (US$ 1867 billion). Even after adjusting for tax receipts from sale of alcohol, alcohol poses a net economic loss of INR 97,895 billion (US$ 1506 billion). This amounts to an average loss of 1.45% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per year to the Indian economy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Alcohol causes significant negative health impact and economic burden on Indian society and evidence informed policy interventions are needed to control alcohol attributable harm.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2019.04.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055044/,economics

"Schizophrenia is regarded as one of the most expensive mental illnesses because of its specific symptoms and characteristics. The care of schizophrenic patients consumed approx. 2 % of the total German health care expenditures in 1994, according to the scarce data provided by routine German health reporting. Despite this enormous impact, health-economical research in schizophrenia in Germany is widely neglected. While few empirical studies on direct cost of care for schizophrenic patients suggest that adequate comprehensive community care in Germany during the mid-nineties was about DM 27 000 to DM 28 000 per patient and year, there is a serious lackage of cost-effectiveness-studies, relating cost of care to outcome. Thus, the most basic data for any health care planning in schizophrenia is missing. This paper reviews the studies on cost of schizophrenia in Germany. It identifies the most serious knowledge gaps and describes the obstacles for an adequate research in this field.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2001-15383,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11533903/,economics
"After the military coup in 1973, probably the most dogmatic application ever of free-market economic policies was implemented in Chile. The military junta has credited the drop in infant mortality since then to the free-market model. This article explores whether lower infant mortality rates are due to improvements in the socioeconomic conditions created by the free-market, or whether they are due to state-sponsored health care services. It concludes that the socioeconomic conditions since 1973 have generally deteriorated, while government supplemental feeding programs and maternal and child health care services have increased. It appears that the free-market has not been the primary determinant of the decline in infant mortality. Rather, state intervention appears to have been more important. Other morbidity statistics, however, indicate a decline in the population's health status since 1973.",https://doi.org/10.2190/d414-xjax-y1dk-xd45,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6885220/,economics
"The increasing number of economic evaluations of healthcare interventions, and of drug therapies in particular, has been well documented. However, surveys have demonstrated that standards of conduct of such studies have not similarly increased. Of particular concern is the lack of development or even consideration of statistical techniques in the reporting of studies. This article addresses issues that must be considered both in the conduct and in the assessment of the quality of studies. Throughout the paper, examples of pharmacoeconomic analyses are used to illustrate the points made. Recommendations for the conduct of future pharmacoeconomic studies are given. Such recommendations specifically relate to the level of testing that is conducted, the choice of statistical tests and the manner in which statistical significance is reported. In addition, existing methods for the statistical analysis of cost-effectiveness ratios and for the determination of sample size in economic evaluations are discussed, and a partial solution to this issue is offered.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199609060-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10160478/,economics
"In this work, a detailed technical-economic analysis of a fluidized bed based waste-to-energy system for disposal of paper manufacturing sludges has been carried out. Specific reference is made to a case study represented by the largest plant in Italy producing recycled paper, with a daily sludge output of about 52t. The adopted plant has been sized for a nominal capacity of 140t per day also allowing the progressive elimination of sludges accumulated in a previously utilized landfill, giving a nominal electrical power output of 3.5MW. The main plant sections have been described and the adopted technical solutions have been outlined. A detailed process and equipment characterization has been carried out leading to a thorough evaluation of capital investment, operating costs and revenues. A differential analysis has been performed with respect to the alternative solution represented by the disposal of untreated sludges in an external landfill in order to highlight the savings obtainable. The economic profitability of the investment has been evaluated regarding several performance indices. The economic evaluation has been completed by a sensitivity and risk analysis in order to assess the effects of uncertainties in the economically significant parameters. Adopting most probable values, the savings obtained with the considered waste-to-energy system are evaluated in the 15--20 million Euro range during the estimated plant life of 15 years with a foreseen pay back time of 4 years. Moreover, many environmental benefits result such as the remediation of existing landfill, the avoidance of new landfills opening and very low air pollutants emissions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3894(00)00350-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11163691/,economics
"The objectives of this study were to evaluate economic techniques used to determine the cost and benefit of Listeria monocytogenes control and to estimate the economic optimum of L. monocytogenes food safety measures. The level of food safety measures is optimal if marginal benefit and marginal cost equate. Estimates of benefit and cost of L. monocytogenes food safety measures, from available published literature, are derived from different methods of economic analysis (willingness to pay, cost of illness, cost function, and event study methods). The estimated annual benefit and cost of L. monocytogenes food safety measures range from $2.3 billion to $22 billion and from $.01 billion to $2.4 billion, respectively. The estimated marginal benefit exceeds the estimated marginal cost, which implies that more food safety measures are warranted before the optimal level of L. monocytogenes food safety can be reached. However, due to considerable lack of data, the optimal level of L. monocytogenes food safety measures could not be estimated. When better data become available, this study can serve as a template for estimating the optimal level of food safety. The understanding of the economic optimum of food safety level will contribute to designing a control program that is economical and acceptable for US society.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10408690490489378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15969324/,economics
"Insurance is an economic tool that individuals can use to reduce or eliminate financial risk. Health insurance provides risk reduction for economic loss caused by the need to pay for health care services. Insurance for any circumstance makes economic sense provided that administrative expenses to the insurer (insurance company or health plan) are no larger than the risk-premium or the value to the insured of having economic risk reduced or eliminated. Infertility has generally been regarded as a social problem rather than a medical one. Insurance companies and health plans have been reluctant to cover infertility services because of a lack of societal agreement that these services should be included and because accurate information about both the appropriate sequence of care and its cost effectiveness has not been available. Some health plans that have extended coverage for infertility services have experienced poor economic outcomes because of adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when asymmetrical information exists, i.e. when those insured have privately held information about whether they will need the covered services or not. There are ways that the private sector can reduce or eliminate adverse selection without government mandates. These include limited coverage, experience rating, exclusion for pre-existing conditions, mandatory wait provisions, medical examinations and group coverage. When private sector efforts to control for adverse selection fail, government intervention may make sense. Governmental mandates are favoured by some because they compel wide coverage, which reduces overall economic risk. Even this can fail to eliminate adverse selection if individuals or couples who are higher risk for infertility move to areas where coverage is mandated. Given societal acceptance of the need for universal coverage for infertility services, the private sector should be able to create an economically beneficial insurance market for this coverage provided that they avoid adverse selection.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00001703-199808000-00010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9719886/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To analyze household health expenditures on children who are beneficiaries of the Medical Insurance for a New Generation (SMNG), program created in 2007 to cover healthcare costs of children without social security born after December 1st, 2006.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Using the SMNG National Survey, out-the-pocket and catastrophic spending on child health were calculated using several definitions. Results are presented by socioeconomic level, rural and urban areas and for Oportunidades beneficiaries.
    


          Results:
        
      
      About 63.3% of households spent an average annual amount of 3320 Mexican pesos (MEX$) on healthcare for beneficiary children. Between 4.3 and 11.6% of households experienced catastrophic spending, depending on the definition adopted. Due to economic trouble, 15.5% of households postponed and 10.0% cancelled medical care for their child.

"Public procurement is generally an important sector of the economy and, in most countries, is controlled by the introduction of regulatory and policy mechanisms. In the Greek healthcare sector, recent legislation redefined centralized procurement through the reestablishment of a state Health Procurement Committee (EPY), with an aim to formulate a plan to reduce procurement costs of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, improve payment time, make uniform medical requests, transfer redundant materials from one hospital to another and improve management of expired products. The efforts described in this paper began in early 2010, under the co-ordination of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and with the collaboration of senior staff from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Commission (EC) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The procurement practices and policies set forth by EPY and the first measurable outcomes, in terms of cost savings, resulting from these policies are presented. The importance of these measures is discussed in light of the worst economic crisis faced by Greece since the restoration of democracy in 1974, as a result of both the world financial crisis and uncontrolled government spending.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2012.03.015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22502936/,economics
"Market-based solutions are often proposed to improve health care quality; yet evidence on the role of competition in quality in non-hospital settings is sparse. We examine the relationship between competition and quality in home health care. This market is different from other markets in that service delivery takes place in patients' homes, which implies low costs of market entry and exit for agencies. We use 6 years of panel data for Medicare beneficiaries during the early 2000s. We identify the competition effect from within-market variation in competition over time. We analyze three quality measures: functional improvements, the number of home health visits, and discharges without hospitalization. We find that the relationship between competition and home health quality is nonlinear and its pattern differs by quality measure. Competition has positive effects on functional improvements and the number of visits in most ranges, but in the most competitive markets, functional outcomes and the number of visits slightly drop. Competition has a negative effect on discharges without hospitalization that is strongest in the most competitive markets. This finding is different from prior research on hospital markets and suggests that market-specific environments should be considered in developing polices to promote competition.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2938,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23670849/,economics

Since the 1990s, this market, in which investors buy strangers' life insurance policies, has grown in the face of considerable moral ambivalence. The author uses news reports and interviews to identify and describe three conceptions of this market: sacred revulsion, consumerist consolation, and rationalized reconciliation. Differences among the conceptions are considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about markets and death.

"Background:
        
      
      Back pain is a common and costly health problem worldwide. There is yet a lack of consistent methodologies to estimate the economic burden of back pain to society.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically evaluate the methodologies used in the published cost of illness (COI) literature for estimating the direct and indirect costs attributed to back pain, and to present a summary of the estimated cost burden.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six electronic databases were searched to identify COI studies of back pain published in English up to February 2021. A total of 1,588 abstracts were screened, and 55 full-text studies were subsequently reviewed. After applying the inclusion criteria, 45 studies pertaining to the direct and indirect costs of back pain were analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The studies reported data on 15 industrialised countries. The national cost estimates of back pain in 2015 USD ranged from $259 million ($29.1 per capita) in Sweden to $71.6 billion ($868.4 per capita) in Germany. There was high heterogeneity among the studies in terms of the methodologies used for analysis and the resulting costs reported. Most of the studies assessed costs from a societal perspective (n = 29). The magnitude and accuracy of the reported costs were influenced by the case definition of back pain, the source of data used, the cost components included and the analysis method. Among the studies that provided both direct and indirect cost estimates (n = 15), indirect costs resulting from lost or reduced work productivity far outweighed the direct costs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Back pain imposes substantial economic burden on society. This review demonstrated that existing published COI studies of back pain used heterogeneous approaches reflecting a lack of consensus on methodology. A standardised methodological approach is required to increase credibility of the findings of COI studies and improve comparison of estimates across studies.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33974661/,economics
"'Cream skimming' refers to choosing patients for some characteristic(s) other than their need for care, which enhances the profitability or reputation of the provider. Under capitation or other fixed payment schemes, this often means choosing less ill patients. We present a new methodology to measure cream skimming by hospitals. Our approach also provides a measure of a hospital's gain in productive efficiency by caring for patients with lower illness severity. Using a panel of Washington state hospitals, we find evidence that hospitals do practice cream skimming.

"The pressure for health care systems to provide more resource-intensive health care and newer, more costly therapies is significant, despite limited health care budgets. It is not surprising, then, that demonstration that a new therapy is effective is no longer sufficient to ensure that it can be used in practice within publicly funded health care systems. The impact of the therapy on health care costs is also important and considered by decision makers, who must decide whether scarce resources should be invested in providing a new therapy. The impact of a therapy on both clinical benefits and costs can be estimated simultaneously using economic evaluation, the strengths and limitations of which are discussed. When planning a clinical trial, important economic outcomes can often be collected alongside the clinical outcome data, enabling consideration of the impact of the therapy on overall resource use, thus enabling performance of an economic evaluation, if appropriate.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-385-1_14,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19160742/,economics
"Cost-shifting is seen as a three-way phenomenon involving hospital interests as well as those of government and private patients. Without economies of scale, private patients are indifferent to government policies unless underpayment leads to hospital bankruptcy. In the presence of economies of scale, private patients benefit from reductions in government payment under either cost reimbursement or prospective payment. Their interest in a shift to prospective payment depends upon the hospital's location on its cost curve. Hospitals benefit from increases in payment rates in all cases, but benefit from a shift to prospective payment only if operating in a region of declining average costs. The conventional view of cost-shifting is inconsistent with profit maximization and may be inappropriate for many voluntary hospitals as well.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(85)90032-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10300555/,economics
"Background and aim of the study:
        
      
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a possible fee system based on the performance of the nursing function, validating the theoretical and methodological assumption of an economic analysis for nursing.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The I.C.A. Methodology (Indexes of Complexity of Assistance) was chosen as a system able to produce the reading, in an economic sense, of nursing performance to a sufficiently accurate degree, by its use of ""assistance settings"" and ""nursing assistance plans"". For the planning of assistance, the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) was used, as it is a validated and shared language. For the cost of each single operation/intervention and recovery, the ""weight intervention"" algorithm of the I.C.A. methodology was used. This research project was carried out in the form of a pilot study which investigated a sample of 30 patients, and a multi-center cross-sectional and observational retrospective study conducted on a sample of 135 patients coming from three Region of Liguria Hospitals. Results: The study was concerned with 165 cases. It highlighted 65 D.R.G.s, of which 17 were selected, containing comprehensively 61 cases. The results obtained confirm that it is possible to use this proposed approach to calculate the direct and indirect costs of nursing activity, and that it is also possible to compare it to the present D.R.G. system.

"With the development and introduction of costly new technologies and restrictive drug budgets, health economic evaluation has gained increasing importance. Health economic evaluation is now mandatory as part of reimbursement decisions in many countries. Cost-effectiveness analysis, which relates to a defined alternative and indication, and for a specific patient group and specific perspective, is the preferred health economic analysis used to make valued judgements about the efficiency of a new treatment. The costs of the new treatment are assessed relative to its potential benefits in terms of improved health, measured as increased survival and impact on quality of life. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), an index combining quality of life and length of life, facilitates comparisons between treatments for different diseases. Governments are increasingly using QALYas an outcome measure in economic evaluation. The QALY provides an estimate, which is then used to make a decision dependent on the willingness to pay for the treatment, based on a certain threshold value. Current thresholds, usually in the range of approximately US dollars 50000 a year (comparable with the annual cost of renal dialysis), vary between different countries. However, these thresholds are not absolute limits; choices about the allocation of healthcare resources are also influenced by other factors, including considerations of equity and the severity of the disease.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200422004-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15876007/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      To analyze the evolution of relative prices of food groups and its influence on public healthy eating policies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from the municipality of Sao Paulo between 1939 and 2010 were analyzed based on calculating index numbers. Data from the Economic Researches Foundation Institute price database and weight structures (1939 to 1988) and from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (1989 to 2010) were used to. The price database was organized, its consistency tested and prices were deflated using the consumer price index. Relative prices were calculated and associated to food categories and groups, according to the food pyramid guide adapted for the Brazilian population. The price indices for each group were calculated according to Laspeyres modified formula. The general food price index was compared with the indices for each food group and respective category: fresh food, processed food, beverages, meat, legumes, milk and eggs, cereals and root vegetables and eating out.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Price indices for fat, oil, spices, sugars and sweets and processed food showed relative price reduction. Fresh food, such as fruit and vegetables, showed an increase in relative prices. Other food groups, such as cereals, flour and pasta, meat, milk and egg, showed a steadier long term trend in relative prices.

"Objectives:
        
      
      An overview of the status quo of parallel trade of pharmaceuticals (pharmaceutical parallel trade [PPT]) was performed. The different economic, political, and legal viewpoints as well as the public health perspective are being taken into consideration. Analysis is being undertaken on a worldwide level, focusing on the situation of Switzerland in the context of current developments in the United States as well as in the European Union (EU).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Desktop analysis using publicly available information (e.g., scientific literature, congress reports, official statistical databases) was performed during the years 2006 through 2007. Such gathered information was compiled and systematically structured to allow a crude overview of the development of intellectual property law in the last 100 years (as a prerequisite under which PPT legally can exist) as well as a description of the health economic and political context in which PPT is set currently.
    


          Results:
        
      
      It could be shown that PPT is an ubiquitous phenomenon, appearing in industrialized countries as well as in the developing world. Economically, it has gained a significant weight in substantial parts of the EU in the last decade. This has to be seen in the context of EU efforts of enhanced economic and political integration. The worldwide constant growth of health-care expenditures, with its strain on national health-care budgets, has led to increased discussions about the necessity and consequences including possible dangers of PPT, namely, in the United States and in Switzerland, where up to now PPT has been only of marginal importance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The analysis of the value of PPT depends strongly on the importance that is given to different perspectives by the individual analyst. It is clear that an item-centered view of PPT is not able to analyze this phenomenon in an equitable way.

"This paper presents a theory of the effects of rate review on hospital operations and organization. Its purpose is to explain the way in which hospitals have responded to regulation. In the development of this theory, the hospital product was viewed as a bundle of services, rate review was looked upon as a ceiling on the value of the bundle. The ceiling creates an incentive to remove elements from the bundle, i.e., to reduce 'quality'. When quality is variable, the effect on utilization becomes indeterminate. The model argues, among other things, that the hospital will change its service complement and its contractural arrangements with physicians and other hospitals. An extension of the organizational theory literature leads to implications concerning the ordering of hospital responses to regulation. The growing body of empirical literature on the effects of hospital rate review is used as an initial test of the major thrusts of the theory. A suggested agenda for further empirical work also is presented.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(84)90024-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10299548/,economics
"Economic complexity reflects the amount of knowledge that is embedded in the productive structure of an economy. It resides on the premise of hidden capabilities-fundamental endowments underlying the productive structure. In general, measuring the capabilities behind economic complexity directly is difficult, and indirect measures have been suggested which exploit the fact that the presence of the capabilities is expressed in a country's mix of products. We complement these studies by introducing a probabilistic framework which leverages Bayesian non-parametric techniques to extract the dominant features behind the comparative advantage in exported products. Based on economic evidence and trade data, we place a restricted Indian Buffet Process on the distribution of countries' capability endowment, appealing to a culinary metaphor to model the process of capability acquisition. The approach comes with a unique level of interpretability, as it produces a concise and economically plausible description of the instantiated capabilities.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200822,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30086166/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Universal access to health care in most western European countries has been a given for many decades; however, macroeconomic developments and increased pressure on health care budgets could mean the status quo cannot be maintained. As populations age, a declining proportion of economically active citizens are being required to support a larger burden of health and social care, while increasing availability of novel technologies for extending and improving life continues to push health care costs upwards. With health expenditure continuing to rise as a proportion of national income, concerns are raised about the current and future financial sustainability of Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) health care systems. Against this backdrop, a discussion about options to fund health care in the future, including whether to raise additional health care finance (and the ways to do so), reallocate resources and/or ration services becomes very pertinent.

      We received 494 responses to our survey from all stakeholder groups. Across all groups, the highest preference was for policies to modify lifestyle and implement more extensive screening within risk groups for high burden illnesses. There was a broad consensus not to reallocate resources from social security/education. Between stakeholders, there were differences of opinion between industry/advisory and a range of other groups, with industry being generally more in favour of market-based interventions and an increased role for the private sector in health care financing/delivery. Conversely, stakeholders from academia, government, national health services and insurance were relatively more in favour of more restrictive purchasing of new and expensive technologies, and (to varying extent) of higher income/corporate taxes. Taxes on cigarettes/alcohol were by far considered the most politically feasible option.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      According to this study, policy options that are broadly acceptable across stakeholder groups with different inherent interests exist but are limited to lifestyle modification, screening interventions and excise taxes on harmful products. Representatives from the private sector tend to view solutions rooted in the private sector as both effective and politically feasible options, while stakeholders from academia and the public sector seem to place more emphasis on solutions that do not disproportionately impact certain population groups.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-013-0056-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24129648/,economics
"Eye hospitals, originally founded to care for the poor, have developed into academic centers and tertiary ""hospitals of last resort."" Inexorable economic pressures, especially price competition, are likely to close many of them, particularly those which are marginal in quality or management. Survival of the remainder may further depend on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment and to fulfill, better than anyone else, the special mission of basic and clinical research and training. Society must be convinced that some of these complex, highly differentiated, relatively expensive eye hospitals are significant national resources, serve the public welfare, and are worth preserving.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0161-6420(85)33946-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3895105/,economics
"The aim of this methodological paper is to summarize evidence on how to implement cost-benefit assessment according to the new German legislative framework (Competition Enhancement Act). Given the complexity of existing health policy frameworks within industrialised countries in adapting health economics in their respective regulatory scheme, no clear international scientific consensus on which health economic methods should be chosen for assessment can be determined. Nevertheless, a broad consensus on the internal properties of methods itself can be found. Based on these common international standards in methodology, this work provides a minimum catalogue of methods and criteria that meet legal and local German requirements with regard to specific factors of its health care system. Aside from categorising clearly defined standards (e.g., study forms, cost and benefit categories) the suggested catalogue specifies some intensively debated areas in Germany (e.g., the QALY, modelling, the perspective used in the assessment). After the proposition of certain methods the paper leads to a first recommendation of a detailed assessment-process itself specific for the German way in implementing cost-benefit ratios within regulatory decision making in Germany.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-007-0063-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17582539/,economics
"Thorough health economic research of budget-relevant diseases should be one of the major tasks in the German health care system. Up to now cost studies were only performed for special research questions and/or with very limited focuses, e.g. the patients' view. Hence, federal programmes, like competence networks for certain diseases, which were introduced by the German Ministry for Research and Education in the late 1990s, should give a broader focus on health services research. With such an approach health politicians may obtain a deeper insight into areas of the health care sector which are likely to be more efficient after reorganisation. The process of a structured analysis of certain diseases will be demonstrated using the example of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To this end, the results of a research programme sponsored within the Competence Network for Musculoskeletal Diseases will be presented. Direct costs, indirect costs as well as values for health-related quality of life of German RA patients in routine care by generalists and specialists will be discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-005-1192-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16333645/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To examine the historic funding record of the UK National Health Service (NHS) by year (1948-1997), political administration and political party.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Construction of a deflated expenditure series between 1948 and 1997 from published sources of cash spending for each UK country and by four main NHS budget heads using extrapolated NHS-specific inflation measures for each budget head. Analysis of the resultant real funding record for the UK NHS by year, political administration, political party and pre-general election years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A historical funding record constructed from a number of official sources appears to show noticeable differences in volume levels of government spending on the NHS in the UK between political administrations and between political parties. All administrations (apart from the 1951-1955 Churchill/Eden government) have increased funds to the NHS over and above the level of NHS-specific inflation during their periods of office. Labour administrations have increased average annual real percentage funding by around 3.75% compared with an average increase of 2.33% for Conservative administrations. It does not appear that incumbent governments spend more than the long-run trend in pre-election (or, indeed, election) years. The economic difficulties of the mid 1970s (primarily the oil price shocks) appear to have realigned NHS spending at a lower level compared with spending rates in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. Between 1950 and 1997, NHS cash spending as a percentage of gross domestic product increased by around 0.06% per year, with decreases in this proportion in 25 out of the 48 years examined. A comparatively crude analysis of changes in productive efficiency in the hospital and community health services sector between 1951 and 1991 suggests that there is no significant relationship between financial inputs (adjusted for NHS-specific inflation) and outputs (discharges and deaths). One explanation is that the NHS copes (at unknown cost) in times of financial stringency, but, conversely, does not systematically respond (at least, not in terms of increased output) in times of financial plenty. In policy terms, a very tentative interpretation of these findings would be that improvements in productivity can be brought about by restricting financial inputs and at the same time applying managerial pressure to the NHS to at least maintain (or improve) output levels (through, for example, improvements in medical practice).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      As a guide to voting, this analysis may confirm some prejudices. However, judging the performance of political administrations in relation to the NHS is rather more complex than a macro analysis of financial inputs alone suggests. The apparently weak relationship between inputs and outputs and the possible ability of governments to increase productivity by restricting inputs (and hence partially to deflect criticism of their funding policy) perhaps confirms other prejudices about the productive slack of large organisations. Again, however, care should be taken in the interpretation of the macro analysis, since the potential costs (e.g. reduced quality) arising from parsimonious funding are not captured by the global output measure used in this analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1177/135581969900400205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10387411/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      The authors assessed the prevalence and associated economic impact of low-enrolling clinical studies at a single academic medical center.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The authors examined all clinical studies receiving institutional review board (IRB) review between FY2006 and FY2009 at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) for recruitment performance and analyzed them by type of IRB review (full-board, exempt, expedited), funding mechanism, and academic unit. A low-enrolling study included those with zero or one participant at the time of study termination. The authors calculated the costs associated with IRB review, financial setup, contract negotiation, and department study start-up activities and the total economic impact on OHSU of low-enrolling studies for FY2009.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 837 clinical studies were terminated during the study period, 260 (31.1%) of which were low-enrolling. A greater proportion of low-enrolling studies were government funded than industry funded (P=.006). The authors found significant differences among the various academic units with respect to percentages of low-enrolling studies (from 10% to 67%). The uncompensated economic impact of low-enrolling studies was conservatively estimated to be nearly $1 million for FY2009.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A substantial proportion of clinical studies incurred high institutional and departmental expense but resulted in little scientific benefit. Although a certain percentage of low-enrolling studies can be expected in any research organization, the overall number of such studies must be managed to reduce the aggregate costs of conducting research and to maximize research opportunities. Effective, proactive interventions are needed to address the prevalence and impact of low enrollment.",https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0b013e3182306440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21952064/,economics
"This paper discusses the problems of the use of economic incentives as a management tool in the Polish National Health Service, in which the economic approach had long been regarded as morally improper. Health, an important ethical value, was not to be defiled by direct contact with economic realities. It was only in the early 1980's that it was accepted that the non-economic approach had been destructive for both the performance and the moral climate of the NHS. Significant defects in the previous solutions stimulated a great effort to reorient and rationalize the system. In the 1940's when the Polish NHS was established, it was decided to abolish economic barriers to health care, the free access to which was perceived as essential to socialist health care. While utilization increased, access was still restricted, although not by formal barriers but by scarcity of resources. The situation became all the more painful because a general expectation of easily obtainable health services had been aroused. The health sector as a whole was underfinanced; health professionals were underpaid in comparison with professionals in other sectors; the salary system severed the link between input and reward. More productive individuals took extra jobs in the NHS and outside it, thus threatening the quality of the service. A number of rationalization measures have been taken. Special premiums, combinations of capitation and fee-for-service, new financing mechanisms, and forms of patient cost-sharing are being experimented with or considered.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(87)90028-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10282262/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      The accuracy of cost savings and reimbursement predictions for medications added to an academic medical center formulary was assessed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Formulary changes over a 5-year period were reviewed by the investigators. Medications were included if the medication was added to formulary and the monograph included cost savings or reimbursement data that indicated a positive net margin. The primary endpoints were percent predicted cost savings and net margin per medication based on medication cost only. Secondary endpoints included the percent of medications with at least 100% predicted cost savings or net margin and evaluation of median percent predicted savings or net margin individually.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The pharmacy and therapeutics committee reviewed 558 formulary agenda items, 184 of which were selected for further analysis. In total, 19 medications were identified as having a predicted monetary advantage. The endpoints of percent predicted cost savings and net margin yielded a median of 76.5% (range 72.9-188.71%) (n = 3) and 148.2% (IQR 108.9-543.3%) (n = 16), respectively. For 13 (68%) of 19 medications, the percent predicted cost savings or net margin was at least 100%.

"In cost-effectiveness analysis, the valuing of costs and health effects over time remains a controversial issue. The debate mostly focuses on whether the discount rates for health and money should be equal and which discounting model and time preferences are most appropriate. In this paper we add to the debate by arguing that the assessment of effectiveness of a preventive intervention may influence the choice of the discounting procedure for health. Health effects in cost-effectiveness analysis are commonly expressed in life-years gained, QALYs gained or lives saved. These denominators are only indirect and partial measures of the effects of a preventive intervention. The actual effect of the intervention is a reduction of the risk of mortality and morbidity in a given period of time. This risk reduction will not always coincide with the moment at which the impact on (quality-adjusted) life-years gained is made (i.e. at risk exposure), for example when preventing chronic disease with an asymptomatic stage. In this paper we show that truly acknowledging the origin of health benefits could have implications for the discounting procedure. We present a discounting model that adequately focuses on the reduction of risk. This model recognises the potential interpretation of risk reduction for infection as an economic good to be acquired with associated mortality reductions as later indirect effects. This implies that our suggested discounting model focuses on the moment(s) of risk reduction. A numerical example illustrates our approach. We discuss the associated potential implications for public health policy and discuss how the effects of the intervention can be additionally corrected for societal preferences.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200422180-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15606224/,economics
"Although the technological change in medicine has been recognized widely as the major driver of rising healthcare costs, there is very little research that estimates this effect directly. This paper uses both a single-equation and a simultaneous equations approach to investigate empirically the interactive relationship between technological innovation and the growth of health expenditure in the context of the pharmaceutical market in Taiwan. Based on observing 182 therapeutic groups between 1997 and 2006, we find evidence to support the argument that technological innovation and health expenditure are determined simultaneously as technological innovation, and that the growth of health expenditure are endogenous rather than exogenous. Specifically, we find that therapeutic groups associated with higher pharmaceutical expenditure are likely to attract more new products to the market. Meanwhile, therapeutic groups with more new products are associated with higher pharmaceutical expenditures. An important implication of the paper is that cost containment policies will affect not only the growth of health expenditure, but also the progress of technological innovation in the health sector.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-011-0370-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22200844/,economics

Uncertainty about quality of medical and related services promotes product differentiation especially when consumers do not bear the full costs of care.

"This article examines the interplay between local culture, the state, and economic actors' agency in producing variation across markets. I adopt a political-cultural approach to examining why life insurance has been far more popular in Taiwan than Hong Kong, despite the presence of a cultural taboo on the topic of premature death in both societies. Based on interview data and documentary references, the findings reveal that as an independent state, the Taiwanese government heavily protected domestic insurance firms during their emergence. These domestic firms adopted a market-share approach by re-defining the concept of life insurance to accommodate the local cultural taboo. The colonial Hong Kong government, on the other hand, adopted laissez-faire policies that essentially favoured foreign insurance firms. When faced with the tension between local adaptation and the profitability of the business, these foreign firms chose the latter. Their reluctance to accommodate local cultures, however, resulted in a smaller market. I argue that state actions mediate who the dominant economic players are and that the nature of the dominant players affects the extent of localization. Specifically, the presence of competitive domestic players alongside transnational corporations is more likely to produce varieties of capitalism.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2011.01395.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22404391/,economics
"In Canada, there is an ongoing debate about whether to expand Medicare to include a national pharmaceutical benefit on a universal basis. The potential health benefits are understood to be significant, but there are ongoing concerns about affordability. In Israel, the National Health Insurance benefits package includes a comprehensive pharmaceutical benefit. Nonetheless, per capita pharmaceutical spending is well below that of Canada and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development average. This paper highlights seven strategies that Israel has employed to constrain pharmaceutical spending: (1) prioritizing new technologies, subject to a global budget constraint; (2) using regulations and market power to secure fair and reasonable prices; (3) establishing an efficient pharmaceutical distribution system; (4) promoting effective prescribing behavior; (5) avoiding artificial inflation of consumer demand; (6) striking an appropriate balance between respect for IP rights, access and cost containment; and (7) developing a shared societal understanding about the value and limits of pharmaceutical spending. Some of these strategies are already in place in some parts of Canada. Others could be introduced into Canada, and might contribute to the affordability of a national pharmaceutical benefit, but substantial adaptation would be needed. For example, in Israel the health maintenance organizations (HMOs) play a central role in promoting effective prescribing behavior, whereas in HMO-free Canada other mechanisms are needed to advance this important goal.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s174413311700041x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29400645/,economics

Economic evaluation was considered a critical component of the assessment of this therapy given the resources required to administer epoprostenol (Flolan), a therapy that would require lifelong continuous intravenous infusion. Economic secondary endpoints were incorporated in the clinical trial. The economic evaluation of the treatment was integrated into all aspects of study development, including study design, implementation, and monitoring. Since this was a multinational trial, special care was required to ensure that the protocol design was appropriate for all study countries. The economic assessment required the development of several methodologic components: a set of background economic concepts to guide protocol development, a set of resource items to be recorded when required for study participants; a set of data collection instruments for assessment of health-related quality of life for study patients; and a protocol for a resource costing exercise for the study.

"Background:
        
      
      Obesity represents an important public health issue. An assessment of its costs would be useful to provide recommendations for policy and decision-making strategies. The aims of our study were to carry out a systematic review to assess the economic burden of adult obesity in terms of direct and indirect costs and to perform a quality appraisal of the analysed studies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was carried out on PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library to retrieve cost-of-illness (COI) analyses focused on adult (aged 18 years or more) overweight or obese people and published up to 2013. COI analyses that considered direct and indirect costs were included. Each included manuscript was independently appraised by three groups of researchers on the basis of the British Medical Journal Drummond's checklist.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Approximately 2044 articles were initially retrieved, and 17 were included in the current review. The included studies showed a medium-high-quality level. The available studies seemed to be heterogeneous both in terms of methodology and results reporting. However, as many studies have been conducted from the payer perspective, just direct medical costs can be considered exhaustive. As only three studies included considered also indirect costs, there is no strong evidence to give a comprehensive picture of this phenomenon also from the societal perspective.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The review confirmed that obesity absorbs a huge amount of health-care resources. Further research is therefore needed to better understand the economic impact and to identify and promote public health strategies to tackle obesity.",https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/cku170,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25320051/,economics
"In the last few years there have been considerable changes in the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Arguably the most significant of these has been the introduction of competition. Central to this development has been the introduction of general practice (GP) fundholding, whereby practices purchase health care for their patients directly from competing suppliers. Those practices which have become fundholders have faced considerable challenges in developing their purchasing function, given the complexities of contracting within the context of the NHS internal market. Although one of the original aims of GP fundholding was to facilitate locally responsive purchasing, such have been the complexities of contracting that many fundholding practices have attempted to reduce the managerial demands of purchasing through membership of purchasing consortia. Based on an in-depth study of GP fundholders across Scotland, this paper explores the development of consortium-based purchasing. Specifically, this paper seeks to address three issues central to the evolution of such consortium-based purchasing. Firstly, the patterns of organizational structure and the operational dynamics of such consortia. Secondly, the impact of such consortia on the process of fundholder purchasing. Thirdly, the managerial implications of purchasing through such consortia for the participating practices. In addressing these issues, it will examine whether such patterns of purchaser development have impacted on the evolution of locally responsive purchasing.",https://doi.org/10.1177/095148489701000405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10174514/,economics

      In all countries, the assessment criteria used include effectiveness, safety, relative effectiveness, and economic data. In group A countries, the main objectives are improving quality of care, ensuring equal access, and efficient use of resources. Group B countries have established HTA organizations with official guidelines but often seek the decisions of other developed countries. They place considerable emphasis on the budget impact of new therapies, and HTA is also used as a cost estimation tool for state budgets.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      HTA organizations have been developed dynamically not only in high-income countries but also in countries with limited resources. The experience and evolution of both can be used by countries that are in the dawn of creating an HTA organization.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2018.08.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30316029/,economics
"There is a wide variety of ethical arguments for public financing of health care that share a common structure built on a series of four logically related propositions regarding: (1) the ultimate purpose of a human life or human society; (2) the role of health and its distribution in society in advancing this ultimate purpose; (3) the role of access to or utilisation of health care in maintaining or improving the desired level and distribution of health among members of society, and (4) the role of public financing in ensuring the ethically justified access to and utilisation of health care by members of society. This paper argues that economics has much to contribute to the development of the ethical foundations for publicly financed health care. It focuses in particular on recent economic work to clarify the concepts of access and need and their role in analyses of the just distribution of health care resources, and on the importance of economic analysis of health care and health care insurance markets in demonstrating why public financing is necessary to achieve broad access to and utilisation of health care services.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.27.4.234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11479353/,economics
"While the different national health systems merge structurally, cost expansion in health care is a global challenge. Structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the USA which can be summarized as ""managed care"". They are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system, in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economically goods. In managed-care models, patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy. The spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines, which lead to a standardization of processes. Financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse. The autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce and integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system. Leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists. It is progressively shifting to financing institutions, managing directors or insurance companies. Structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the U.S. and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs. Nevertheless, the US model is still far more expensive compared to the German system. Historical development, current concepts of US-managed care, its potential influence and general applicability to the German situation are discussed in an overview.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s001040050430,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9612622/,economics
"In the context of remarkable economic growth and financial development in the emerging economies of East Asia, this paper attempts to shed light on the ecological consequences (CO2 emission) of economic growth, foreign direct investment and financial development in the selected ASEAN-5 economies. Drawing on the data from 1982 to 2014, we employed a set of quantitative techniques for panel data analysis which entailed Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) and Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) approaches. Our findings indicate that financial and economic development, as well as FDI, have a statistically significant long-run co-integrating relationship with environmental degradation (CO2 emissions) in the under analysis economies. It showed that in ASEAN-5 countries, economic growth, financial development and FDI leads to an increase in environmental degradation. The quadratic term for economic growth showed a negative impact on environmental degradation i.e. Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Our key findings manifest and emphasise the importance of appropriate policies for more inclusive economic and financial development and sustainable foreign direct investment which does not impede on the environment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.03.112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31029890/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      Provide a detailed discussion of baseline health spending by state of residence (per capita personal health care spending, per enrollee Medicare spending, and per enrollee Medicaid spending) in 2009, over the last decade (1998-2009), as well as the differential regional and state impacts of the recent recession.
    


          Data source:
        
      
      State Health Expenditures by State of Residence for 1991-2009, produced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Office of the Actuary.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      In 2009, the 10 states where per capita spending was highest ranged from 13 to 36 percent higher than the national average, and the 10 states where per capita spending was lowest ranged from 8 to 26 percent below the national average. States with the highest per capita spending tended to have older populations and the highest per capita incomes; states with the lowest per capita spending tended to have younger populations, lower per capita incomes, and higher rates of uninsured. Over the last decade, the New England and Mideast regions exhibited the highest per capita personal health care spending, while states in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions had the lowest per capita spending. Variation in per enrollee Medicaid spending, however, has consistently been greater than that of total per capita personal health care spending or per enrollee Medicare spending from 1998-2009. The Great Lakes, New England, and Far West regions experienced the largest slowdown in per person health spending growth during the recent recession, largely as a result of higher unemployment rates.",https://doi.org/10.5600/mmrr.001.04.a03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22340779/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      disease-related malnutrition has a high prevalence, with clinical consequences potentially severe for the patient, and of high economic impact for the healthcare system.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      to perform a review of the literature regarding the economic burden of disease-related malnutrition, to assess complications, and to determine the usefulness of enteral or oral nutritional supplementation from a cost analysis perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      a review of the literature up to June 2016 was carried out regarding economic costs of disease-related malnutrition and cost analysis of nutritional treatment, with special focus on retrieval of systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and randomized clinical trials.
    


          Results:
        
      
      a total of 31 publications were selected, 15 on costs of disease-related malnutrition and 16 on costs of treatment. Disease-related malnutrition increases health care costs in relation to a longer hospital stay, higher incidence of infectious and non-infectious complications, greater need of treatment, increase in readmissions, more prolonged stay in the intensive care unit and/or the need of referral to continuing care centers at discharge. Publications regarding treatment with oral nutritional supplements suggest that these oral supplements are cost-effective and cost-beneficial both in ambulatory and hospitalized patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      disease-related malnutrition causes an increase in health care costs that could be minimized, among other approaches, by an early diagnosis and treatment for which oral nutritional supplements are cost-effective and cost-beneficial.",https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.1204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29756981/,economics
"Aim:
        
      
      To perform a clinical/economic comparison of monotherapy with antiepileptic drugs (AED) in patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy (FE) based on the results of previous studies.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The most common AEDs (carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXZ), lamotrigine (LTG), lacosamide (LCM)) were compared in patients, aged 16 years and over, with illness duration of five years.
    


          Results and conclusion:
        
      
      CBZ, OXZ and LCM can be used as monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed FE. Monotherapy with LCM is associated with lowest costs for stopping focal seizures and the highest percentage of seizure-free patients. CBZ remains the most economical AED: the cost-effectiveness is minimal compared to all other AEDs used in the study.

"Since higher charges to private patients are a major source of financing for hospital care to the uninsured, increased price shopping by private payers may mean that hospitals are less able to provide such care. I study the effect of increased price shopping on California hospital markets over the 1984-1988 period. I find that there was a large fall in net private revenues and net income in the least concentrated hospital markets in the state after the advent of price shopping. Perhaps as a result, care to the uninsured fell dramatically in these markets as well, relative to more concentrated markets.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(94)90023-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10138025/,economics
"In an article published by the Journal of Public Health Policy (Summer 1990), Peter C. Coyte argues that it is not empirically valid to say that the introduction of universal medical insurance in Canada successfully contained the growth in the share of society's resources devoted to the health care industry. During the period under consideration, both Canada and the United States witnessed several major policy changes in the provision and regulation of health services. Coyte's decision to apply a simple time trend to the data assumes away these changes, especially the introduction of universal medical insurance in Canada in 1971, whose influence on health expenditures is itself the primary subject of inquiry of this paper. We conclude that both the unadjusted and the adjusted data suggest that the Canadian universal health system has been a resounding success economically, once the appropriate periodization is applied to the data, reflecting the institutional and policy changes that took place. Finally, we propose suggestions for future research with respect to measuring resource usage in the Canadian and U.S. health care systems.",https://doi.org/10.2190/bdy8-fldh-a0jg-re3f,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1769763/,economics
"Recurrent fluctuations in health states can occur as a result of long-term conditions with episodic symptoms or through side effects of cycles of treatment. Fluctuations and associated duration of symptoms can be predictable (eg, side effects of chemotherapy treatment) or unpredictable (eg, relapse in multiple sclerosis). Such recurrent fluctuations in health states can have an important impact on a person's health-related quality of life. When symptoms vary by time of day, day of the week, or during the month, it is challenging to obtain reliable health-related quality of life estimates for use in assessing cost-effectiveness of interventions. The adequacy of the quality of life estimate will be affected by (1) the standard recall period associated with the chosen measure (eg, ""health today"" EQ-5D, ""past 4 weeks"" for SF-36/SF-6D) and the way that respondents understand and make judgments about these recall periods, (2) the chosen time points for assessing health-related quality of life in relation to the fluctuations in health, and (3) the assumptions used to interpolate between measurement time points and thus calculate the quality-adjusted life-years. These issues have not received sufficient methodological attention and instead remain poorly accounted for in economic analyses. There is potential for these issues to considerably distort treatment decisions away from the optimal allocation. This article brings together evidence from health economics, psychology, and behavioral economics to explore these challenges in depth; presents the solutions that have been applied to date; and details a methodological research agenda for measuring quality-adjusted life-years in recurrent fluctuating health states.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.09.2753,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32197730/,economics
"A revolution is taking place in the American health care industry. The basis for these changes is the rapid escalation of health care costs to nearly 11% of our gross national product. The changes have caused a controversy regarding whether cost containment reduces the quality of medical care. Our present system was built on the premise that the highest quality of health care could be delivered to all fairly and without any form of rationing. This has led to a massive growth in facilities and the number of physicians. In simple economic terms the market factors in the environment should have lowered the cost of care. However, the cost of care has increased even more rapidly than expected. It seems likely that older economic principles must be abandoned to control costs. Price competition, preferred providers and more efficient hospitals must all be encouraged. Overutilization of care must be discouraged by proper incentives, and overpricing by physicians may require fixed cost reimbursement. Two-tiered health care delivery will develop and small segments of the population may receive a lower quality of care. Rationing of care may be a simple alternative.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0002-9149(85)80011-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4025185/,economics
"This paper explores how provider and insurer market power affect which markets an insurer chooses to operate in. A 2011 policy change required that certain private insurance plans in Medicare form provider networks de novo; in response, insurers cancelled two-thirds of the affected plans. Using detailed data on pre-policy provider and insurer market structure, I compare markets where insurers built networks to those they exited. Overall, insurers in the most concentrated hospital and physician markets were 9 and 13 percentage points more likely to exit, respectively, than those in the least concentrated markets. Conversely, insurers with more market power were less likely to exit than those with less, and an insurer's market power had the largest effect on exit in concentrated hospital markets. These findings suggest that concentrated provider markets contribute to insurer exit and that insurers with less market power have more difficulty surviving in concentrated provider markets.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.11.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28126701/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In the German Law on the Modernization of the Statutory Healthcare System of 19 November 2003 the legislator enacted payment of a so-called quarterly practice fee for ambulant medical and dental care. The legislator hopes that by the introduction of this fee the central ""steering"" function of the family doctor is strengthened and that medically unnecessary treatment will be reduced, thus reducing cost and consolidating health insurance funds. In public, however, the introduction of the practice fee as a steering instrument is very controversially discussed. The aim of the analysis is to balance the cost-effectiveness of a quarterly practice fee with regard to the specific features of the dental care system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysis of the allocative and distributive effects shows that the practice fee does not adequately take into account the specific features of the dental care sector and that the adverse effects prevail if seen under the aspect of health economics and social medicine.

In this way, similarity clusters of several historical periods emerge in the MDS maps, namely, in identifying similarities and dissimilarities that identify periods of prosperity and crises, growth, and stagnation. Such features are major aspects of collective national achievement, to which can be associated the impact of international problems such as the World Wars, the Great Depression, or the current global financial crisis, as well as national events in the context of broad political blueprints for the Portuguese society in the rising globalization process.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/594587,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24294132/,economics
"The adoption strategies used in animal shelters can have a large impact on the total number of adoptions and donations that take place. Reducing adoption fees during peak kitten or puppy season is one way to reduce inventories and increase the number of open spaces to save more lives, but does not necessarily increase the financial well-being of the shelter if the per-animal costs exceed the revenues generated. We developed a stochastic model to simulate the expected costs, revenues, and net income of a hypothetical animal shelter for various alternative management strategies, based on US conditions. A total of 8 scenarios were developed and compared to the base-case scenario (BC). In the model, scenarios which decreased or waived adoption fees caused total costs to increase due to the escalating costs associated with increasing the total number and density of animals housed. This effect was especially pronounced when adoptions were free. When the return on money invested in additional fundraising was predetermined to be 'good' (rather than 'fair' or 'poor'), net shelter income did exceed costs - but even 'fair' return increased net shelter income compared to the BC. Of the eight scenarios compared to BC, the mean monthly net income was significantly different from that in the BC in all eight scenarios (p<0.01). In contrast, variances were different (p<0.01) in five of the eight scenarios (and the uncertainty that comes with high variance would make planning difficult for shelter managers); however, the variance in net income did not differ from the BC for any of the scenarios investigating returns to additional spending on promotion and fundraising. In these scenarios, because the extra cost involved is relatively low compared to the other scenarios, the potential risk of a reduction in net shelter revenue is reduced. When shelters are aware of the positive and negative impacts of various adoption strategies on mean net income and variation in net income, shelter managers can better strategize saving animal lives and meeting shelter goals, while maintaining the financial health and functionality of the operation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.12.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24380571/,economics
"This article contends that competition advocates have treated the public market as peripheral to the development of a private allocative efficient market based on price determinations. A system which omits 40% of distributive resources, 30% of its users and over 50% of hospital revenues sets the stage for cost/charge spirals that promote greater inefficiencies than those which presently exist. The government in the sixties set a goal of universal quality service for medical care. However, this goal has not been achieved and the sky-rocketing cost for medical care is putting an increasing burden on the government. The authors attempt to provide a basis for the incorporation of the concept of the mixed market through a definition of public and private reimbursement systems. The public sector, rather than paying directly for care, purchases it in an efficient market which it helps to form. The government working with other health insurance companies in the private market attempts to set reasonable charges for reimbursement for medical services. Any price above the competitive level will be paid directly by the consumer. However, quality care is guaranteed to the consumer at the reasonable charge by insurance company referred physicians.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(83)90030-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6879238/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Improved data access and funding for health services research have promoted the application of routine data to measure costs and effects of interventions within the German health care system. Following the trend towards real world evidence, this review aims to evaluate the status and quality of health economic evaluations based on routine data in Germany.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To identify relevant economic evaluations, a systematic literature search in the databases PubMed and EMBASE was complemented by a manual search. The included studies had to be full economic evaluations using German routine data to measure either costs, effects, or both. Study characteristics were assessed with a structured template. Additionally, the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) were used to measure quality of reporting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 912 records were identified and 35 studies were included in the further analysis. The majority of these studies was published in the past 5 years (n = 27, 77.1%) and used insurance claims data as a source of routine data (n = 30, 85.7%). The most common method used for handling selection bias was propensity score matching. With regard to the reporting quality, 42.9% (n = 15) of the studies satisfied at least 80% of the criteria on the CHEERS checklist.

      This review confirms that routine data has become an increasingly common data source for health economic evaluations in Germany. While most studies addressed the application of routine data, this analysis reveals deficits in considering methodological particularities and in reporting quality of economic evaluations based on routine data.

"Background:
        
      
      Cerebral palsy (CP) and its associated conditions can pose a significant economic burden on families, the health care system and the general economy. The boundary for inclusion of costs in research can vary substantially across studies.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To summarize the evidence for burden of disease for CP including the impacts on the health system, the community and carers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature was identified from Ovid Medline, Embase, CINHAL, PsyInfo, Econlit, Health Economic Evaluation Database (HEED) and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) in the Cochrane Library. The search was restricted to articles published in English between 1970 and April 2016. All costs were converted to $USD 2016 price.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-two articles were included. Studies varied from snapshot cost descriptions to more complex lifetime estimates, from prevalence-based to incidence-based studies, and from inclusion to exclusion of non-medical costs. There was a strong positive relationship between CP severity and expenditure. Significant costs were incurred by families and the welfare system to facilitate school and community engagement.

"Transplantation offers superior life expectancy and quality of life compared with dialysis in young patients with end-stage renal failure. However, the initial risks of mortality and morbidity are high. This study used a decision analysis model to evaluate the costs and benefits of kidney transplantation versus continued dialysis for older patients with renal failure. A decision analytic model comparing cadaveric renal transplantation to continued hemodialysis treatment was developed. The base case considered a theoretical cohort of patients aged 65 yr without known comorbidity or contraindications to transplantation who would have to wait 2 yr for a cadaveric transplant. Separate models were constructed for patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease and for patients receiving an organ after a variety of wait-list times. Probability, utility, and survival data were obtained from published reports and renal registries. For 65-yr-old patients, quality-adjusted life expectancy increased by 1.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an incremental cost of $67,778 per QALY. Assuming a 2-yr wait-listed time, transplantation remained economically attractive for 70-yr-old patients (incremental cost effectiveness [ICE], $79,359 per QALY) but was less economically attractive for those over 75 yr of age (ICE, $99,553) or for 70-yr-olds with either cardiovascular disease or diabetes (ICE, $126,751 and $161,090 per QALY, respectively). The analytic results were sensitive only to the time spent waiting for the graft. The cost-effectiveness reduced such that the costs associated with one QALY were in excess of $100,000/yr when the probability of a complication was > or = 50% per 3-mo cycle and when the utility of transplantation fell below 0.62. If available within a timely period, transplantation may offer substantial clinical benefits to older patients at a reasonable financial cost. Prolonged waiting times dramatically decrease the clinical benefits and economic attractiveness of transplantation, suggesting that living donor transplantation may be of particular benefit in this population.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asn.0000042166.70351.57,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12506151/,economics
"This article begins by challenging the widely held view in neoliberal discourse that there is a necessary trade-off between higher efficiency and lower reduction of inequalities: the article empirically shows that the liberal, U.S. model has been less efficient economically (slower economic growth, higher unemployment) than the social model in existence in the European Union and in the majority of its member states. Based on the data presented, the authors criticize the adoption of features of the liberal model (such as deregulation of their labor markets, reduction of public social expenditures) by some European governments. The second section analyzes the causes for the slowdown of economic growth and the increase of unemployment in the European Union--that is, the application of monetarist and neoliberal policies in the institutional frame of the European Union, including the Stability Pact, the objectives and modus operandi of the European Central Bank, and the very limited resources available to the European Commission for stimulating and distributive functions.

Quarterly utilization and expenditure data from 1991 to 2008 were extracted for 83 drugs, produced by 229 firms, that experienced initial generic entry between 1992 and 2004. A relative 'price' for a specific drug, firm and quarter was constructed as Medicaid reimbursement per unit (e.g. tablet, capsule or vial) divided by average reimbursement per unit for the branded drug the year before entry. Fixed-effects models controlling for time-, firm- and drug-specific differences were estimated to explain reimbursement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve quarters after generic entry, 18 % of drugs had average per-unit reimbursement less than 50 % of the original branded-drug reimbursement. For each additional firm manufacturing the drug, reimbursement per unit, relative to the pre-generic-entry branded-drug reimbursement, was estimated to fall by 17 (p < 0.01) and 3 (p < 0.01) percentage points for generic and branded-drug companies, respectively. Each additional quarter post-generic entry brought a 2 (p < 0.01) percentage point drop in relative reimbursement.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      State Medicaid programmes generally have been able to obtain relief from high drug prices following patent expirations for many branded-drug medications by adjusting reimbursement following the expanded competition in the pharmaceutical market.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-014-0083-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550087/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Healthcare resources will always be limited, and as a result, difficult decisions must be made about how to allocate limited resources across unlimited demands in order to maximize health gains per resource expended. Governments and hospitals now in severe financial deficits recognize that reengagement of physicians is central to their ability to contain the runaway healthcare costs. Health economic analysis provides tools and techniques to assess which investments in healthcare provide good value for money vs which options should be forgone. Robust decision-making in healthcare requires objective consideration of evidence in order to balance clinical and economic benefits vs risks.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      Surveys of the literature reveal very few economic analyses related to anesthesia and perioperative medicine despite increasing recognition of the need. Now is an opportune time for anesthesiologists to become familiar with the tools and methodologies of health economics in order to facilitate and lead robust decision-making in quality-based procedures. For most technologies used in anesthesia and perioperative medicine, the responsibility to determine cost-effectiveness falls to those tasked with the governance and stewardship of limited resources for unlimited demands using best evidence plus economics at the local, regional, and national levels. Applicable cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefits in health economics are reviewed in this article with clinical examples in anesthesia.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Anesthesiologists can make a difference in the wider governance of healthcare and health economics if we advance our knowledge and skills beyond the technical to address the ""other"" dimensions of decision-making--most notably, the economic aspects in a value-based healthcare system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-013-9994-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23820969/,economics
"In this paper we appraise current agricultural subsidy policy in the EU. Several sources of its inefficiency are identified: it is inefficient for supporting farmers' incomes or guaranteeing food security, and irrational transfer payments decoupled from actual performance that may be negative for environmental protection, social cohesion, etc. Based on a simplified economic model, we prove that there is ""reverse redistribution"" in the current tax-subsidy system, which cannot be avoided. To find a possible way to distribute subsidies more efficiently and equitably, several alternative subsidy systems (the pure loan, the harvest tax and the income contingent loan) are presented and examined.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041225,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22876283/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      It is unclear why rates of homelessness claims in England have risen since 2010. We used variations in rates across local authorities to test the impact of economic downturns and budget cuts.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using cross-area fixed effects models of data from 323 UK local authorities between 2004 and 2012, we evaluated associations of changes in statutory homelessness rates with economic activity (Gross Value Added per capita), unemployment, and local and central government expenditure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Each 10% fall in economic activity was associated with an increase of 0.45 homelessness claims per 1000 households (95% CI: 0.10-0.80). Increasing rates of homelessness were also strongly linked with government reductions in welfare spending. Disaggregating types of welfare expenditure, we found that strongest associations with reduced homelessness claims were spending on social care, housing services, discretionary housing payments and income support for older persons.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Recession and austerity measures are associated with significant increases in rates of homelessness assistance. These findings likely understate the full burden of homelessness as they only capture those who seek aid. Future research is needed to investigate what is happening to vulnerable groups who may not obtain assistance, including those with mental health problems and rough sleepers.",https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdv126,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26364320/,economics
"Expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli is normally accompanied by the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs). To obtain the protein product in an active (native) soluble form, the IBs must be first solubilized, and thereafter, the soluble, often denatured and reduced protein must be refolded. Several technically feasible alternatives to conduct IBs solubilization and on-column refolding have been proposed in recent years. However, rarely these on-column refolding alternatives have been evaluated from an economical point of view, questioning the feasibility of their implementation at a preparative scale. The presented study assesses the economic performance of four distinct process alternatives that include pH induced IBs solubilization and protein refolding (pH_IndSR); IBs solubilization using urea, dithiothreitol (DTT), and alkaline pH followed by batch size-exclusion protein refolding; inclusion bodies (IBs) solubilization using urea, DTT, and alkaline pH followed by simulated moving bed (SMB) size-exclusion protein refolding, and IBs solubilization using urea, DTT and alkaline pH followed by batch dilution protein refolding. The economic performance was judged on the basis of the direct fixed capital, and the production cost per unit of product (P(C)). This work shows that (1) pH_IndSR system is a relatively economical process, because of the low IBs solubilization cost; (2) substituting β-mercaptoethanol for dithiothreithol is an attractive alternative, as it significantly decreases the product cost contribution from the IBs solubilization; and (3) protein refolding by size-exclusion chromatography becomes economically attractive by changing the mode of operation of the chromatographic reactor from batch to continuous using SMB technology.",https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.652,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21674819/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To assess the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of health behaviour interventions that address the major behavioural risk factors for chronic disease, including smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, and alcohol misuse.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medical and economic databases were searched for relevant economic evaluations. Studies were critically appraised using a published 35-point checklist, and the results are described using a narrative approach, noting methodological limitations. The review included 64 studies from 1995-2005, including 17 reports on multiple behaviour interventions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was considerable variation among the studies by target populations, intervention components, primary outcomes, and economic methods, but the reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were consistently low (e.g. <14,000 Euros per quality-adjusted life-year gained for smoking-cessation programmes in 2006 Euros) as compared to certain preventive pharmaceutical and invasive interventions. Interventions targeting high-risk-population subgroups were relatively better value for money as compared to those targeting general populations.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      In general, the results of this review demonstrate favourable cost-effectiveness for smoking interventions, physical activity interventions and multiple behaviour interventions in high-risk groups. Although alcohol and dietary interventions appeared to be economically favourable, it is difficult to draw conclusions because of the variety in study outcomes. However, methodological limitations weaken the generalizability of findings, and suggest that the results of any given study should be considered carefully when being used to inform resource allocation.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1742395307081732,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18083667/,economics
"Researchers in health care financing have claimed that large private insurers like Blue Cross frequently exercise monopsony power to obtain discounts from normal hospital charges. They claim that the monopsony power derives from a large Blue Cross share of a given hospital 'cost shifting', whereby hospitals offset the discount by raising charges to less powerful customers. This paper re-examines both theoretically and empirically the conditions necessary for a private insurer to extract discounts from a hospital. We demonstrate that the theoretical conditions necessary for Blue Cross to force a discount do not exist in the Indiana market. Using revenue data from 110 Indiana hospitals we reject the traditional claim that Blue Cross pays less than other insurers as a function of market share.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(87)90030-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10282729/,economics

"The aim of a therapeutic medication is, first of all, to exert a positive influence on morbidity and mortality by using in the most economical way the available resources. The objective is to increase efficiency, i.e., to maximally attain a given objective with the available means or to reach a given objective with minimal resources. The efficiency must be effective on the level of the manufacturer, the distributors, the doctors, the patients, and the economy in general. For the manufacturer, efficiency means marketing safe and efficacious drugs at competitive prices and develop new and better drugs. At distributors' level, safety of distribution and information are expensive. For the doctor the therapeutic efficacy of a drug should guide his decision on the first hand, its price on the second hand. Thus the cost/benefit ratio remains without a doubt positive for the patient. In hospitals, on the one hand, the possibility of improvement of efficiency by means of technical progress is very limited, but, on the other hand, advances in drug therapy which allow out-patient treatment instead of in-patient treatment represent a great step forward for efficiency in the economic sector. Resources to face the unlimited demand for health care are scare and the era of ""for health care nothing is too expensive"" is over. Today, the political objective is to have an efficient health-care system in the frame of a healthy and efficient economy.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02075067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6775431/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether the methodology of social return on investment (SROI) could be a way in which the value of a healthcare-related program (children's cancer camp) could be captured, evaluated, and communicated.
    


          Background:
        
      
      The value of healthcare goes beyond what can be captured in financial terms; however, this is the most common type of value that is measured. The SROI methodology accounts for a broader concept of value by measuring social, environmental, and economic outcomes and uses monetary values to represent them.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The steps/stages of an SROI analysis were applied to the context of a children's camp for this article.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Applying the SROI methodology to this healthcare-related program was feasible and provided insight and understanding related to the impacts of this program.

      Because of SROI's flexibility, it is a tool that has great potential in a healthcare environment and for leaders to evaluate programmatic return on investment.",https://doi.org/10.1097/nna.0000000000000557,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29135853/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      In the face of continuous medical progress on the one hand and the increasing cost pressure through the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) system with concomitant hospital privatization on the other, pioneering and economical models for modern and competent patient care are required.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The cooperation model of the surgical department of the Heidelberg University Hospital is based on patient selection according to the grade of disease complexity and has been successfully developed in Heidelberg since 2005. The long-term results on the basis of actual proceeds are presented.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Cooperation with the Salem Hospital chaired by the director of the University surgical department has been ongoing for 6 years. General visceral surgery cases with low complexity are treated at the secondary cooperation hospitals whereas complex oncological operations of the esophagus, liver, pancreas, rectum or multivisceral resections and transplantations are performed at the University hospital. Optimal utilization of the operative and infrastructural resources of both cooperation partners lead to an improvement in surgical training and proceeds. Likewise, another cooperation with the secondary hospital in Sinsheim, which started 2 years ago, has shown similar positive results. Clinical rotation for surgical residents and attending surgeons guarantee a complete and competent surgical training in the field of general surgery.
    


          Conclusions:

"Background:
        
      
      Present cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) provide not all information necessary for decision-making. One of the factors that hamper decision-making is the difficulty in reallocating resources to new technologies. In a CEA, the incremental costs and incremental benefits of a new technology are calculated. In this article we focus on the incremental cost side. The underlying assumption in socio-economic evaluation is that resources from the substituted alternatives can be used to finance the new technology. In practice, however, not all resources are becoming available to introduce the alternative. The budgets in health care are rather fixed and shifting from one alternative to another or from one sector to another is often impossible. Even within a budget, the personnel and material resources are usually not entirely usable for the new technology, and sometimes not at all. Therefore, the present CEA outcomes might overestimate the cost-effectiveness in practice, which might influence implementation of a new technology.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To optimise the usefulness of economic evaluation for health care decision-making by correcting the incremental costs of a new technology for the possible limitations in reallocating resources and adjusting budgets in health care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Case Research. Literature, data from two completed CEAs and interviews with decision makers in the hospital setting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Case 1: The combined outpatient and home-treatment of psoriasis--In a CEA it was calculated that the new technology lead to much lower cost, given the same effects. The direct costs of this technology comprise personnel, material and capacity costs. Personnel and capacity are inflexible with regard to reallocation, at least in the short term. Considering these reallocative restrictions results show that the cost-savings of the combined treatment are in the short run significantly smaller than in the long run: 694 versus 6.058, respectively. Therefore, the anticipated savings, estimated are not realistic for decision makers with a short time horizon. The short-term savings amount to only 11% of the anticipated savings in the long run. Nevertheless, the combined treatment remains a cost-effective treatment. Analysing the budgetary constraints resulted in the finding that the substitution of the in-hospital treatment by the combined treatment has taken place without negative financial consequences for the hospital. Case 2: The ground bound mobile medical team--Economic arguments to implement the ground bound mobile medical team (MMT) are undecided. With respect to the budgetary constraints we find that the budget for the trauma centre is conditional upon the deployment of the ground bound MMT. Moreover, the cost of the ground bound MMT is a relatively small part of the budget for the trauma centre and therefore no hurdle to implement.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      On the basis of these findings we conclude that limitations in reallocating resources and adjusting budgets in health care may hamper the usefulness of economic evaluation for decision-making. Researching the extent of these limitations provides, together with the CEA, better information on which the decision whether a new technology should be implemented and what the expected welfare gains from such an implementation might be can be made. For this a set of checklists is developed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2004.12.015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16153475/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Economic evaluation, linking the costs and consequences of an intervention to indicate the potential benefits of alternative interventions, is becoming established as one of the core tools for decision making in health care. As knowledge of the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions increases, economic evaluation within CAM has a heightened significance.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To explore whether the present framework for economic evaluation fits CAM and what modifications if any are needed for its application.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Systematic review.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive search of four databases was undertaken (NHS Economic Evaluation Database, AMED, MEDLINE, CINAHL). Studies were included if they took the form of a comparative analysis of costs and consequences of a CAM treatment and were written in English. Each study was reviewed using a set of methodological questions to judge their quality as economic evaluations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 19 studies were identified, of which 9 were cost-effectiveness studies, 7 cost-consequence studies, 2 cost-minimization studies, and 1 cost-benefit analysis. Seventeen (17) of the studies involved CAM treatments being used alongside mainstream or conventional treatments. The majority of the treatments aimed to alleviate pain, including chronic pain, back pain, neck pain, and migraine. Only a small minority of studies addressed wider outcomes of particular relevance to CAM disciplines. Nine (9) adopted a service provider perspective only, 7 included wider sickness absence costs and 3 patient costs. Only 1 study included costs to relatives. The quality of the cost and benefit dimensions of the studies was mixed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A CAM sensitive approach to economic evaluation is required. This needs to include a focus on outcomes that explore the range of effects of CAM treatment, an exploration of the client's perspective and not just that of the service provider and study designs that facilitate the individualized practitioner approach so central to CAM treatment.",https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2005.11.179,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15750380/,economics
"Through analysis of the French experience, this article explores the way economic policy has sought to encourage active, well-informed patients by giving them market power. The new status of the patient as consumer is based on two foundations: the endeavour to build a healthcare market and the activation of demand-based policies. The keystone of this new system is a conception of the market as a process constructed by economic policy. Recent measures such as the standardization of care and the introduction of incentives to respect a treatment pathway then constitute effective levers to establish a free-market rationale.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00346760903480566,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21941693/,economics
"Competitive strategies have been advocated as the solution for the economic ills of the U.S. economy. During the 1980s many economists and health care practitioners are arguing that a competitive strategy will bring down health care costs; these plans emphasize the existence of perverse incentives which reward cost reducing behavior with less revenue. Competitive strategies assume the existence of a ""health care marketplace."" Historically, the United States health care sector has not conformed to the ideal of the competitive market because of the special characteristics involved in the production and consumption of health care. Consumers have the least power in the health care sector and yet most competitive proposals are explicitly directed at changing consumer behavior, especially in the area of primary care. Much evidence indicates that competitive plans inhibit consumers from using primary care services, increase long-term health care costs, and ultimately require more government regulatory action.",https://doi.org/10.2190/dgxd-adby-xvdv-k3an,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3082778/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The economization of inpatient care began when lump sum reimbursement was introduced into the hospital sector. Since then, total hip arthroplasty (THA) has experienced a rapid development in terms of annual procedures and the optimization of the clinical pathway. Therefore, it is obvious to highlight THA as one of the most common procedures in the German health care system. In this work, the two most common techniques for the fixation of THA are investigated with regard to their cost structure and their influence on the clinical result.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      In Germany, uncemented and hybrid fixation are used for THA. In this study we investigated the differences in material costs, the duration of surgery, and the length of stay.
    


          Materials and methods:

"In response to rising Medicare costs, Congress passed the Medicare Access and Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act in 2015. The law fundamentally changes the way that health care providers are reimbursed by implementing a pay for performance system that rewards providers for high-value health care. As of the beginning of 2017, providers will be evaluated on quality and in later years, cost as well. High-quality, cost-efficient providers will receive bonuses in reimbursement, and low-quality, expensive providers will be penalized financially. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will evaluate provider costs through episodes of care, which are currently in development, and alternative payment models. Although dialysis-specific alternative payment models have already been implemented, current models do not address the transition of patients from CKD to ESRD, a particularly vulnerable time for patients. Nephrology providers have an opportunity to develop cost-efficient ways to care for patients during these transitions. Efforts like these, if successful, will help ensure that Medicare remains solvent in coming years.",https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2017040407,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28754790/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      In 2000 the Skåne Region (a public authority) and a private contractor made a five-year agreement for the provision of both in-patient care and out-patient medical services to about 30,000 inhabitants in the south-east part of the region. The Skåne Region is the main provider of health care to about one million inhabitants in the south of Sweden and is responsible for all health care (private and public), including ten hospitals. This paper seeks to answer the question of how the Skåne Region can control and cooperate with a private contractor, entering into competition with the public health care providers in the region.

      This is a longitudinal study conducted between 2001-2006. It is based on 28 taped interviews with employees responsible for the contracting process, participating observations and comprehensive secondary material. The study presents experiences made by the contractor and the public authority on how to work out and follow-up assignments within the health care sector regarding patient interest, public interest and professional medical interest.

"In the United States, the cost of erythrocyte transfusion exceeds 1.3 billion dollars annually. The fear of viral disease transmission popularized intraoperative salvage to reduce the use of banked blood. Although the economics of this technique have been questioned, the financial variables in providing an intraoperative autotransfusion service have not been analyzed. We designed mathematical models to determine the most cost-effective strategy based on hospital caseload. Four models were analyzed with a spreadsheet to project costs of an intraoperative autotransfusion service when fully or partially outsourced, performed by a full-time technician employee, or performed by a cross-trained employee. The Partially Outsourced model was more economical than the Fully Outsourced model when the annual caseload exceeded 185 cases. The New Employee model became more economical than the Fully Outsourced model when the annual caseload exceeded 110 cases. The Cross-Trained model was the most economical when annual caseload exceeded 55 cases.

"Background:
        
      
      After the expiry of patents for originator medicines, generic medicines can enter the market, and price competition may occur. This process generates savings to the healthcare payer and to patients, but knowledge about the factors affecting price competition in the pharmaceutical market following patent expiry is still limited.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the market share of generic medicines and the change of the medicine price level in European off-patent markets.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data on medicine volumes and values for 35 active substances were purchased from IMS Health. Ex-manufacturer prices were used, and the analysis was limited to medicines in immediate-release, oral, solid dosage forms. Countries included were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK, which constitute a mix of countries with low and high generic medicines market shares. Data were available from June 2002 until March 2007.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Market volume has risen in both high and low generic market share countries (+29.27% and +27.40%, respectively), but the cause of the rise is different for the two markets. In low generic market share countries, the rise was caused by the increased use of generic medicines, while in high market share countries, the rise was driven by the increased use of generic medicines and a shift of use from originator to generic medicines. Market value was substantially decreased in high generic market share countries (-26.6%), while the decrease in low generic market share countries was limited (-0.06%). In high generic market share countries, medicine prices dropped by -43.18% versus -21.56% in low market share countries.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The extent to which price competition from generic medicines leads to price reductions appears to vary according to the market share of generic medicines. High generic market share countries have seen a larger decrease in medicine prices than low market share countries.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11585970-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21797288/,economics
"Several economic points require consideration when assessing the current cost of health care in the United States and the potential savings from proposed reforms. Most savings projections are based on assumptions and estimates that cannot be accurate under the best of circumstances, and the error in the final results is greatly compounded by even small errors in the initial estimates. Experience with health care programs worldwide, including our own Medicare program, has shown that final costs are usually much larger--often several times larger--than initial estimates. It is even more difficult to predict the behavior of the population under a system that does not yet exist, and it is not clear whether a system such as the Jackson Hole Plan will actually produce savings. The effect of our political system will have on any health system enacted through legislation must also be considered. The political process itself frequently results in more benefits rather than fewer, more regulation rather than less, and the shifting of costs to other sectors of the economy to minimize costs in the health sector. When presented with projections and predictions in health care planning, we must critically examine the initial assumptions, knowing that errors in these assumptions will magnify errors in the final results.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9610(94)90082-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135311/,economics
"For health planners to be able to use scarce resources efficiently and effectively to improve health, it is necessary for them to have reliable information on the productivity of the major categories of health producing expenditures. The present study utilizes a human capital perspective to evaluate the economic costs and benefits of medical manpower to communities in the West South Central United States. The results of the study suggest that beyond problems of maldistribution of physicians and nurses, the larger problem from an economic effectiveness perspective may be significant excesses of medical manpower, although some rural communities could justify, economically, adding physicians and/or nurses to reduce lost human capital. The findings indicate a need to further rationalize the allocation of health care resources as well as the need to consider means other than increased spending on curative medicine (e.g., health promotion and health education) as a strategy for efficiently meeting the objective of improving public health.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1986.tb00143.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10311752/,economics

"This study aims to examine the impact of renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on the agriculture, industry, services, and overall economic activities (GDP) across a panel of G20 nations. The study makes use of annual data from 1980 to 2012 on 17 countries of the G20. To achieve the study objectives, we apply several robust panel econometric models which account for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity in the analysis. The empirical findings confirm the significant long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. The long-run elasticities indicate that both renewable and non-renewable energy consumptions have significant positive effect on the economic activities across the sectors and also on the overall economic output. These results also imply that the impact is more from renewable energy on economic activities than that of non-renewable energy. Given that, our results offer significant policy implications. We suggest that the policy makers should aim to initiate effective policies to turn domestic and foreign investments into renewable energy projects. This eventually ensures low carbon emissions and sustainable economic development across the G20 nations.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0552-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29090434/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To identify whether, by what means, and the extent to which historically, government health care expenditure growth in Europe has changed following economic crises.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Health Data 2011.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Cross-country fixed effects multiple regression analysis is used to determine whether statutory health care expenditure growth in the year after economic crises differs from that which would otherwise be predicted by general economic trends. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved is achieved by distinguishing between policy responses which lead to cost-shifting and all others.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      In the year after an economic downturn, public health care expenditure grows more slowly than would have been expected given the longer term economic climate. Cost-shifting and other policy responses are both associated with these slowdowns. However, while changes in tax-derived expenditure are associated with both cost-shifting and other policy responses following a crisis, changes in expenditure derived from social insurance have been associated only with changes in cost-shifting.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Disproportionate cuts to the health sector, as well as reliance on cost-shifting to slow growth in health care expenditure, serve as a warning in terms of potentially negative effects on equity, efficiency, and quality of health services and, potentially, health outcomes following economic crises.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2012.01428.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22670771/,economics

"Many manufacturers and retailers have cooperated for low-carbon production in various industries. This study examines the role of consumers' low-carbon preference in this cooperation. We construct four scenarios to investigate the effects of consumers' low-carbon preference on the market equilibrium of supply chains' product selection strategy. Based on the game theoretic models, optimal solutions for the two supply chains are derived with different consumers' preference for low-carbon products. Through the discussion, we uncovered the influence of consumers' preference on price and demand and the relationship between the influence coefficient of retailers' promotional effort on consumers' utility and retailer profits. In addition, given the increase of government's low-carbon production subsidy, two supply chains will both more likely choose low-carbon production. Interestingly, under the government subsidy, the profit of manufacturer will increase or decrease more than its retailer and the market structure will not change if the two supply chains have chosen low-carbon production.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15091985,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30213066/,economics

Utilization and economic data were retrieved from available registers and analyzed. Three trends were found. First, the utilization has increased more than what could be explained by the population increase; secondly, the panorama of dental services changed from predominantly restorative/extraction services to predominantly diagnostic/preventive services. Thirdly, the price paid by Danish adults for dental care increased disproportionately to other price developments in society.

"Background:
        
      
      Moldova is the poorest country in Europe. Economic constraints mean that Moldova faces challenges in protecting individuals from excessive costs, improving population health and securing health system sustainability. The Moldovan government has introduced a state benefit package and expanded health insurance coverage to reduce the burden of health care costs for citizens. This study examines the effects of expanded health insurance by examining factors associated with health insurance coverage, likelihood of incurring out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for medicines or services, and the likelihood of forgoing health care when unwell.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using publically available databases and the annual Moldova Household Budgetary Survey, we examine trends in health system financing, health care utilization, health insurance coverage, and costs incurred by individuals for the years 2006-2012. We perform logistic regression to assess the likelihood of having health insurance, incurring a cost for health care, and forgoing health care when ill, controlling for socio-economic and demographic covariates.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Private expenditure accounted for 55.5% of total health expenditures in 2012. 83.2% of private health expenditures is OOP payments-especially for medicines. Healthcare utilization is in line with EU averages of 6.93 outpatient visits per person. Being uninsured is associated with groups of those aged 25-49 years, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and the unemployed, although we find lower likelihood of being uninsured for some of these groups over time. Over time, the likelihood of OOP for medicines increased (odds ratio OR = 1.422 in 2012 compared to 2006), but fell for health care services (OR = 0.873 in 2012 compared to 2006). No insurance and being older and male, was associated with increased likelihood of forgoing health care when sick, but we found the likelihood of forgoing health care to be increasing over time (OR = 1.295 in 2012 compared to 2009).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Moldova has achieved improvements in health insurance coverage with reductions in OOP for services, which are modest but are eroded by increasing likelihood of OOP for medicines. Insurance coverage was an important determinant for health care costs incurred by patients and patients forgoing health care. Improvements notwithstanding, there is an unfinished agenda of attaining universal health coverage in Moldova to protect individuals from health care costs.",https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.06.020702,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27909581/,economics
"Economic evaluation has become an integral component of health service research in recent years and will no doubt become more influential. As resources are reduced in health services, more questions are likely to be asked on the costs and benefits of new treatments. Questions are also likely to be aimed at treatments that are currently provided. Economics related to health care is complex and numerous methods of economic evaluation exist. Full economic evaluation involves the assessment of both costs and outcomes and is ideal for comparing the efficiency of treatments. Partial evaluations can also provide useful information on the contribution of component costs to treatment costs as a whole. The aim of this review is to assess the various methods available to evaluate the economics of health care and to place in context how these methods may be used within dentistry.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ejo/cjl046,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17035484/,economics
"Adverse selection in health insurance markets leads to two types of inefficiency. On the demand side, adverse selection leads to plan price distortions resulting in inefficient sorting of consumers across health plans. On the supply side, adverse selection creates incentives for plans to inefficiently distort benefits to attract profitable enrollees. Reinsurance, risk adjustment, and premium categories address these problems. Building on prior research on health plan payment system evaluation, we develop measures of the efficiency consequences of price and benefit distortions under a given payment system. Our measures are based on explicit economic models of insurer behavior under adverse selection, incorporate multiple features of plan payment systems, and can be calculated prior to observing actual insurer and consumer behavior. We illustrate the use of these measures with data from a simulated market for individual health insurance.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2017.05.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29248054/,economics
"Background: The incorporation of spillover effects in health economic research is recognized by regulatory agencies as useful for valuing health interventions and technologies. To date, spillover effects are not universally used within economic evaluations and conceptual definitions of spillover effects are vague within the context of health economics research. Materials & methods: In an effort to enhance awareness of spillover effects for health economic evaluations, a concept analysis using Walker and Avant's approach was performed to elucidate the key attributes, definitions, antecedents and consequences of spillover effects across a range of disciplines. Results: Key attributes included lack of intention, positive and negative impacts, and two entity/domain involvement. Antecedents included an initial action and desired outcome. Consequences involved spillovers across industries, work life to personal life domains, patient to family member domains and across healthcare markets. Conclusion: The analysis provides greater clarification around the dimensions of spillover effects and reveals opportunities to enhance methodological approaches to assessing spillovers.",https://doi.org/10.2217/cer-2020-0051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32543221/,economics
"Policies that change the environment or context in which decisions are made and ""nudge"" people toward particular choices have been relatively ignored in health care. This article examines the role that approaches based on behavioral economics could play in ""nudging"" providers and patients in ways that could slow health care spending growth. The basic insight of behavioral economics is that behavior is guided by the very fallible human brain and greatly influenced by the environment or context in which choices are made. In policy arenas such as pensions and personal savings, approaches based on behavioral economics have provided notable results. In health care, such approaches have been used successfully but in limited ways, as in the use of surgical checklists that have increased patient safety and reduced costs. With health care spending climbing at unsustainable rates, we review the role that approaches based on behavioral economics could play in offering policy makers a potential set of new tools to slow spending growth.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1348,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23569045/,economics
"Population growth may progressively reduce 1 of the motives for making war. Namely, population growth threatens shortages of resources, and especially land. Impending shortages cause a search for ways to mitigate the shortages. The discoveries eventually produce greater availability of resources than if population growth and pressure on resources had never occurred. The argument runs as follows: 1) Rhetoric about resources scarcity induced by population density has often contributed to international conflict, even if economics has not been the main motive in making war. 2) In the pre-modern era, war to obtain land and other resources may sometimes have been an economically sound policy. 3) Politicians and others in industrially developed nations believe resources may still be a casus belli. 4) Land and other productive resources are no longer worth acquiring at the cost of war.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002789033001007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12342301/,economics

"Japan's health care system can be regarded as one of the best worldwide, provided it remains sustainable. It has relatively low costs, short wait times, low disease incidence, and high life expectancy. However, universal coverage in Japan faces financial challenges due to the country's rapidly aging population. Canada is another of the few developed countries that have universal health coverage. In contrast to Japan, Canada's health care spending is still sustainable according to recent studies. Effective cost control by payers has played a major role, with providers being steered toward evidence-based and cost-effective drug therapies. Furthermore, expanded pharmacy services have been important in suppressing spending on prescription drugs and minor health care services such as vaccination, government-funded smoking cessation, and medication review programs. This article outlines the services provided by Canadian pharmacists with expanded scope of practice. The pharmaceutical profession and its advocacy body in Canada have not only played a role in regulatory changes, but also put in place technological infrastructure called PharmaNet and contributed to appropriate prescribing. Given the current economic situation and demographic trends in Japan, more options should be explored in order to maintain universal health coverage by meeting the funding gap.

"This paper evaluates the impact of market competition on health care volume and cost. At the start of 2005, the financing system of Dutch hospitals started to be gradually changed from a closed-end budgeting system to a non-regulated price competitive prospective reimbursement system. The gradual implementation of price competition is a 'natural experiment' that provides a unique opportunity to analyze the effects of market competition on hospital behavior. We have access to a unique database, which contains hospital discharge data of diagnosis treatment combinations (DBCs) of individual patients, including detailed care activities. Difference-in-difference estimates show that the implementation of market-based competition leads to relatively lower total costs, production volume and number of activities overall. Difference-in-difference estimates on treatment level show that the average costs for outpatient DBCs decreased due to a decrease in the number of activities per DBC. The introduction of market competition led to an increase of average costs of inpatient DBCs. Since both volume and number of activities have not changed significantly, we conclude that the cost increase is likely the result of more expensive activities. A possible explanation for our finding is that hospitals look for possible efficiency improvements in predominantly outpatient care products that are relatively straightforward, using easily analyzable technologies. The effects of competition on average cost and the relative shares of inpatient and outpatient treatments on specialty level are significant but contrary for cardiology and orthopedics, suggesting that specialties react differently to competitive incentives.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-016-0762-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26831045/,economics
"Limited healthcare budgets result in payers adopting policies at national, regional or local level to achieve allocative efficiency in drug spending. Some of these aim at creating a link between pharmaceutical prices and the value they provide by setting a cost effectiveness (CE) threshold as the maximum acceptable ratio between incremental costs and effects of new drugs. The clinical effectiveness of the comparator used in those CE analyses tends to be greater over time, whilst, due to market competition and loss of exclusivity, their price is expected to be lower. At the same time, research and development (R&D) costs increase with inflation and with efforts to address regulation towards increased safety concerns. As effective patent times decrease, a minimum price constraint raises for the new entrant. These features occur at different rates across disease areas and are expected to result in differently shaped innovation curves. In this scenario, we demonstrate that a general arbitrary threshold may prevent further efficient R&D. Investment may be withdrawn before the optimum innovation point is reached and affordable clinical effectiveness may be lost. We conclude that disease-specific characteristics are an additional consideration in CE decision rules to accommodate the particularities of innovation across disease areas.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.08.021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20864202/,economics

"The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008/2009 was the largest economic slowdown since the Great Depression. It undermined the growth and development prospects of developing countries. Several recent studies estimate the impact of economic shocks on the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children. Infant and child mortality rates are still likely to continue to decline, but at lower rates than would have been the case in the absence of the GFC. Asia faces special challenges. Despite having been the fastest growing region in the world for decades, and even before the current crisis, this region accounted for nearly 34% of global deaths of children under 5, more than 40% of maternal deaths and 60% of newborn deaths. Global development goals cannot be achieved without much faster and deeper progress in Asia. Current health financing systems in much of Asia are not well placed to respond to the needs of women and their children, or the recent global financial and economic slowdown. Public expenditure is often already too low, and high levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure are an independent cause of inequity and impoverishment for women and their children. The GFC highlights the need for reforms that will improve health outcomes for the poor, protect the vulnerable from financial distress, improve public expenditure patterns and resource allocation decisions, and so strengthen health systems. This paper aims to highlight the most recent assessments of how economic shocks, including the GFC, affect the poor in developing countries, especially vulnerable women and children in Asia. It concludes that conditional cash transfers, increasing taxation on tobacco and increasing the level, and quality, of public expenditure through well-designed investment programmes are particularly relevant in the context of an economic shock. That is because these initiatives simultaneously improve health outcomes for the poor and vulnerable, protect them from further financial distress, improve public financing and/or provide a much-needed counter-cyclical stimulus at times of economic slowdown.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czq067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20961944/,economics

"Equity in health care financing is recognised as a main goal in health policy. It implies that payments should be linked to capacity to pay and that households should be protected against catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). The risk of CHE is inversely related to the share of out-of-pocket payments (OOP) in total health expenditure. In Portugal, OOP represented 26% of total health expenditure in 2010 [one of the highest among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries]. This study aims to identify the proportion of households with CHE in Portugal and the household factors associated with this outcome. Additionally, progressivity indices are calculated for OOP and private health insurance. Data were taken from the Portuguese Household Budget Survey 2010/2011. The prevalence of CHE is 2.1%, which is high for a developed country with a universal National Health Service. The main factor associated with CHE is the presence of at least one elderly person in households (when the risk quadruples). Payments are particularly regressive for medicines. Regarding the results by regions, the Kakwani index for total OOP is larger (negative) for the Centre and lower, not significant, for the Azores.

"We focus on the influence of external sources of information upon financial markets. In particular, we develop a stochastic agent-based market model characterized by a certain herding behavior as well as allowing traders to be influenced by an external dynamic signal of information. This signal can be interpreted as a time-varying advertising, public perception or rumor, in favor or against one of two possible trading behaviors, thus breaking the symmetry of the system and acting as a continuously varying exogenous shock. As an illustration, we use a well-known German Indicator of Economic Sentiment as information input and compare our results with Germany's leading stock market index, the DAX, in order to calibrate some of the model parameters. We study the conditions for the ensemble of agents to more accurately follow the information input signal. The response of the system to the external information is maximal for an intermediate range of values of a market parameter, suggesting the existence of three different market regimes: amplification, precise assimilation and undervaluation of incoming information.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26204451/,economics
"Greater attention in health care over the last 2 decades has been placed on determining how best to spend the resources available. Economic evaluation is a commonly used tool to compare health-care services and treatments on the basis of costs and benefits. However, the principles on which economic evaluations are based are not well understood, and guidelines for conducting such evaluations in practice are often not followed. This paper describes the overarching principle of opportunity cost, and highlights the implication that decision-making in health care should necessarily be based on both costs and benefits. Two notions of efficiency, technical and allocative, are also presented, and the important point is made that the specific type of economic evaluation chosen must be based not on the unit of benefit in the given study, as is commonly done, but rather on the type of efficiency being addressed. The 3 primary types of economic evaluation are outlined, and a common pitfall in economic evaluation, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, is critiqued. Finally, a number of methodological considerations when conducting economic evaluations in practice are presented.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s1701-2163(16)30109-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12610674/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Uncomplicated surgical care has highly variable costs. High costs of complications have led payers to deny additional payments even for predictable complications.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      A payment warranty indexed to effective and efficient hospitals can promote quality and economic stewardship in surgical care.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Analysis of hospital costs for elective colon surgery in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample from 2002 through 2005.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      A 20% sample of acute care hospitals in the United States.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Data for elective colon resections were used to create predictive models for adverse outcomes (AOs) and costs. Total hospital costs were determined using cost-to-charge ratios. Costs of AOs were computed as total costs minus predicted costs of uncomplicated care. Surgical warranties were computed as the probability of AOs times per-case predicted costs of AOs. Final predictive models were calibrated using data only from effective and efficient hospitals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We studied 51 602 cases from 632 hospitals. There were 4048 (7.8%) AOs with 505 deaths (1.0%); 19 hospitals had excessive AOs and 95 hospitals had excessive costs. For 518 effective and efficient hospitals, total per-case costs for routine care were $9843 with an average warranty of $1294 and a $276 stop-loss allocation. This cost model would reduce national expenditures for colon surgery by 6%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Complications and costs of care can be indexed to quality performing hospitals. Warranties for surgical care can reward effective and efficient care and preclude the need for additional payments for complications.",https://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.2010.106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20644127/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Costs of health services for hypertension and the financial consequences of epidemiologic changes in this disease are important concerns for health systems in Latin America.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted longitudinal analyses of the economic impact of the epidemiologic changes on health care services for hypertension in the Mexican health care system. The cost evaluation method used was based on costing technique by production function and consensus techniques. To estimate the epidemiologic changes and financial consequences for the period 2005 to 2007, three probabilistic models were constructed according to the Box-Jenkins technique.
    


          Results:
        
      
      If changes are not implemented in prevention programs to reduce the effects of current risk factors, there will be increases in the number of patients with hypertension as well as in the financial burden to treat the disease. The amount allocated for hypertension in 2007, which will be 6% to 8% of the total health budget, is US$ 2,486,145,132. Of these, US$ 1,178,725,132 will be direct costs and US$ 1,307,420,000 will be indirect costs. Regarding epidemiologic changes for 2005 v 2007 (P < .05), an increase is expected, although results show a greater increase in insured populations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      If the risk factors and different health programs remain as they currently are, the economic impact of expected epidemiologic changes on the social security system will be particularly strong. Another relevant financial factor is the appearance of internal competition in the allocation of financial resources among the main providers of health services for hypertension; this factor becomes even more complicated within each provider.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjhyper.2005.10.028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16733225/,economics

"DRG-based reimbursement for inpatient services is an option currently being considered by federal policy makers, but little is known about how physician DRGs might work. We performed simulations of potential impacts, using Medicare claims from four states. Although physician-related inpatient costs associated with surgical DRGs were quite homogeneous, those associated with medical admissions varied dramatically. This suggests that DRG payment could be a lottery, with inequitable losses for some physicians and windfall gains for others. Potential gains and losses were also found to be systematically related to the specialty of the attending physician. General practitioners and ophthalmologists would gain financially on average, whereas medical specialists and some surgical specialists would incur net losses. These differences may be due to the triaging of more seriously ill patients within a given DRG to certain specialists.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198509123131106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3927164/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy has recently created guidelines for the submission of pharmacoeconomic models. Although these guidelines provide a general framework for the integration of pharmacoeconomic models in the drug selection process, a more disease-specific and practical 'hands-on' approach is needed for pharmacy staff and Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) committee members.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To answer the question, 'How can pharmacoeconomic models comparing treatments for diabetes and its complications be evaluated and used to make more informed formulary decisions?'
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We determined the information needs of a managed care organisation (MCO) making coverage decisions for diabetes therapies and reviewed current guidelines for the submission of pharmacoeconomic models to MCOs. We then developed a set of practical questions for evaluating models of diabetes treatment in a managed-care environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Information needed by P&T committees in relation to new diabetes medications includes the long-term benefits of reduced micro- and macrovascular complications and changes in drug utilisation patterns, in addition to the immediate drug budget impact. Because diabetes is a complex disease, the peer-review process should be relied on as a first step to help ensure the validity of a model. Then, the end-user of a model should evaluate the sources of data to inform the model,the generalisability of the model for an MCO population, andthe face validity of the assumptions of the model.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pharmacoeconomic models in diabetes offer potential for assisting P&T committee members in making more informed decisions. The guidelines presented here provide a practical approach for model assessment. However, additional expertise will be needed by MCOs to appropriately evaluate these models, and joint educational programmes between managed care, academia, and industry should be considered as a mechanism for improving technology assessment in diabetes care.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200220001-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12036381/,economics
This paper argues that a cost/benefit-type economic analysis of whether or not to prohibit euthanasia should not be undertaken by health services managers unless ethical issues have been resolved to a particular conclusion. A conclusion on ethical grounds in favour of the prohibition of euthanasia renders the consideration of economic criteria redundant. The case of the German euthanasia programme in the 1930s is used to illustrate the danger of attempting to combine ethical and economic criteria into a single decision rule.,https://doi.org/10.1177/095148480101400108,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11246786/,economics

"Whilst contingent valuation is increasingly used in economics to value benefits, questions remain concerning its external validity that is do hypothetical responses match actual responses? We present results from the first within sample field test. Whilst Hypothetical No is always an Actual No, Hypothetical Yes exceed Actual Yes responses. A constant rate of response reversals across bids/prices could suggest theoretically consistent option value responses. Certainty calibrations (verbal and numerical response scales) minimise hypothetical-actual discrepancies offering a useful solution.

"The triad of age, gender, and disabling chronic illness sets the stage for increased dependence and deprivation in later life. Women are three times more likely than men to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As a prototype of a chronic illness, RA affects all dimensions of a woman's life, usually beginning with physical function, which results in loss of work, social, and recreational activities. Because women incur 40% more chronic illness and live longer than men do, they require more health care and supportive services as they age. Women typically earn less money during their working lives than do men and are more likely to be economically impoverished in old age. Research is needed to identify the multidimensional impact of RA on older women and to explore treatment, life-style, and work options that will help younger cohorts of women prepare for their economic needs in old age.",https://doi.org/10.1080/07399339409516130,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8002422/,economics
"The rising cost of pharmaceuticals has created a focus on hospital cost containment. From 1990 to 2000, spending on prescription drugs increased 200%.

The field of pharmacoeconomics looks at the cost effectiveness of the drugs we use. The pressures on the pharmaceutical industry and hospitals are reviewed here with a discussion of antibiotic prophylaxis, new expensive therapies, and physician responsibility. The driving force behind hospital formulary design is often economic, whereas the physician desires variety and efficacy.

"The regulation of pricing and trade for in-patent medicines within the European pharmaceutical sector presents a major challenge. In conditions of large sunk costs and consumers with differential willingness to pay--between different Member States--an efficient way of pricing in-patent medicines is through price discrimination, by which more is charged in markets that can bear it and re-exports are prevented from undercutting this strategy. Parallel trade and the use of international price comparisons by government regulators can result in pressure for price convergence with consequent delays in launching products in certain markets. Imposing free movement of pharmaceuticals may particularly harm patients in lower income Member States, who may find pharmaceuticals more expensive or unavailable.

"Economic analyses of environmental mitigation and other interdisciplinary public policy issues can be much more useful if they critically examine what other disciplines have to say, insist on using the most relevant observational data and the scientific method, and examine lower cost alternatives to the change proposed. These general principles are illustrated by applying them to the case of climate change mitigation, one of the most interdisciplinary of public policy issues. The analysis shows how use of these principles leads to quite different conclusions than those of most previous such economic analyses, as follows: The economic benefits of reducing CO(2) emissions may be about two orders of magnitude less than those estimated by most economists because the climate sensitivity factor (CSF) is much lower than assumed by the United Nations because feedback is negative rather than positive and the effects of CO(2) emissions reductions on atmospheric CO(2) appear to be short rather than long lasting. The costs of CO(2) emissions reductions are very much higher than usually estimated because of technological and implementation problems recently identified. Geoengineering such as solar radiation management is a controversial alternative to CO(2) emissions reductions that offers opportunities to greatly decrease these large costs, change global temperatures with far greater assurance of success, and eliminate the possibility of low probability, high consequence risks of rising temperatures, but has been largely ignored by economists. CO(2) emissions reductions are economically unattractive since the very modest benefits remaining after the corrections for the above effects are quite unlikely to economically justify the much higher costs unless much lower cost geoengineering is used.The risk of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming appears to be so low that it is not currently worth doing anything to try to control it, including geoengineering.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph8040985,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21695026/,economics
"Despite the failure of recent attempts to reform health care, strategies of managed competition remain the dominant prescription for government oversight of managed care. A number of assumptions and prescriptions in the conventional managed competition model are challenged. More specifically, externalities in the costs and benefits associated with health care and asymmetric information between providers and patients make it unlikely that a managed care system designed to be responsive to consumers will, in practice, produce socially desirable outcomes. An alternative approach for the regulation of managed care more explicitly protects the role of health care professionals as agents for their patients while defining the appropriate role of managed care as the agent for broader societal interests. This strategy of ""countervailing agency-"" acknowledges that oversight of managed care inevitably involves value-laden choices. It is based on institutional arrangements and regulatory strategies that are intended to balance competing interests and values.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.00044,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9063300/,economics
"Aim:
        
      
      Poorly conducted economic evaluations have the potential to mislead both clinicians, leading to inappropriate treatment choices, and payers who must decide on the reimbursement of treatment costs. This paper reviews the methods used in economic evaluations in haemophilia and proposes standards for conducting and reporting such evaluations in the future.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of economic evaluations in haemophilia published since 2008 was conducted. The reporting and methods of the studies were assessed using the recently published Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Guidelines (CHEERS) checklist. The key methodological deficiencies in the studies were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, classified as follows: prophylaxis vs. treatment on-demand (five studies); use of bypassing therapy (six); immune tolerance induction (four); and other topics (six). In general, the quality of reporting was good. However, it was poorest for the CHEERS item of patient heterogeneity, with most studies lacking discussion of heterogeneity in the patient population. The main recurring methodological deficiencies were the evaluation of single episodes of care rather than entire treatment strategies; inadequate control for confounders when comparing treatment options; the frequent use of expert opinion to determine drug doses and treatment patterns; lack of consideration of patient heterogeneity; failure to identify patient subgroups; and the inadequate exploration of uncertainty in estimates.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A set of 12 standards for future reporting and conduct of economic evaluations within haemophilia is proposed, with the objective of making such evaluations more relevant and reliable for those making treatment and reimbursement decisions in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13173,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28111847/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate the economic effect of a pharmacy benefit expansion on a population of Oklahoma Medicaid recipients and to determine whether recipients who routinely maximized their monthly prescription limit (cap) before the benefit expansion benefited more from the expansion than the remainder of the study population.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Retrospective study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Oklahoma Medicaid claims data from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2004.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Data from 15,936 Oklahoma Medicaid recipients.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Retrospective administrative analysis using the Oklahoma Health Care Authority pharmacy and medical claims databases.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Total health care expenditures per recipient per year, total medical expenditures per recipient per year, and total pharmacy expenditures per recipient per year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Total health care expenditures increased 17% after the benefit expansion (P < 0.0001). Of this increase, 65% was attributed to pharmacy expenditures and 35% to medical expenditures. However, a subpopulation of recipients who routinely reached their prescription limit before the expansion had a statistically significant increase in total and pharmacy expenditures; a statistically significant increase in medical expenditures was not observed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although total health care expenditures increased after a monthly pharmacy benefit in a Medicaid population was expanded, a subpopulation of recipients identified as high pharmacy users before the expansion did not have a statistically significant increase in medical expenditures, whereas those who were non-high users experienced a significant increase. Additionally, this subpopulation experienced a nonsignificant decrease in hospital expenditures.

"We consider policy issues regarding parallel imports (PIs) of brand-name pharmaceuticals in the European Union, where such trade is permitted. We develop a simple model in which an original manufacturer competes in its home market with PI firms. The model suggests that for small trade costs the original manufacturer will accommodate the import decisions of parallel traders and that the price in the home market falls as the volume of parallel imports rises. Using data from Sweden we find that the prices of drugs subject to competition from parallel imports fell relative to other drugs over the period 1994-1999. Econometric analysis finds that parallel imports significantly reduced manufacturing prices, by 12-19%.

Non-SNHs experienced a greater percentage increase in Medicaid stays than did SNHs (DID = 13.8 percent, p = .041). For SNHs, the average decrease in uninsured stays (-146) was similar to the increase in Medicaid stays (153); privately insured stays were stable. For non-SNHs, the decrease in uninsured (-63) plus privately insured (-33) stays was similar to the increase in Medicaid stays (105).

"This paper presents the findings of a critical review of studies carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) focusing on the economic consequences for households of illness and health care use. These include household level impacts of direct costs (medical treatment and related financial costs), indirect costs (productive time losses resulting from illness) and subsequent household responses. It highlights that health care financing strategies that place considerable emphasis on out-of-pocket payments can impoverish households. There is growing evidence of households being pushed into poverty or forced into deeper poverty when faced with substantial medical expenses, particularly when combined with a loss of household income due to ill-health. Health sector reforms in LMICs since the late 1980s have particularly focused on promoting user fees for public sector health services and increasing the role of the private for-profit sector in health care provision. This has increasingly placed the burden of paying for health care on individuals experiencing poor health. This trend seems to continue even though some countries and international organisations are considering a shift away from their previous pro-user fee agenda. Research into alternative health care financing strategies and related mechanisms for coping with the direct and indirect costs of illness is urgently required to inform the development of appropriate social policies to improve access to essential health services and break the vicious cycle between illness and poverty.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.07.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16099574/,economics

The objective of the paper is to review some of the recent changes achieved in the system, and to discuss about providing some alternative ideas to the implemented policies. The existing universal coverage previous to the crisis, as acknowledged by the law, has changed last year and the new figure of 'insured person' has been introduced into the system. These persons are now the only ones eligible to receive healthcare under the public coverage. New co-payments have been introduced for drugs, and retired persons must also pay a 10% co-payment (which was 0% before) at the chemist office.

Some regions have privatized healthcare management of some hospitals (as Madrid) to control budget and presumably to obtain a higher efficiency.

          Study design:
        
      
      The unit of analysis is an individual procedure. Multi-variate regression methods for cross-sectional/times-series data are applied to estimate the utilization-fee relationship while controlling for supply- and demand-side determinants of utilization.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      There is no evidence of a strong, uniform utilization response among the 11 procedures analyzed. The results include a mixture of significant and non-significant fee coefficients, and among the significant coefficients, a mixture of signs is observed. The results are consistent with utility-maximizing behaviour by physicians rather than with profit-maximizing behaviour.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The fact that the direction and degree of the utilization effect associated with changing fees is procedure-specific has direct implications for our ability to develop effective policies to modify physician behaviour that are based primarily on financial incentives, particularly those based on manipulating fees. The study also highlights the limitations of analyses based on aggregate data and suggests methodological approaches that have potential to overcome some of these limitations to fill gaps in our current knowledge.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4730040601,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653183/,economics
"Traditionally, economic evaluations in terms of cost-effectiveness analysis are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the assumption of constant returns to scale. This assumption has been criticized in the literature and the role of cost-effectiveness as a tool for decision making has been questioned. In this paper we analyze the case of increasing returns to scale due to fixed capital costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis is regarded as a tool for estimating a cost function. To this cost function two types of decision rules can be applied, the budget approach and the constant price approach. It is shown that in the presence of fixed capital costs the application of these two decision rules to a specific patient group will give different results. The budget approach may lead to suboptimizations, while using the price as a decision rule will give optimal solutions. With fixed capital costs and when an investment can be used for treating several patient groups, these groups are no longer independent. Therefore the cost-effectiveness analysis has to be performed simultaneously for all patient groups that are potential users of the investment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(97)10046-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9572608/,economics

"We study the optimal interventions of a regulator (a central bank or government) on the illiquidity default contagion process in a large, heterogeneous, unsecured interbank lending market. The regulator has only partial information on the interbank connections and aims to minimize the fraction of final defaults with minimal interventions. We derive the analytical results of the asymptotic optimal intervention policy and the asymptotic magnitude of default contagion in terms of the network characteristics. We extend the results of Amini, Cont and Minca's work to incorporate interventions and adopt the dynamics of Amini, Minca and Sulem's model to build heterogeneous networks with degree sequences and initial equity levels drawn from arbitrary distributions. Our results generate insights that the optimal intervention policy is ""monotonic"" in terms of the intervention cost, the closeness to invulnerability and connectivity. The regulator should prioritize interventions on banks that are systematically important or close to invulnerability. Moreover, the regulator should keep intervening on a bank once having intervened on it. Our simulation results show a good agreement with the theoretical results.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209819,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30645587/,economics

"Economic vulnerability is an important indicator to measure regional coordination, health and stability. Despite the importance of vulnerabilities, this is the first study that presents 26 indicators selected from the dimensions of the domestic economic system, external economic system and financial system in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. A quantitative analysis is conducted to analyze the characteristics of spatial heterogeneity of vulnerability of the economic subsystems and the comprehensive economic system of the BRI countries and the main influencing factors of the comprehensive economic system vulnerability (CESV) are identified based on obstacle degree model. The results show that the CESV of the East Asia, South Asia and ASEAN countries are lower than that of the Middle Eastern Europe, Central Asia and West Asia countries. The CESV of the BRI countries are generally in the middle level and the average vulnerability index of highly vulnerable countries is twice as much as that of lowly vulnerable countries. In addition, in terms of the vulnerability of the three subsystems, the spatial distribution of vulnerability of the domestic economic system (DESV) and financial system (FSV) is basically consistent with the spatial distribution pattern of CESV, both of which are low in East Asia and South Asia and high in West Asia and Central Asia. While, the vulnerability of external economic system (EESV) shows a different spatial pattern, with vulnerability of West Asia, Central Asia and ASEAN higher than that of East Asia and South Asia. The main obstacle factors influencing the CESV of BRI countries include GDP growth rate, saving ratio, ratio of bank capital to assets, service industry level, industrialization level and loan rate. Therefore, the key way to maintain the stability and mitigate the vulnerability of the economic system of BRI countries is to focus on the macroeconomic development and operation, stimulate the economy and market vitality, promote the development of industries, especially the service and secondary industries, and optimize the economic structure, banking system and financial system.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262611,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35030212/,economics
"Aims:
        
      
      To evaluate potential health and economic returns from implementing smoking cessation interventions in Hungary.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The EQUIPTMOD, a Markov-based economic model, was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of three implementation scenarios: (a) introducing a social marketing campaign; (b) doubling the reach of existing group-based behavioural support therapies and proactive telephone support; and (c) a combination of the two scenarios. All three scenarios were compared with current practice. The scenarios were chosen as feasible options available for Hungary based on the outcome of interviews with local stakeholders. Life-time costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from a health-care perspective. The analyses used various return on investment (ROI) estimates, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), to compare the scenarios. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the extent to which the estimated mean ICERs were sensitive to the model input values.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Introducing a social marketing campaign resulted in an increase of 0.3014 additional quitters per 1 000 smokers, translating to health-care cost-savings of €0.6495 per smoker compared with current practice. When the value of QALY gains was considered, cost-savings increased to €14.1598 per smoker. Doubling the reach of existing group-based behavioural support therapies and proactive telephone support resulted in health-care savings of €0.2539 per smoker (€3.9620 with the value of QALY gains), compared with current practice. The respective figures for the combined scenario were €0.8960 and €18.0062. Results were sensitive to model input values.
    


          Conclusions:

"In many countries, health insurers or health plans choose to contract either with any willing providers or with preferred providers. We compare these mechanisms when two medical services are imperfect substitutes in demand and are supplied by two different firms. In both cases, the reimbursement is higher when patients select the in-network provider(s). We show that these mechanisms yield lower prices, lower providers' and insurer's profits, and lower expense than in the uniform-reimbursement case. Whatever the degree of product differentiation, a not-for-profit insurer should prefer selective contracting and select a reimbursement such that the out-of-pocket expense is null. Although all providers join the network under any-willing-provider contracting in the absence of third-party payment, an asymmetric equilibrium may exist when this billing arrangement is implemented.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29774623/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      The objective was to describe the resource use and costs due to predefined stages of nephropathy in diabetic patients and to evaluate its economical impact in Germany.
    


          Design and methods:
        
      
      In this retrospective, observational study information about socio-demographics, clinical characteristics and resource use on adult type 1 and type 2 patients with nephropathy in diabetic patients were collected from 23 general practitioners, 10 internists and 24 diabetologists, who were randomly selected from a physicians' database. Based on these results average costs per patient were evaluated for each complication stage from the societal perspective and the perspective of the health insurance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The costs due to nephropathy in diabetic patients increase dramatically with the progression of the disease. The main cost drivers were dialysis and hospitalization which accounted for 68% of the total costs due to nephropathy in diabetic patients. The total estimated costs related to nephropathy in diabetic patients were euro1332 (from the perspective of the health insurance) and euro2019 from the societal perspective.

"Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular since the introduction of bitcoin in 2009. In this paper, we identify factors associated with variations in cryptocurrencies' market values. In the past, researchers argued that the ""buzz"" surrounding cryptocurrencies in online media explained their price variations. But this observation obfuscates the notion that cryptocurrencies, unlike fiat currencies, are technologies entailing a true innovation potential. By using, for the first time, a unique measure of innovation potential, we find that the latter is in fact the most important factor associated with increases in cryptocurrency returns. By contrast, we find that the buzz surrounding cryptocurrencies is negatively associated with returns after controlling for a variety of factors, such as supply growth and liquidity. Also interesting is our finding that a cryptocurrency's association with fraudulent activity is not negatively associated with weekly returns-a result that further qualifies the media's influence on cryptocurrencies. Finally, we find that an increase in supply is positively associated with weekly returns. Taken together, our findings show that cryptocurrencies do not behave like traditional currencies or commodities-unlike what most prior research has assumed-and depict an industry that is much more mature, and much less speculative, than has been implied by previous accounts.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169556,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28085906/,economics
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer represents a significant financial burden to the population in the United States. Therapeutic advances in bladder cancer care have come at a high cost to payers, providers, and patients. This study describes the principals of cost-effectiveness evaluation in healthcare and provides recommendations for a more economical use of resources in bladder cancer care.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Although several studies have demonstrated that bladder cancer is a common disease associated with substantial economic burden for patients and society, the evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of many interventions in bladder cancer care is limited and of insufficient quality. In addition, very little is known about quality of life, the preferred outcome measure for economic evaluations, associated with bladder cancer states and treatments. Moreover, current clinical guidelines for bladder cancer care do not incorporate economic factors when evaluating clinical pathways.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Although cost-effectiveness studies in bladder cancer could allow us to know how healthcare dollars are being spent and assist in determining more effective ways to allocate resources, most of the currently used interventions have not undergone economic assessment.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0b013e32830b8910,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18670280/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Complications and comorbidities are encodable in the German diagnosis related groups (G-DRG) system and can improve revenues. In this study, secondary diagnoses were identified through drug administrations during anaesthesia and were economically evaluated by regrouping these cases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All intraoperative drug administrations from 2008 were extracted from a database. After exclusion of synonyms and procedure-specific drug administrations, all remaining drugs were matched to explicit secondary diagnoses. All cases were regrouped with their newly defined secondary diagnoses by G‑DRG grouper software, and changes in cost weight were evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 29 drugs could be assigned to 18 secondary diagnoses. From 22,440 anaesthesia the § 21 data record could be extracted in 1,929 cases and was regrouped with 2,976 secondary diagnoses, according to additional proceeds of 125,330.25 € in 2008 and 103,542.35 € in 2014. Intraoperative secondary diagnoses influence cost weight only in small parts. The average increase in revenue in this study could have been about 50 € per case. From 2008 to 2014 secondary diagnoses were continuously devaluated, although some of them, e. g. afibrinogenemia, have were revaluated.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our retrospective method of making a diagnosis and assuming a correct indication of drug administration is inapplicable to daily routine. The anaesthesiologic documentation has to make drug administration and thereby the secondary diagnosis plausible.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-016-0172-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27221390/,economics
"This article examines (i) the background and debate over cost shifting; (ii) hospitals as business institutions that often shift the financial responsibility for their costs in the form of differential pricing; and (iii) how the cost-shifting debate affects and is affected by Medicare. The aim is to gain a better understanding of how changes in reimbursement by large government health insurance programmes affect hospital behaviour. The article argues that the controversy over cost shifting is becoming an increasingly important issue for hospitals in the US and their ability (or willingness) to provide uncompensated charity care. The issue has also become very important for workers and their dependants. This is because workers have shouldered the largest portion of the dramatic growth in healthcare costs that have occurred in the US in recent years, due in large part to increased cost shifting (or 'sharing of financial responsibility') from their employers.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00148365-200403030-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15740171/,economics
"The decision-making and policy formation context in Iceland has been largely devoid of total economic valuations in cost-benefit assessments. Using an internet survey and applying the double bounded dichotomous choice methodology, this contingent valuation study sets out an estimate of the total economic value pertaining to Heiðmörk, a popular recreational area of urban open space located on the fringes of Reykjavík, Garðabær and Kópavogur. In so doing, this case study advances the practice of using non-market valuation techniques in the country. The welfare estimates provide evidence that Icelanders consider Heiðmörk to possess considerable total economic value, with taxpayers willing to pay a mean lump-sum tax in the range 17,039 to 24,790 ISK per payment to secure its preservation, equating to an estimated total economic value of between 5.87 and 35.47 billion ISK. In the light of possible competitive land management demands among Heiðmörk's three owners and many recreational users in the future, the establishment of these values and their potential use in cost-benefit assessments informs the debate concerning whether the area should be preserved or further developed to satisfy economic objectives. Additionally, a body of experimental evidence is formed suggesting that the increased duration of a fixed payment vehicle is associated with much higher total economic valuations compared to a one-year payment period.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.045,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29288935/,economics

Furthermore, it evaluates whether their views on patents and public goods clashed with the interests of RAND, at which both Arrow and Coase worked at some point during this time period.

"Pharmaceutical expenditure has increased rapidly across many Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries over the past three decades. This growth is an increasing concern for governments and other third-party payers seeking to provide equitable and comprehensive healthcare within sustainable budgets. In order to create headroom for increasing utilisation, and to fund new high-cost therapies, there is an active push to 'disinvest' from low-value drugs. The aim of this article is to review how reimbursement policy decision makers have sought to partially or completely disinvest from drugs in a range of OECD countries (UK, France, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) where they are publicly funded or subsidised. We employed a systematic literature search strategy and the incorporation of grey literature known to the authorship team. We canvass key policy instruments from each country to outline key approaches to the identification of candidate drugs for disinvestment assessment (passive approaches vs. more active approaches); methods of disinvestment and value-based purchasing (de-listing, restricting treatment, price or reimbursement rate reductions, encouraging generic prescribing); lessons learnt from the various approaches; the potential role of coverage with evidence development; and the need for careful stakeholder management. Dedicated sections are provided with detailed coverage of policy approaches (with drug examples) from each country. Historically, countries have relied on 'passive disinvestment'; however, due to (1) the availability of new cost-effectiveness evidence, or (2) 'leakage' in drug utilisation, or (3) market failure in terms of price competition, there is an increasing focus towards 'active disinvestment'. Isolating low-value drugs that would create headroom for innovative new products to enter the market is also motivating disinvestment efforts by multiple parties, including industry. Historically, disinvestment has mainly taken the form of price reductions, especially when market failures are perceived to exist, and restricting treatment to subpopulations, particularly when a drug is no longer considered value for money. There is considerable experimentation internationally in mechanisms for disinvestment and the opportunity for countries to learn from each other. Ongoing evaluation of disinvestment strategies is essential, and ought to be reported in the peer-reviewed literature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-015-0293-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26048353/,economics
"Pharmacogenetics (PGx) has the potential to personalize pharmaceutical treatments. Many relevant gene-drug associations have been discovered, but PGx-guided treatment needs to be cost-effective as well as clinically beneficial to be incorporated into standard health-care. We reviewed economic evaluations for PGx associations listed in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling. We determined the proportion of evaluations that found PGx-guided treatment to be cost-effective or dominant over the alternative strategies, and estimated the impact on this proportion of removing the cost of genetic testing. Of the 137 PGx associations in the FDA table, 44 economic evaluations, relating to 10 drugs, were identified. Of these evaluations, 57% drew conclusions in favour of PGx testing, of which 30% were cost-effective and 27% were dominant (cost-saving). If genetic information was freely available, 75% of economic evaluations would support PGx-guided treatment, of which 25% would be cost-effective and 50% would be dominant. Thus, PGx-guided treatment can be a cost-effective and even a cost-saving strategy. Having genetic information readily available in the clinical health record is a realistic future prospect, and would make more genetic tests economically worthwhile.",https://doi.org/10.1038/tpj.2017.21,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28607506/,economics
"The Medicare program faces a serious challenge: it must find ways to control costs but must do so through a system of congressional oversight that necessarily limits its choices. We look at one approach to prudent purchasing - competitive pricing - that Medicare has attempted many times and in various ways since the beginning of the program, and in all but one case unsuccessfully due to the politics of provider opposition working through Congress and the courts. We look at some related efforts to change Medicare pricing to explore when the program has been successful in making dramatic changes in how it pays for health care. A set of recommendations emerges for ways to respond to the impediments of law and politics that have obstructed change to more efficient payment methods. Except in unusual cases, competitive pricing threatens too many stakeholders in too many ways for key political actors to support it. But an unusual case may arise in the coming Medicare fiscal crisis, a crisis related in part to the prices Medicare pays. At that point, competitive pricing may look less like a problem and more like a solution coming at a time when the system badly needs one.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-1334677,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21730213/,economics
"Health expenditure data are known to be afflicted by restricted range, zero values, skewness and kurtosis. Several methods for modelling such data have been suggested in the literature to cope with these problems. This paper compares the performance of several alternative estimators, including two-part models and generalised linear models. The dependent variable is household expenditure on health care in Greece, a country where out-of-pocket health expenditure is higher than anywhere else in the European Union, whether as a proportion of GDP, as a share of all health spending, or in per capita terms. To facilitate comparison of model performance, household health expenditure is examined in two different specifications: expenditure on all health care (where zero values are rare) and expenditure on hospital services alone (where zero values are common). In the case of expenditure on all health care, three of the estimators performed almost equally well in terms of three alternative model performance indicators: a modified two-part model with non-linear least squares in the second part, a constant-variance generalised linear model and a variance-proportional-to-mean generalised linear model. In the case of expenditure on hospital services, the constant-variance generalised linear model out-performed the rest. The findings suggest that no estimator is best under all circumstances, while most alternative estimators are likely to produce relatively similar results. The paper concludes by discussing implications for further research.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-008-0137-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19037671/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      This article outlines the budgetary setting within the UK health-care system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      It is argued that while prospective budgets can give rise to efficient resource allocation outcomes, this relies on the budget being set at an appropriate level and the accompanying incentive structures being efficient. The organizational structures and the interrelationships are critical. The recent history of UK National Health Service reforms and expenditure is outlined. It is suggested that until recently, although the budget system has the potential to promote efficiency, the aggregate budget allocated to the NHS has probably been too low given public expectations, technology advances, and preferences for health care.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The aggregate budget is due to rise considerably over the next 5 years. While some incentive and regulatory provisions will move the budget toward an efficient allocation many microlevel incentive issues remain.

      Whether efficient patterns of health-care allocation emerge remains open to debate, however, because the existing incentive mechanisms are not optimal.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1524-4733.6.s1.7.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12846927/,economics
"One of the most important and complex decisions that public services managers have to make is pricing. This is especially difficult within public health care because pricing decisions are influenced by a myriad of ideological, political, economic and professional arguments. In Turkey the majority of health care services are provided under public auspice; however, recent changes in governmental policy have led to increased competition among hospitals in both the public and private sector. Therefore, all institutions are being watched and remain open to government scrutiny and regulation. The aim of the study is to analyze how the private and governmental hospitals determine pricing or the actual cost of services in Turkey. Also, comparisons are made between health services expenditures and the Consumer Price Index with suggestions provided for public and private hospital managers in regard to the general cost of health services.",https://doi.org/10.1300/j026v17n04_02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11183658/,economics
"Despite growing concern with cost containment, most health policy analysts have ignored vast potential savings on medically irrelevant spending for excess administration, profits, high physician incomes, marketing, and legal involvement in medicine. Indeed, many recent reforms encourage administrative hypertrophy, entrepreneurialism and litigation. A universal national health program could abolish billing and consequently the need for much of the administrative apparatus of health care, and decrease spending for profits and marketing. In this article we analyze the administrative savings that could be realized from instituting a Canadian-style national health insurance program or a national health service similar to that in Britain, and the potential savings from additional reforms to curtail profits, marketing and litigation. Our calculations based on 1983 data suggest that national health insurance would save $42.6 billion annually: $29.2 billion on health administration and insurance overhead, $4.9 billion on profits, $3.9 billion on marketing, and $4.6 billion on physician's incomes. A national health service would save $65.8 billion: $38.4 billion on health administration and insurance overhead, $4.9 billion on profits, $3.9 billion on marketing, and $18.6 billion on physician's incomes. Complete nationalization of all health related industries and reform of the malpractice system would save at least $87.2 billion per year. We conclude that a national health program, in addition to improving access to health care for the oppressed, could achieve cost containment without rationing of care.",https://doi.org/10.2190/03fk-fn53-2p5b-erd5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3089955/,economics
"Economic evaluations are an important input to decision-making and priority-setting in the health care sector. Measuring preferences for health improvements, as the demand-side value (willingness to pay) of gaining a quality-adjusted life year (QALY), is one relevant component in the interpretation of the results from health economic evaluations. Our article addresses whether willingness to pay for a QALY (WTP-Q) is sensitive to the size of the health differences and the probability for improvement. We use data from a contingent valuation survey based on 1400 respondents conducted in the spring of 2014. The results show that the expectation of sensitivity to scope, or higher WTP to the larger expected quality of life improvement, is not supported. We find WTP-Q values that conform reasonably well to previous studies in Sweden.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-017-0929-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28932914/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Most societies elaborate ways to contain increasing health care expenditures. In Switzerland out of pocket payments and cuts in the catalogue of reimbursed services are used as cost-containment measures. The aims of the study were to estimate the extent of health care renunciation for economic reasons and to identify associated factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A population-based cross-sectional survey (2008-2009) of a representative sample in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Health care underuse, income level categories (<CHF 3000/month, 3000-4999, 5000-6999, 7000-9499, 9500-13000, >13000), education, occupation, insurance status and cardiovascular comorbidities were collected using self-rated questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      765 men and 814 women aged 35-74 years participated. 14.5% (229/1579) (95% CI 12.7-16.2) renounced health care for economic reasons. Among those who renounced (N=229), 74% renounced dental care, 37% physician consultation (22% specialist, 15% general practitioner), 26% health devices, 13% medication, and 5% surgery. Income was negatively correlated with renouncement (r=-0.18, p<.0001). Each decrease in income level category provided a 48% increased risk of renouncing health care for economic reasons (OR 1.48, 1.31-1.65). This association remained when dental care was excluded from the definition of health care renunciation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In a region of Switzerland with a high cost of living, such as Geneva, socioeconomic status may influence the use of the health care system, and renunciation for economic reasons was not uncommon. More than 30% of the lowest income group renounced health care for economical reasons in the previous year. Health care underuse and renunciation may worsen the health status of a substantial part of society.",https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2011.13165,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21337175/,economics
"Management information systems (MIS) and decision support systems (DSS), used as part of broader healthcare technology management, are considered to be health technologies. As such, they should meet the criteria of affordability, appropriateness, cost-effectiveness, ease of use and sustainability if they are to be implementable and have a lasting impact on healthcare service delivery. They should also facilitate and support improved quality of healthcare. We have developed a suite of management-support tools around a concept of integrated healthcare resource planning and management (iHRPM). We believe that these tools meet the above-mentioned criteria and therefore lend themselves to widespread applicability in diverse healthcare and socio-economic contexts, not least in supporting performance monitoring and benchmarking.",https://doi.org/10.1109/iembs.2006.259646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17947143/,economics
"Widespread indications for use of molecular diagnostics in various aspects of clinical medicine have driven proliferation of testing. The rapid adoption and continuous technological evolution of molecular diagnostics have often strained the development and maintenance of a functional underlying framework of coding, coverage, and reimbursement policies, thereby presenting challenges to various stakeholders, including molecular professionals, payers, and patients. A multidisciplinary working group convened by the Association for Molecular Pathology Economic Affairs Committee was tasked to describe the complex landscape of molecular pathology economics and highlight opportunities for member engagement. In this article, on the basis of review and synthesis of government regulations and procedures, published payer policy documents, peer-reviewed literature, and expert consensus, the Working Group navigates the ecosystem of molecular pathology economics in terms of stakeholders, coding systems and processes, coverage policy determination, and pricing mechanisms. The composition and interrelatedness of various working groups and committees are emphasized to highlight the functional underpinnings of the system. Molecular professionals must be conversant in the language and complex inner workings of molecular pathology economics to lead successful, viable laboratories and advocate effectively for policy development on their behalf.

"The introduction of the new law GKV-FQWG strengthens the competition between statutory health insurance. If incentives for risk selection exist, they may force a battle for cheap customers. This study aims to document and discuss incentives for regional risk selection in the German risk structure compensation scheme. Identify regional autocorrelation with Moran's l on financial parameters of the risk structure compensation schema. Incentives for regional risk selection do indeed exist. The risk structure compensation schema reduces 91% of the effect and helps to reduce risk selection. Nevertheless, a connection between regional situation and competition could be shown (correlation: 69.5%). Only the integration of regional control variables into the risk compensation eliminates regional autocorrelation. The actual risk structure compensation is leading to regional inequalities and as a consequence to risk selection and distortion in competition.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-123851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28329873/,economics

"Opportunity costs of bed-days are fundamental to understanding the value of healthcare systems. They greatly influence burden of disease estimations and economic evaluations involving stays in healthcare facilities. However, different estimation techniques employ assumptions that differ crucially in whether to consider the value of the second-best alternative use forgone, of any available alternative use, or the value of the actually chosen alternative. Informed by economic theory, this paper provides a taxonomic framework of methodologies for estimating the opportunity costs of resources. This taxonomy is then applied to bed-days by classifying existing approaches accordingly. We highlight differences in valuation between approaches and the perspective adopted, and we use our framework to appraise the assumptions and biases underlying the standard approaches that have been widely adopted mostly unquestioned in the past, such as the conventional use of reference costs and administrative accounting data. Drawing on these findings, we present a novel approach for estimating the opportunity costs of bed-days in terms of health forgone for the second-best patient, but expressed monetarily. This alternative approach effectively re-connects to the concept of choice and explicitly considers net benefits. It is broadly applicable across settings and for other resources besides bed-days.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29105894/,economics

Controlling is contributing to evaluate an optimal efficiency of a hospital in a highly competitive surrounding by providing medical and economical data on a regular basis.

The analysis suggests that the recent revisions in the Medicare payment system have less potential to contain increases in total hospital costs than those embodied in all-payer systems. In addition, this paper also suggests that the pricing mechanism will jeopardize the financial viability of many hospitals while exacerbating inequities that emanate from differential pricing policies. Finally, when viewed from the perspective of insured beneficiaries, it is reasonable to expect that the payment mechanism will reduce not only access to inpatient care but also the use of service once admitted.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(85)90196-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3927487/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      We assessed change in household catastrophic health care expenditures (CHE) and inequality in facing such expenditures in south-west Tehran.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cluster-sampled survey was conducted in 2003 using the World Health Survey questionnaire. We repeated the survey on the same sample in 2008 (635 and 603 households, respectively). We estimated the proportion of households facing CHE using the 'household's capacity to pay'. We identified the determinants of the household CHE using regression analysis and used the concentration index to measure socio-economic inequality and decompose it into its determinants factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Findings showed that the proportion of household facing CHE had no significant change in this period (12.6% in 2003 vs 11.8% in 2008). The key determinants of CHE for both years were health care utilization and health care insurance status. Socio-economic status was the main contributor to inequality in CHE, while unequal utilization of dentistry and outpatient services had reduced the inequality in CHE between socio-economic groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We observed no significant change in the CHE proportion despite policy interventions aimed at reducing such expenditures. Any solution to the problem of CHE should include interventions aimed at the determinants of CHE.

"The purpose of this article is to introduce elements of the capitalist society economic reproduction to the discussion around the current dynamics of health accumulation. It identifies the direction and significance of capital accumulation in the health area as well as the characteristics of the economic environment where the competition currently takes place. The hypothetic hypertrophy of the financial sphere is seen as a means for structuring the capitalist economy since the late twentieth century. The former delimitations between industrial production and service delivery are blurred and weakened; the competition process shows new features and the contradictions - internally between the different elements of the health industry and externally with other sectors - are changing. This article aggregates elements for a contemporary analysis of the ""medical-industrial complex"" on the basis of a theoretical-historical-conceptual approach. We identify changes in the capital dynamics of this complex at international and national level and stress the increasing role of the health services as a forefront of capital accumulation. The new approach is based on the economic thinking of Marx in addition to the current discussions about the theory of financial capital accumulation and the new productive configurations of the large corporations.",https://doi.org/10.1590/s1413-81232008000500007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18813644/,economics
"Biodiversity policies in the European Union (EU) are mainly implemented through the Birds and Habitats Directives as well as the establishment of Natura 2000, a network of protected areas throughout the EU. Considerable resources must be allocated for fulfilling the Directives and the question of optimal allocation is as important as it is difficult. In general, economic evaluations of conservation targets at most consider the costs and seldom the welfare economic benefits. In the present study, we use welfare economic benefit estimates concerning the willingness-to-pay for preserving endangered species and for the aggregate area of heathland preserved in Denmark. Similarly, we obtain estimates of the welfare economic cost of habitat restoration and maintenance. Combining these welfare economic measures with expected species coverage, we are able to estimate the potential welfare economic contribution of a conservation network. We compare three simple nonprobabilistic strategies likely to be used in day-to-day policy implementation: i) a maximum selected area strategy, ii) a hotspot selection strategy, and iii) a minimizing cost strategy, and two more advanced and informed probabilistic strategies: i) a maximum expected coverage strategy and ii) a strategy for maximum expected welfare economic gain. We show that the welfare economic performance of the strategies differ considerably. The comparison between the expected coverage and expected welfare shows that for the case considered, one may identify an optimal protection level above which additional coverage only comes at increasing welfare economic loss.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-006-0221-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17906890/,economics
"As geographic limitation has gradually vanished, many economic activities occurred with apparent spillover on the neighboring regions. To study other social pressures on energy consumption considering spatial spillover effects, this paper constructs STIRPAT spatial model to investigate the relationship among energy intensity, foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth, population scale, and technology progress in the case of 30 provinces in China over the period of 2001-2016. Spatial correlation test methodologies are applied, and STIRPAT spatial Durbin model (SDM) is preferred to describe the pushing-in and pushing-out effects among regions. We find that there is obvious spatial spillover of energy intensity; economic growth, industrial development, and population scale positively relate to energy intensity in local regions; technology progress is an effective way for energy conservation; the spillover effects of global domestic production (GDP), population size, and technology in adjacent regions are significant on local energy consumption; in China, FDI inflows into the local and neighboring regions negatively affect energy intensity, indicating that FDI would release the pressure of energy consumption.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06401-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31630350/,economics

These broader impacts include, for instance, the effects on the labor market and productivity, education, criminal justice, housing, consumption, and environment. The current pandemic highlights the importance of adopting a societal perspective to consider these broader impacts of public health issues and interventions and only omit these where it can be clearly justified as appropriate to do so. Furthermore, we explain how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing deep-rooted structural inequalities that contribute to the wider societal impacts of the pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462321000155,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33686927/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To test whether underwriting modifies the effect of state-based incentives on individuals' purchase of long-term care insurance.
    


          Data source:
        
      
      Health and Retirement Study (HRS), 1996-2012.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      We estimated difference-in-difference regression models with an interaction of state policy indicators with individuals' probabilities of being approved for long-term care insurance.
    


          Data extraction:
        
      
      We imputed probabilities of underwriting approval for respondents in the HRS using a model developed with underwriting decisions from two U.S. insurance firms. We measured the elasticity response to long-term care insurance price using changes in simulated after-tax price as an instrumental variable for premium price.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      Tax incentives and Partnership programs increased insurance purchase by 3.62 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, among those with the lowest risk (highest approval probability). Neither had any statistically significant effects among the highest risk individuals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We show that ignoring the effects of underwriting may lead to biased estimates of the potential state budget savings of long-term care insurance tax incentives.

Some examples include the advent of Medicare's Prospective Payment System, growth in managed care options, relaxation of states' Certificate of Need (CON) regulations, and court cases questioning the tax-exempt status of nonprofit hospitals. In this paper we attempt to reveal how hospitals alter their provision of care to the poor in a more cost conscious and competitive environment. Using hospital data from the State of California for the fiscal years ending in 1983 and 1987, estimates explaining uncompensated care commitments are presented. In particular, this study illustrates how hospitals under different ownership control varied their provision of uncompensated care over the period studied on average and by profitability level. Other factors, such as hospital location, teaching status, medicare patient load, and contractual adjustments, are also included in the analysis. A number of interesting trends are detected. Moreover, the results are found to be compatible with a quid pro quo hypothesis which states that hospital regulators reward large uncompensated care providers with profitable CON licenses.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4730020311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8275173/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To identify pharmaceutical policy changes during the economic recession in eight European countries and to determine whether policy measures resulted in lower sales of, and less expenditure on, pharmaceuticals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Information on pharmaceutical policy changes between 2008 and 2011 in eight European countries was obtained from publications and pharmaceutical policy databases. Data on the volume and value of the quarterly sales of products between 2006 and 2011 in the 10 highest-selling therapeutic classes in each country were obtained from a pharmaceutical market research database. We compared these indicators in economically stable countries; Austria, Estonia and Finland, to those in economically less stable countries, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Economically stable countries implemented two to seven policy changes each, whereas less stable countries implemented 10 to 22 each. Of the 88 policy changes identified, 33 occurred in 2010 and 40 in 2011. They involved changing out-of-pocket payments for patients in 16 cases, price mark-up schemes in 13 and price cuts in 11. Sales volumes increased moderately in all countries except Greece and Portugal, which experienced slight declines after 2009. Sales values decreased in both groups of countries, but fell more in less stable countries.

Unexpectedly, pharmaceutical sales volumes increased in almost all countries, whereas sales values declined, especially in less stable countries.",https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.13.129114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25378754/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate patterns of competition among hospitals for the business of health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The study focused on the relative importance of hospital price and nonprice attributes in the competition for HMO business.
    


          Data sources/study setting:
        
      
      The study capitalized on hospital cost reports from Florida that are unique in their inclusion of financial data regarding HMO business activity. The time frame was 1992 to 1997.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      The study was designed as an observational investigation of acute care hospitals.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      Results indicated that a hospital's share of HMO business was related to both its price and nonprice attributes. However, the importance of both price and nonprice attributes diminished as the number of HMOs in a market increased. Hospitals that were market share leaders in terms of HMO business (i.e., 30 percent or more market share) were superior, on average, to their competitors on both price and nonprice attributes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Study results indicate that competition among hospitals for HMO business involves a complex set of price and nonprice attributes. The HMOs do not appear to focus on price alone. Hospitals likely to be the most attractive to HMOs are those that can differentiate themselves on the basis of nonprice attributes while being competitive on price as well.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.01088,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479496/,economics
"Study question:
        
      
      What is the economic burden of endometriosis?
    


          Summary answer:
        
      
      The identified studies indicate that there is a significant economic burden associated with endometriosis, as observed by both direct and indirect costs.
    


          What is known already:
        
      
      Two previous systematic literature reviews suggested that there were considerable direct costs associated with endometriosis and there was a general lack of measurement of indirect costs.
    


          Study design, size, duration:
        
      
      We performed a systematic literature review. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 2000 to 2013 were searched. The literature search was limited to human studies of patients with endometriosis. Papers in languages other than English were excluded.
    


          Participants/materials, setting, methods:
        
      
      Studies reporting direct or indirect costs among patients with endometriosis were considered for inclusion. Direct costs included inpatient, outpatient, surgery, drug and other healthcare service cost. Indirect costs were related to absenteeism and presenteeism (lost productivity at work).
    


          Main results and the role of chance:
        
      
      After evaluating the 1396 articles in the search results, 12 primary studies that reported direct or indirect costs associated with endometriosis were identified and included in the data extraction. Three of the studies were conducted in the USA, one study each was conducted in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, Germany and Italy, and two studies included data from 10 countries. Significant variability was observed in the reviewed studies in methodology, including data source, cost components considered and study perspective. Estimates of total direct costs ranged from $1109 per patient per year in Canada to $12 118 per patient per year in the USA. Indirect costs of endometriosis ranged from $3314 per patient per year in Austria to $15 737 per patient per year in the USA.
    


          Limitations, reasons for caution:
        
      
      The studies identified in the systematic literature review varied greatly by study methodology as well as by country owing to different healthcare systems and costs of healthcare services, which contributed to large variations in the direct and indirect cost estimates.
    


          Wider implications of the findings:
        
      
      A majority of the studies we found were published after the periods covered in the prior systematic literature reviews, which provided substantial contributions to an understanding of the economic burden of endometriosis, especially in the area of indirect costs. The long-term burden of endometriosis following diagnosis is still under-studied, which is a concern given the chronic nature of the disease and the substantial recurrence of endometriosis symptoms.
    


          Study funding/competing interests:

"Health-care expenditure regressions are used in a wide variety of economic analyses including risk adjustment and program and treatment evaluations. Recent articles demonstrated that generalized gamma models (GGMs) and extended estimating equations (EEE) models provide flexible approaches to deal with a variety of data problems encountered in expenditure estimation. To date there have been few empirical applications of these models to expenditures. We use data from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to compare the bias, predictive accuracy, and marginal effects of GGM and EEE models with other commonly used regression models in a cross-validation study design. Health-care expenditure distributions vary in the degree of heteroskedasticity, skewness, and kurtosis by type of service and population. To examine the ability of estimators to address a range of data problems, we estimate models of total health expenditures and prescription drug expenditures for two populations, the elderly and privately insured adults. Our findings illustrate the need for researchers to examine their assumptions about link functions: the appropriate link function varies across our four distributions. The EEE model, which has a flexible link function, is a robust estimator that performs as well, or better, than the other models in each distribution.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1498,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19434646/,economics
"Importance:
        
      
      Several states have passed surprise-billing legislation to protect patients from unanticipated out-of-network medical bills, yet little is known about how state laws influence out-of-network prices and whether spillovers exist to in-network prices.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To identify any changes in prices paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities and to in-network anesthesiologists before and after states passed surprise-billing legislation.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This retrospective economic analysis used difference-in-differences methods to compare price changes before and after the passage of legislation in California, Florida, and New York, which passed comprehensive surprise-billing legislation between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017, to 45 states that did not. Commercial claims data from the Health Care Cost Institute were used to identify prices paid to anesthesiologists in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers. The final analytic sample comprised 2 713 913 anesthesia claims across the 3 treated states and the 45 control states.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Temporal and state-level variation in exposure to surprise-billing legislation.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The unit price (allowed amounts standardized per unit of service) paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities and to in-network anesthesiologists.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This retrospective economic analysis of 2 713 913 anesthesia claims found that after surprise-billing laws were passed in 3 states, the unit price paid to out-of-network anesthesiologists at in-network facilities decreased significantly in 2 of them: California, -$12.71 (95% CI, -$25.70 to -$0.27; P = .05) and Florida, -$35.67 (95% CI, -$46.27 to -$25.07; P < .001). In New York, a decline in the overall out-of-network price was not statistically significant (-$7.91; 95% CI, -$17.48 to -$1.68; P = .10); however, by the fourth quarter of 2017, the decline was -$41.28 (95% CI, -$70.24 to -$12.33; P = .01). In-network prices decreased in California by -$10.68 (95% CI, -$12.70 to -$8.66; P < .001); in Florida, -$3.18 (95% CI, -$5.17 to -$1.19; P = .002); and in New York, -$8.05 (95% CI, -$11.46 to -$4.64; P < .001).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      This retrospective study found that prices paid to in-network and out-of-network anesthesiologists in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers decreased after the introduction of surprise-billing legislation, providing early insights into how prices may change under the federal No Surprises Act and in states that have recently passed their own legislation.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.4564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34398193/,economics

"Pharmaceutical spending in the United States, Canada, and the EU is growing. Public payers cover a large portion of these costs and have responded by instituting various pricing and access policies to limit their expenditure. One challenge that public payers face is additional demand induced by a manufacturer's marketing effort. We use a game theoretic approach to study the impact of pharmaceutical marketing on six practical pricing and access policies: negotiated pricing, open pricing, controlled pricing, a listing process, a risk-sharing arrangement, and a value-based pricing with risk-sharing arrangement. We find that all non-value-based policies result in either restricted access or suboptimal treatment coverage. We find that marketing is the highest in the first-best setting where all decisions are made by a social planner. We also find that the value-based pricing with risk-sharing arrangement is preferred by the manufacturer and from a societal perspective whereas no policy is universally preferred by a health care payer. A value-based pricing with risk-sharing arrangement always results in zero net monetary benefit for a health care payer. Therefore, considering non-value-based arrangements, we find that a negotiated pricing policy, a controlled pricing policy, or a risk-sharing arrangement may be socially preferred.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31310424/,economics

This article discusses the role insurance can play in adapting to climate change impacts. The particular focus is on the Dutch insurance sector, in view of the Netherlands being extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts. The usefulness of private insurance as an adaptation instrument to increased flood risks is examined, which is currently unavailable in the Netherlands. It is questioned whether the currently dominant role of the Dutch government in providing damage relief is justified from an economic efficiency perspective. Characteristics of flood insurance arrangements in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France are compared in order to identify possible future directions for arrangements in the Netherlands.

"This paper estimates the relationship between Medicare fees and quantities provided by physicians for eight specific services. It uses data for 13,707 physicians who responded to surveys in 2000/2001 and/or 2004/2005 and were linked to all Medicare claims for their Medicare patients. Results show that Medicare fees are positively related to quantity provided for all eight services, and are significantly different from zero and elastic for five of them. The findings are consistent with the general economic proposition that supply curves for medical services are positively sloped, and provide no evidence of volume-offset behavior for the services examined. These results also imply that Medicare could influence volume growth for specific services by varying their fee changes, and that uniform fee changes will have differential effects on service volume because of variation in underlying supply elasticities.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_46.4.372,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20184165/,economics

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will provide temporary relief, although it introduced some new problems, including its geographic adjustment of Medicare+Choice rates. For the future we propose a premium-support system and an expanded benefits package. Such a system would provide a more flexible means to adjust the division of the financing burden between the elderly and the nonelderly, potentially gain some efficiencies from greater price competition and less reliance on administered pricing, and partly address the issue of uninsured early retirees.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.18.1.92,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9926648/,economics
"Pharmacoeconomics is a branch of health economics related to the most economical and efficient use of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacoeconomic research identifies, measures and compares the costs and outcomes (clinical, economic and humanistic) of pharmaceutical products and services. Pharmacoeconomic evaluation can play a significant role in the efficient allocation of resources in healthcare systems with constrained budgets. Countries are trying to control the rising costs of health care in their aging population. They are all asking the same question: Is the new drug good value for money; and if so, what is the society willing to pay for it? This article reviews the importance of, and the need for, adaptation of pharmacoeconomic analysis to the conditions in Saudi Arabia. It will shed some light on the important steps for converting the concept into practice, including the need for identifying the willing-to-pay (WTP) or the threshold cutoff, the existence of a real cost for each utility, the nonexistence of an pharmacoeconomic advisory forum, pharmaceutical budget allocation, and the impact of pharmaceutical marketing.

"Responses of 423 freshmen and 410 seniors at Jefferson Medical College in 1980-81 and 1982-83 to 15 questions on economic aspects of the health care system were compared. A majority of the students considered the cost of medical care, the cost of medical education, malpractice claims, and the failure of individuals to assume responsibility for their health to be major problems. A majority of the seniors also considered excessive government influence on the financing of medical care a major problem. More freshmen than seniors favored national health insurance and health maintenance organizations. More seniors than freshmen supported the professional standards review organization concept and action to discourage increases in the supply of physicians. Concern about the number of physicians entering the profession increased among seniors between 1981 and 1983. The data suggest that at graduation the students were more concerned about the position of physicians but might not be more informed about important aspects of the functioning of the health care system than they were at entry.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-198506000-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4040174/,economics
"This paper examines the economic foundations for mandatory discounts for insurers based on differences in bad debts experience. It considers critically the arguments Blue Cross plans use in several states. On both equity and efficiency grounds, discounts for actual bad debts are shown to be inappropriate. In contrast, it is shown that there are equity and efficiency reasons to grant a discount for insurance policies which avert bad debt, but that the appropriate discount is less than the amount of bad debt averted. The appropriate discount depends on the size of the subsidy needed to bring about purchase of debt-averting coverage. In some circumstances, this subsidy equals the underwriting loss on the coverage minus any tax subsidy the insurer receives.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-11-1-67,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3522724/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      To review cost-of-illness studies (COI) and economic evaluations (EE) conducted for medically unexplained symptoms and to analyze their methods and results.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We searched the databases PubMed, PsycINFO and National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database of the University of York. Cost data were inflated to 2006 using country-specific gross domestic product inflators and converted to 2006 USD purchasing power parities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 5 COI and 8 EE, of which 6 were cost-minimization analyses and 2 were cost-effectiveness analyses. All studies used patient level data collected between 1980 and 2004 and were predominantly conducted in the USA (n = 10). COI found annual excess health care costs of somatizing patients between 432 and 5,353 USD in 2006 values. Indirect costs were estimated by only one EE and added up to about 18,000 USD per year. In EE, educational interventions for physicians as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy approaches for patients were evaluated. For both types of interventions, effectiveness was either shown within EE or by previous studies. Most EE found (often insignificant) cost reductions resulting from the interventions, but only two studies explicitly combined changes in costs with data on effectiveness to cost-effectiveness ratios (ratio of additional costs to additional effects).
    


          Conclusions:

"Background:
        
      
      The management of the large patient population in Italy receiving long-term oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) poses organizational challenges that are traditionally approached with a centralized procedure, relying on hospital-based clinics and/or GPs. However, the availability of near-patient testing devices for the monitoring of OAT effectiveness (international normalized ratio measurement) allows for alternative or complementary management models, in which adequately trained patients perform the test themselves and possibly make decisions about dosing adjustments (patient self-monitoring). Patient self-monitoring has been proven to be effective and safe, and is economically attractive. However, in order to assess its potential economic impact in Italy, there is a need for data on current treatment patterns and relative costs, which are currently not available.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To establish prevalent management patterns and costs incurred by Italian OAT patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An ad hoc questionnaire was developed and administered to OAT patients with the support of the main Italian OAT patients association. Returned questionnaires were checked for consistency and valid data were summarized. Resources used were costed according to published prices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 4722 valid questionnaires were returned from all over Italy. The prevalent OAT management model in this sample relied on hospital-based anticoagulation clinics. Significant earning losses, transportation costs and other out-of-pocket expenses were incurred by patients, with an estimated mean overall monthly cost of approximately €30 (year 2008 value). There was a wide distribution of costs in this population, depending mainly on monitoring frequency, home-to-clinic distance and employment status.
    


          Conclusion:

"Postoperative complications will always occur and the negative impact puts strain on patients, relatives and the attending physicians. The conversion to a remuneration system based on flat rates (diagnosis-related groups) presents additional economic problems for hospitals in some resource-intensive treatments. This particularly pertains to extremely cost-intensive cases in which costs succeed revenue by the factor of 2 and are often surgical procedures. Here the economic risk increases with the number of interventions performed. Despite improvements in the remuneration system this problem persists. An improved payment for these treatments is desirable. To achieve this it is necessary to systematically analyze the extremely cost-intensive cases by experts of different medical disciplines to create a data basis for a proposal of a cost-covering payment.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00104-009-1693-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19636515/,economics
"Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are increasingly being utilised as anticoagulants in healthcare settings. These agents offer several advantages over standard unfractionated heparin. Indications for LMWHs include deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis treatment, use in coronary procedures associated with a high risk for bleeding, and in acute coronary syndromes. Prior to being added to formularies, LMWHs should be evaluated for efficacy, safety and economic benefits over other anticoagulants. Institutions should be prepared to conduct their own economic assessments in the absence of readily available studies. There is clear evidence that LMWHs are cost saving or are at least cost effective as thromboprophylactic agents in major orthopaedic surgery. The economic benefits of LMWHs in other surgical situations is less clear. Consistent evidence from several countries indicate that LMWHs are cost saving as anticoagulants for the initial treatment of DVT. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and economics of LMWHs in other conditions besides hip and knee arthroplasty and general surgery.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200017010-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10747761/,economics

Economic bubbles and crashes have occurred regularly through history -- from Holland's 17th century tulip mania, to America's 19th century railway mania, to the 1990s high-tech obsession. Though most investors regard themselves as investing rationally, few do. Instead they react collectively, buying high and selling low in crowds. Being subject to the illusion of control, they follow regressive behavior patterns and irrational, wishful thinking. They are victimized by their own emotions of hope, fear, and uncertainty. Crises happen often in economics. Indeed, the market itself may be quantified as a conglomeration of human sentiment.

"Many would tend to characterize modern society as steeped in complexity. This complexity is seen by a number of professional people to imply risk-taking--or risk-making--on a high level. ""A single mistake may give consequences of quite different proportions from earlier times,"" as one critic puts it. This hypothesis of increasing risks on a high level--of worst things getting worse--has been tested on fires in Sweden. Fire has always been a powerfully upsetting agent to the social fabric. Today industrial fires dominate the picture economically. The cost of industrial fires is about three times the cost of residential fires in Sweden. It is of interest to note that the damage cost of the worst fires (as measured in insurance payments) does not form an increasing part of overall fire damage costs, as one would expect from the above hypothesis. Whether the hypothesis holds with regard to indirect costs due to production stand-still is more uncertain. We can conclude that the potential of complexity to create large abnormal occurrences may have been somewhat prematurely announced--at least with regard to fires in Sweden.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.1991.tb00601.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1876724/,economics

This policy change had important economic effects on the distribution of income, taxation, and health care costs. This paper analyzes these economic effects by focusing on the changes in financial burden of medical care costs between 1969-70 and 1971-72 for eight income classes. The key results that emerge are: the total cost of medical care increases sharply for all of the income groups, and the burden of the cost of medical care becomes more equitable across the income groups.

"Objectives:
        
      
      The financial crisis of health insurance systems sometimes drives public policy-makers to take precipitate action dominated by economic imperatives. The question addressed here consists in defining homeopathy's scope of intervention, its place in health care strategies, recourse to treatment, and especially economic data appraising homeopathy's impact on expenditures and outlay covered by health insurance in France.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We used the General Evaluation Model to define the study (to whom is the evaluation made, situations, criteria, measurement of these criteria, quality and precision).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The main results are in terms of costs, as follows: * For reimbursable medicines the public sales price of homeopathic products is a quarter of the average. * The total reimbursement for a prescription of allopathic products is three times more than for a prescription of homeopathic products. * Homeopathic physicians incur annual reimbursement outlays which are half those of general practitioners. The differences observed cannot be explained by the patient profile or the diseases treated. Furthermore, a study carried out in France showed that 87% of patients whose physicians had prescribed homeopathic treatment did not see another physician for the same problem.

"Healthcare expenditures for cancer account for a low share of total healthcare expenditures, compared to the relative burden of the disease. The share has also not changed very much over the last decades. Cost for cancer drugs has increased as a share of total expenditures, but this has been offset by a reduction of inpatient hospital care for cancer. Accounting for the cost of cancer should not be limited to healthcare expenditures. Resources are also used for public and private care of cancer patients outside the healthcare sector, for example for palliative care. Informal care by family and friends is an important complement to professional care, and estimates indicate that this amounts to between half and one-third of the costs of formal care. Indirect costs related to the loss of production for persons with cancer are estimated to be of the same magnitude as the direct healthcare expenditures. Indirect costs related to premature mortality dominate the estimate of indirect costs, but those costs have declined over time, despite increasing incomes, due to the reduction in mortality due to cancer in the economically active age groups. Estimates of indirect costs due to morbidity are uncertain and vary significantly between published studies. A full accounting of the costs of cancer should include an estimate of the health burden of cancer. Loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) can be measured and valued based on the willingness to pay for a QALY. Such estimates are possible to derive from decisions about allocating resources for cancer. There are few estimates of these costs, but available studies indicate that the intangible costs of lost QALY are by far the dominating cost of cancer. The value for policy-making of costs of cancer estimates increases when results with consistent methods and data are available that allow comparisons between countries and over time. The evidence about the cost of cancer is still limited, but when current scientific progress produces an increasing number of new options for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, studies of the cost of cancer become increasingly important to inform decisions about resource allocation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01207-6_2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30543004/,economics

"Biosurfactants are surface-active molecules originated from renewable resources, which are produced by microbial fermentation or chemical/enzymatic catalysis. These molecules present important advantages as compared to petrochemical surfactants, given their resistance to extreme conditions, biodegradability, specificity, and environmental compatibility. Besides that, the high production costs hinder its commercialization. In this way, this article aimed to analyze microbial biosurfactants production, focusing on the optimization of metabolic pathways and production processes, to identify key aspects and provide alternatives to allow a cost-effective production at industrial scale. This was achieved by a broad analysis of biosurfactants properties, applications, and biosynthetic pathways (in terms of yield, cofactors, and energy), in addition to an assessment of production-associated costs. As a result of the present extensive data survey and analysis, key production aspects are disclosed. The metabolic pathway yield analysis demonstrated that production of biosurfactants can be significantly improved (highest theoretical yield was 0.47 gbiosurfactant /gsubstrate ) by the use of biomolecular engineering techniques to generate optimized synthetic pathways. With an alternative proposed pathway for surfactin, yield was improved and imbalance in cofactors and ATP was reduced. Analysis of productive costs indicated that to make rhamnolipids commercial production feasible, the main efforts should focus on lowering substrate costs as well as the identification of energy-efficient unit operations to lower electricity cost, since these parameters accounted for 19.36 and 78.22%, respectively, of the production costs. The data generated by this analysis highlight the need for multidisciplinary collaboration to make rhamnolipids economically feasible, including biomolecular engineering and process intensification.",https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.3093,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067929/,economics

The study is intended to contribute to a better allocation of resources under the trade-off-situation that only a limited number of integration projects can be realized due to budget limitations. This pilot study represents an economic evaluation of health activities on integration based on the example of study projects offered by Mudra e. V. As a result the study showed that the evaluated projects are economically advantageous during the investigated research period. Furthermore, the study contains a non-monetary analysis of intangible effects which shows significant improvements in quality of life.

"Population aging in Korea is projected to be the most rapid among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between 2000 and 2050. However, social spending in Korea remains low, reflecting Korea's relatively young population, limited health and long-term care insurance coverage, and immaturity of its pension system. As these factors evolve in coming years, social spending in Korea is likely to rise toward the OECD average. Sustaining economic growth requires policies to mitigate the impact of rapid population aging by providing social protection for the elderly population. Korea confronts difficult challenges in balancing economic growth and social protection for the elderly population, whereas also ensuring efficiency in social spending.",https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnt018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23528291/,economics
"Rationale:
        
      
      Stratified Medicine (SM) is becoming a natural result of advances in biomedical science and a promising path for the innovation-based biopharmaceutical industry to create new investment opportunities. While the use of biomarkers to improve R&D efficiency and productivity is very much acknowledged by industry, much work remains to be done to understand the drivers and conditions that favour using a stratified approach to create economically viable products and to justify the investment in SM interventions as a stratification option.
    


          Concept:
        
      
      In this paper we apply a decision analytical methodology to address the economic attractiveness of different SM development options in a cost-contained healthcare environment. For this purpose, a hypothetical business case in the oncology market has been developed considering four feasible development scenarios.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The article outlines the effects of development time and time to peak sales as key economic value drivers influencing profitability of SM interventions under specific conditions. If regulatory and reimbursement challenges can be solved, decreasing development time and enhancing early market penetration would most directly improve the economic attractiveness of SM interventions. Appropriate tailoring of highly differentiated patient subgroups is the prerequisite to leverage potential efficiency gains in the R&D process. Also, offering a better targeted and hence ultimately more cost-effective therapy at reimbursable prices will facilitate time to market access and allow increasing market share gains within the targeted populations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2016.09.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27664792/,economics

"Rationing, the equitable allocation of medical resources, is both an economic and moral challenge--economic, because the various components of healthcare must be budgeted; moral, because the prioritisation of these resources is a value-laden decision. The moral debate about rationing pits individual choice against communal interests. The advocacy of equitable distribution of healthcare resources originates in arguments for distributive justice and a revised version of individual autonomy. If autonomy is defined strictly in terms of atomistic individuality, then the social obligations and duties of persons are subordinated to their individual rights. Alternatively, when people are defined by their relationships, ""relational autonomy"" balances responsibilities against the claims of individual rights to maximise distributive justice. The concept of relational autonomy provides medicine with a philosophical basis for communal rationing of healthcare resources.",https://doi.org/10.5694/j.1326-5377.2003.tb05290.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12720514/,economics

The effect also holds if health inequality is instrumented to circumvent a potential problem of reverse causality.

"This paper describes a method for reducing the economic risks associated with predictable natural hazards by enhancing the resilience of national infrastructure systems. The three-step generalised framework is described along with examples. Step one establishes economic baseline growth without the disaster impact. Step two characterises economic growth constrained by a disaster. Step three assesses the economy's resilience to the disaster event when it is buffered by alternative resiliency investments. The successful outcome of step three is a disaster-resistant core of infrastructure systems and social capacity more able to maintain the national economy and development post disaster. In addition, the paper considers ways to achieve this goal in data-limited environments. The method provides a methodology to address this challenge via the integration of physical and social data of different spatial scales into macroeconomic models. This supports the disaster risk reduction objectives of governments, donor agencies, and the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7717.2011.01256.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21995603/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To determine and describe trends in economic variables related to the care of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and significant changes in these trends coincident with major developments in medical care cost control.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Data from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (NSCISC) database were used to review the economic trends in SCI management from 1973 to 1998 and their relation to managed care and other health care cost-containment measures. A panel of SCI health care specialists was interviewed to determine the appropriate data variables to be reviewed. The Shepherd Center Care Health Management Program, Atlanta, GA, is presented as an example of a fiscally successful managed care program for patients with SCI.
    


          Data extraction:
        
      
      Data from the NSCISC database for the years studied were extracted and converted to a form suitable for analysis by means of the statistical software SAS.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Statistical techniques included multiple regression analysis, logistic regression analysis, and model selection methods.

"Background:
        
      
      The choice of therapy for a displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture has long been a source of uncertainty in orthopaedic surgery, both in terms of the impact of the therapy on clinical outcomes and on health-care and non-health-care costs. We performed an economic evaluation, based on the results of a randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the economic implications of operative compared with nonoperative management of this fracture.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An economic evaluation was performed, with use of a four-year time horizon, to determine the effect on costs and health benefits of operative compared with nonoperative management for a group of patients with displaced intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus. The complication rate, arthrodesis rate, survival data, and health-outcome data were estimated prospectively from a recent randomized clinical trial. Direct health-care costs and indirect costs (the cost of time lost from work) were estimated retrospectively from the center treating the majority of the patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Operative management resulted in a lower rate of subtalar arthrodesis and a shorter time off from work compared with nonoperative treatment. When indirect costs, such as the time lost from work, were included in the analysis, operative management was less costly (an average savings of Can$19,000 per patient) and more effective, thus making it the preferred strategy. The result was most sensitive to the estimates of the costs of time lost from work. When these costs were excluded, operative treatment remained more effective, but with an increased average cost of Can$2800 per patient.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Calcaneal fractures have been recognized as having relatively poor clinical outcomes and a major socioeconomic impact with regard to time lost from work and recreation. Our analysis suggests that operative management of displaced intra-articular fractures is economically attractive. However, further exploration of the impact and valuation of time lost from work and patient outcomes is required.",https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.e.00166,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16322625/,economics
"This paper employs a general equilibrium framework to analyze the effects on economic growth of global expansions in casino gaming, which exports gambling services largely to non-residents. Both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy. However, an over-expansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income. If this situation persists, it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur. As a highly profitable sector, casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in non-gaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created. The gaming-dominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path, and will become less susceptible to business cycles. Indeed, economic experiences in the world's major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification. We believe that after the current global crisis fades away, economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10899-009-9165-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20012471/,economics
"This paper considers how pending proposals to authorize new forms of group purchasing arrangements for health insurance would fit and function within the existing, highly complex market and regulatory landscape and whether these proposals are likely to meet their stated objectives and avoid unintended consequences. Cost savings are more likely to result from increased risk segmentation than through true market efficiencies. Thus, these proposals could erode previous market reforms whose goal is increased risk pooling. On the other hand, these proposals contain important enhancements, clarifications, and simplification of state and federal regulatory oversight of group purchasing vehicles. Also, they address some of the problems that have hampered the performance of purchasing cooperatives. On balance, although these proposals should receive cautious and careful consideration, they are not likely to produce a significant overall reduction in premiums or increase in coverage.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.20.1.142,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11194835/,economics

"Both academic and economic goals must be served by the academic health center. In response to ongoing stresses on medicine, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Hospital rapidly developed and implemented an expanded system of medical care. Vertical integration included provision of both acute and chronic care facilities and both primary and specialty care, as well as insurance products, in particular a health maintenance organization. Horizontal integration was accomplished by acquisition of or affiliation with other hospitals. The realignment of medical resources and patients shifted the locus of medical education somewhat, from the traditional hospital setting to the ambulatory care setting (in which many students and residents will eventually practice anyway). In addition, many physicians in the new settings are not traditional Johns Hopkins faculty members. Results of educational efforts in these altered circumstances so far have been mixed, partly because the capacity of the individual center to train students and residents is necessarily limited, and the fragmentation of the system makes inevitable problems of quality control and management. These issues are being worked out. The drain on faculty resources for research imposed by the need to expand clinical practice has been offset by a system of awards for research to faculty members. Efforts are being made to sustain the excellence of the traditional Johns Hopkins faculty's reputation while assuring doctors newly affiliated with the Hopkins system that they are no less important to the system. Opportunities to learn and to teach more economical medicine while retaining quality are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-198901000-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2914052/,economics
"Background & aims:
        
      
      Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is indicated in patients with chronic intestinal failure. The aim of the current study was to review existing scientific literature of full or partial economic evaluations associated to HPN.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A bibliographic database search was undertaken in PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase and Scopus, complemented by a reference list search. We combined search terms regarding HPN and costs/health economics. The inclusion criteria included: a) population: all population and age groups; b) intervention: partial or full HPN; c) comparator: no parenteral nutrition, continued or intermittent hospital based PN, other nutritional interventions or no comparator; d) outcomes: cost outcomes and economic evaluations associated to HPN. A different quality assessment tool was used for each of the different type of economic approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-three papers were included in the final review. 21 were partial economic evaluations (16 cost-of-illness studies and 5 cost analyses), and 2 were full economic evaluations, both cost-utility analysis. Most studies investigated costs from a healthcare perspective (n = 18), therefore they included only direct costs. Three studies included personal costs for HPN patient. None of the studies included productivity costs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most scientific literature regarding the economic costs of HPN comes from partial economic evaluations, such as cost-of-illness studies and cost analysis. According to them, HPN is an expensive treatment, although cost saving when compared to hospital based parenteral nutrition (PN). Full economic evaluations proved HPN as being cost-effective than hospital based PN, however more research is needed to confirm this in all settings.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.06.010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32631611/,economics
"The efficiency-frontier approach (EFA) to health economic evaluation aims to benchmark the relative efficiency of new drugs with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of non-dominated comparators. By explicitly considering any differences in health outcomes and costs, it enhances the internal reference pricing (IRP) policy that was officially endorsed by Germany as the first country worldwide in 1989. However, the EFA has been repeatedly criticized since its official endorsement in 2009. Areas covered: This perspective aims to stimulate the debate by discussing whether the main objections to the EFA are technically valid, irrespective of national contextual factors in Germany with reservations towards using cost-per-quality-adjusted life year (QALY) thresholds. Moreover, we comparatively assessed whether the objections are truly unique to the EFA or apply equally to IRP and cost-effectiveness thresholds. Expert commentary: The plethora of objections to the EFA (n = 20) has obscured that many objections are neither technically valid nor unique to the EFA. Compared with cost-effectiveness thresholds, only two objections apply uniquely to the EFA and concern intended key properties: (1) no external thresholds are needed and (2) the EFA is sensitive to price changes of comparators.

"Until recently the costs of patients in German hospitals have mainly been calculated according to the length of hospital stay. However, in December 1999, a dramatic change was announced in the social laws in the ""Gesundheitsreform 2000."" Beginning in 2003 a prospective payment system based on the classification of the ""Australian Refined DRGs (AR-DRG)"" will be introduced. DRGs are already used in quite a lot of industrialized countries and basically are ""per case"" payment systems that group patients with homogeneous average costs based on the diagnoses and procedures performed in the hospital. When preparing for this new system, the clinician has a lot of additional tasks. Besides correctly documenting all clinical findings with the ICD-10 Diagnoses and the German OPS301 procedure codes, a knowledge of the economical impact of the clinical decision is absolutely crucial. The most important task is the optimizing of all clinical treatment processes (e.g. by the introduction of clinical pathways), because only hospitals that can do highly efficient treatment will be able to survive in the upcoming competitive situation. In the Krankenhaus München--Schwabing DRGs have been used as a benchmarking tool since 1997. Based on valuable experience, many direct measures to optimize efficiency have been taken. Especially in patients with multiple trauma, it became evident that the use of efficient and standardized treatment can bring economic gain without loss of quality.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s001130050745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11413951/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To examine the increasing use of health economic studies and practical implications of evaluating their quality utilizing the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We first reviewed secondary references to examine ways in which health economic analyses are used in different health care settings, the manner in which these data are appraised and evaluated, and their relevance and value in decision making. The QHES, a new instrument designed to support fast, accurate initial assessments of study quality, was then introduced and validated. A case study was performed using the QHES to score the quality of 30 cost-effectiveness studies in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) published since 1985. Areas where additional research could guide efforts to identify and enhance the use of higher-quality cost-effectiveness studies were suggested.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results from the published validation study of the QHES demonstrated the validity of this new instrument. The resulting QHES scores in the case study of GERD papers ranged from 43 to 91 with a mean of 63.6 (SD=14.7). Approximately 27% of the studies rated had scores less than 50, and 27% had scores above or equal to 75. All 30 studies made conclusions and recommendations and justified them based on their study results. Most studies used appropriate cost and health outcome measures. Very few studies stated the perspective of their analysis and reasons for its selection. The majority of the studies did not perform incremental analysis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An examination of the QHES validation study and the case study in GERD suggests that there is a rationale and potential utility to use a quality scoring system for cost-effectiveness studies. The QHES may play an important role in discriminating higher-quality cost-effectiveness information to enhance decision making. The QHES can also serve as a guideline for conducting and reporting future cost-effectiveness studies, as an aid in the editorial process, and for stratification in systematic reviews. Complex decisions regarding resource allocation rarely rely solely on economic considerations but do increasingly use health economic analyses. To the extent that such analyses are used, the QHES may help ensure that higher-quality analyses receive more analytic attention and greater weight in the decision-making process.",https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.1.53,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14613362/,economics
"To demonstrate the relevance of activity-based cost management (ABCM) for the occupational and environmental health community, the investigators used data generated by an ABCM model of a respiratory protection program (RPP) to develop options for solving a business problem.

The manager's dilemma is to maintain the integrity of the RPP while absorbing a significant budget cut. Various cost savings options are developed, and the assumptions under which these options operate are presented. It is emphasized that the RPP manager's primary responsibility is to assure worker health and safety by first understanding the technical issues, merits, and implications of any cost-cutting option that may be considered. It is argued that only then should the manager consider the financial merits of the possible solutions to this business problem.

"Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to determine the economic viability of stapes surgery in Germany. We compared the cost of the operation to the retail value and average cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Retrospective study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Tertiary referral centre.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      One hundred and sixty-four consecutive cases of primary stapedotomy performed on patients with otosclerosis at our institution served as the representative group for the calculation. The post-operative air-bone gap average at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz was less than 10 dB for 62 per cent of the patients, and less than 20 dB for 92 per cent of the patients. There was a post-operative sensorineural hearing loss in 1.2 per cent of the patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysis showed that, even for an elderly patient aged 65 years with a life expectancy of 15 years, the cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids was greater than that of a stapedotomy procedure. Based on our group of patients, the stapedotomy procedure proved to be euro 800,000 K cheaper than treatment with an averagely priced hearing aid. The economic benefit was still present when taking into account possible revision surgery in 5-10 per cent of cases, and also when, in addition to the surgery, a post-operative hearing aid was required, in for example 20 per cent of cases.

The current dominant philosophy in government is to alter the health care field from a heavily regulated one to one characterized by competition. By reducing regulatory constraints and encouraging competition, government believes more efficient health care delivery will result. Health care payment systems now include the diagnosis related group method, all-payor rates and contracting for services with major insurance companies on discount, per diem, capitation and per case rates. Reduced use of resources assumes changes in the practice of medicine from an elaborate system of medical care to a more basic one. The implications are many and the possible effects severe. There will be reduced levels of support for medical education, particularly for fellows and for those beyond the third year of residency training. A decreased hospital census and the thrust to perform more services on an outpatient basis question the basic structure of medical education focused on the inpatient. Teaching hospitals will have to develop networking arrangements, a forced cooperativeness that threatens the autonomy of training and research programs. The recent entry of for-profit health care corporations into research may compromise the integrity of the university hospital as a center for clinical care, education and research.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0002-9149(85)80005-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3927695/,economics
"We used an individual regression and panel data regression method to analyze the samples of 60 countries from 2000 to 2016 to study the impact of the economic recession on residents' out-of-pocket payment willingness for health care. Although we found an increase in the willingness during the economic recession in most countries, we couldn't find significant evidence of a positive relationship between the economic recession and such willingness. We discovered that the relationship differentiates in different countries, which mainly depends on the differences in the medical systems and degree of economic development. By controlling individual differences in countries, we found that the economic recession inhibited the out-of-pocket payment willingness for health care. Especially after the impact of the financial crisis in 2008, the cumulative effect of the economic recession and the aftershock of financial crisis was discovered, which significantly inhibited residents' willingness. In addition, we verified that the economic recession inhibited the out-of-pocket payment willingness by reducing employee compensation in specific types of countries.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17030713,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31979072/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      China's government has decided to increase government funding by 1-1.5% of the Gross Domestic Products in the health care sector. However, it is still a question how to turn the new funding into efficient health care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To help to answer this question we analyze three prototype models of organizing the health care system that may be relevant for China, namely the ""Government provision model"", the ""regulated market with non-competing third-party purchasers"", and the ""regulated market with competing third-party purchasers"". The pre- and post-reform English health care system and the present Dutch health care system are used as examples of the three models. During the last 20 years these countries had, just as China, major health care reforms from a national centrally planned system to a market-based system. Based on the experiences in these countries we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these three prototype models and discuss their relevance for China.
    


          Results and conclusions:

"Whether we like it or not, medicine is big business. The argument is sometimes made that standard management strategies from the business world do not apply to medicine because the economics and practice of medicine are unique--driven by science and rapid rates of change. But an exploding knowledge base, light-speed technological development, and ever-changing reimbursement schemes are not exclusive to medicine and health care. Some fundamental principles of finance, business management, and strategic development have evolved to deal with problems of rapid change. These principles do apply to modern medicine.

"Background:
        
      
      Economic evaluations are quantitative methods comparing alternative interventions using cost data and expected outcomes. They are used to recommend/dissuade adoption of new surgical interventions and compare different clinical pathways, settings (inpatient/outpatient), or time horizons to determine which procedure may be more cost-effective. The objective of this systematic review was to describe all published English economic evaluations related to a plastic surgery domain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive English literature review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Health Economic Evaluations Database, Ovid Health Star, and Business Source Complete databases was conducted (January 1, 1986, to June 15, 2012). Articles were assessed by two independent reviewers using predefined data fields and selected using specific inclusion criteria. Extracted information included country of origin, journal, and date of publication. Domain of plastic surgery and type of economic evaluation were ascertained.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-five articles were included in the final analysis, with cost analysis being the most common economic evaluation (82 percent). Full economic evaluations represented 18 percent. General cutaneous disorders/burns (24 percent), breast surgery (20 percent), and ""multiple"" (15 percent) were the top domains studied. Authors were predominantly based in the United States (56 percent) and published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (22 percent), with a significant proportion (40 percent) published in the last 5 years.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Partial economic assessments (cost analyses) with limited benefit represent the majority of economic evaluations in plastic surgery. This suggests an urgent need to alert plastic surgeons to the advantages of full economic evaluations (cost-effectiveness and cost utility analyses) and the need to perform such rigorous analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e318290f8f8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23508049/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      On October 1, 2013, the reporting of diagnoses and procedures in the U.S. will transition from the clinical modification of the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) to the tenth revision (ICD-10). We estimate the impact of conversion to ICD-10 on Medicare MS-DRG payments to hospitals using 2009 Medicare data.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the ICD-9-CM MS-DRG v27 (FY 2010), the converted ICD-10 MS-DRG v27, and the ICD-10 to ICD-9-CM Reimbursement Map for fiscal year 2010, we estimate the impact on aggregate payments to hospitals and the distribution of payments across hospitals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Although the transition from the ICD-9-CM to the ICD-10 version of MS-DRGs resulted in 1.68 percent of the patients being assigned to a different MS-DRG, payment increases and decreases due to the changes in MS-DRG assignment essentially netted out, resulting in a minimal impact on aggregate payments to hospitals (+0.05 percent) and on the distribution of payments across hospital types (-0.01 to +0.18 percent). Mapping ICD-10 data back to ICD-9-CM, and using the ICD-9-CM MS-DRGs, resulted in 3.66 percent of patients being assigned to a different MS-DRG, a modest decrease in aggregate payments to hospitals (-0.34 percent), and modest changes in the distribution of payments across hospital types (-0.14 to -0.46 percent).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      As demonstrated by MS-DRGs, a direct conversion of an application to ICD-10 can produce consistent results with the ICD-9-CM version of the application. However, the use of mappings between ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM will produce less consistent results, especially if the mapping is not tailored to the specific application.",https://doi.org/10.5600/mmrr.001.02.a02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22340773/,economics
"Financialization and neoliberal policy created the Celtic Tiger. This economic 'miracle' furthered creditors' and property developers' speculative interests, leading to an unstable financial pyramid that eventually imploded in 2008 with catastrophic consequences for Irish society. Using the sociological imagination as social critique, this paper offers a lens on fictitious capital and Ponzi finance in the context of Ireland's boom and bust. Critique is advanced using the Madoffization of society thesis, a sociological heuristic that draws formal comparisons between Bernie Madoff's US$65 billion Ponzi scheme, which collapsed in 2008, and financialized capitalism. The Madoff case exhibits five main elements or forms which, it has been argued, underlie the varying content of life on a much broader scale: accumulation by debt expansion, mass deception, efforts to maintain secrecy and silence, obfuscation, and scapegoating. In conclusion, a crucial difference between the Madoff case and the Madoffization of Irish society is underscored.

"Expenditure on drugs is increasing rapidly in many countries, and this has led to increased interest in measures to contain drug expenditure. One measure that has been discussed is to increase user charges for prescription drug. In this article, we consider whether or not raising user charges decreases the consumption of drugs. We also discuss how to judge if increased user charges for drugs are desirable from an economic viewpoint. We conclude that the decision to increase user charges for prescription drugs should not be viewed as an issue of cost containment, but as a matter of balancing the societal costs against the societal benefits of increased user charges.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199609060-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10160475/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Only a small share of new drugs is truly innovative; 85% to 90% of all new health technologies have little or no advantage over existing therapeutic alternatives. Health economic evaluations can be used to induce acceptable prices for new technologies through threshold pricing.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This work discusses a cost-effectiveness threshold (λ) to be applied to the price regulation of substitute technologies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Considering that substitute technologies add only small marginal benefits in terms of innovation or ethical considerations to the system, it does not make sense to allow a loss of efficiency to list them. It has been postulated that the threshold calculated from opportunity costs (κ) represents its maximum possible value and that there must be a threshold (β) that maximizes consumer surplus. For a substitute technology to be listed, the cost of treatment associated with it must be lower than the cost of treatment of the incumbent technology added to the difference in effectiveness priced at the threshold.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There is no reason for us to believe that the oligopolistic pharmaceutical market is currently charging prices at the cost of production. That way, the cost-effectiveness ratio of the incumbent technology, when lower than κ, is shown through a deductive process to be a plausible estimate for λ that fulfills the objective of maximizing consumer benefit, granting producers a part of the combined surplus to stimulate research and development; that is, it would be between β and κ.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In conclusion, the price of substitute technologies should be limited by the cost-effectiveness ratio of the incumbent technology.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2019.08.474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31561148/,economics

"In this article we describe how reimbursement cost-effectiveness thresholds, per unit of health benefit, whether set explicitly or observed implicitly via historical reimbursement decisions, serve as a signal to firms about the commercial viability of their R&D projects (including candidate products for in-licensing). Traditional finance methods for R&D project valuations, such as net present value analyses (NPV), incorporate information from these payer reimbursement signals to help determine which R&D projects should be continued and which should be terminated (in the case of the latter because they yield an NPV < 0). Because the influence these signals have for firm R&D investment decisions is so significant, we argue that it is important for reimbursement thresholds to reflect the economic value of the unit of health benefit being considered for reimbursement. Thresholds set too low (below the economic value of the health benefit) will result in R&D investment levels that are too low relative to the economic value of R&D (on the margin). Similarly, thresholds set too high (above the economic value of the health benefit) will result in inefficiently high levels of R&D spending. The US in particular, which represents approximately half of the global pharmaceutical market (based on sales), and which seems poised to begin undertaking cost effectiveness in a systematic way, needs to exert caution in setting policies that explicitly or implicitly establish cost-effectiveness reimbursement thresholds for healthcare products and technologies, such as pharmaceuticals.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11313750-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19803536/,economics

"The purpose of this paper is to review the rising influence of commercialism in American medicine and to examine some of the consequences of this trend. Increased competition subverts physician collegiality, draws hospitals into for-profit ownership and behavior, and leads clinical investigators into secrecy and possibly into bias and abuse. Medicine faces a deprofessionalization evidence in loss of control over the clinical setting and over self-regulation. Health care becomes a commodity relying on cultivation of desires instead of satisfaction of needs, even as many basic needs go unmet. Patients become consumers empowered with lawsuits and the connection of medicine to the relief of suffering is attenuated. Medical encounters are increasingly impersonal, dominated by specialization, technology, and bureaucracy. Patients are losing their physician-advocates to new conflicts of interests, physicians are losing their impulse to charity, and trust in the doctor-patient relationship and in medicine generally is eroding.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00489818,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2291222/,economics
"Prices are the major driver of why the United States spends so much more on health care than other countries do. The pricing power that hospitals have garnered recently has resulted from consolidated delivery systems and concentrated markets, leading to enhanced negotiating leverage. But consolidation may be the wrong frame for viewing the problem of high and highly variable prices; many ""must-have"" hospitals achieve their pricing power from sources other than consolidation, for example, reputation. Further, the frame of consolidation leads to unrealistic expectations for what antitrust's role in addressing pricing power should be, especially because in the wake of two periods of merger ""manias"" and ""frenzies"" many markets already lack effective competition. It is particularly challenging for antitrust to address extant monopolies lawfully attained. New payment and delivery models being pioneered in Medicare, especially those built around accountable care organizations (ACOs), offer an opportunity to reduce pricing power, but only if they are implemented with a clear eye on the impact on prices in commercial insurance markets. This article proposes approaches that public and private payers should consider to complement the role of antitrust to assure that ACOs will actually help control costs in commercial markets as well as in Medicare and Medicaid.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-3150026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26124302/,economics

Hence, This paper presents the techno-economic assessment for a comprehensive process for the recovery of metals and critical materials from e-waste, which is based in an electrochemical recovery (ER) technology. Economic comparison is performed with the treatment of e-waste via smelting, which is currently the primary route for recycling metals from electronics. Results indicate that the electrochemical recovery process is a competitive alternative for the recovery of value from electronic waste when compared with the traditional black Cu smelting process.

"Aim:
        
      
      To characterize the patterns of competition for a sample of drugs in the Portuguese pharmaceutical market before (January 2002-March 2003) and after (April 2003-June 2003) the introduction of the reference pricing system (RPS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a descriptive, retrospective, longitudinal analysis, with monthly observations from January 2002 until June 2003 of 15 homogeneous groups. The groups represented the upper limit of public pharmaceutical expenditure in the RPS segment in 2003 (n=270). Measures of competition were: 1) number of presentations; 2) prescriptions' concentration in the generic and originator (brand) segments, using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI); and 3) dominant positions of market leader in the homogeneous group. A correlation analysis between the number of presentations, the HHI, and the dominant position of the market leader was performed using Pearson coefficient of correlation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The structure of the market changed with the introduction of RPS. We found an increasing number of generic presentations (from 4+/-3 to 7+/-4; mean+/-standard deviation) and a decrease in the HHI for the generics market segment (from 0.7+/-0.2 to 0.6+/-0.3). There was a negative correlation between those variables that increased after the introduction of RPS (from -0.6 to -0.8). The HHI for brands and the dominant positions remained unchanged.

"An on-line Medicaid billing system for physicians' services was implemented and tested during a two and one-half year period in 100 offices throughout the State of +0.50,Alabama. Participating physicians represented 17% of all physicians in the state. The monthly volume of Medicaid claims entered through the system represented more than 50% of the statewide load processed by the Medicaid carrier. Users entered claims data on standard Touch Tone telephones equipped with Carddialers, and received instructions and data confirmation from the central computer facility via voice answer-back. Input time for the average claim billing for two separate services was less than one and one-half minutes and resulted in a reduction of clerical labor required for manual input by at least 50%. After a fee-for-service was inaugurated, the system workload remained at 86% of its load level before fee for service. Those physicians willing to pay for the billing service were high-volume users who had come to depend on the system and who appreciated the economics that the system had achieved for them in their office billing practices. An average claim consisting of two items of service could be billed at a cost of $0.50,, exclusive of user terminal rental ($6 per month per office) and the cost of data entry personnel (between $0.05 and $0.10 + 0.05 and $.10 per claim). Various algorithms have been offered for use in estimating an annual budget for an on-line billing system given alternative system configurations, methods of financing, annual volume of units of service, and the geographical nature of the population to be served. The tasks of preparing, processing, and storing insurance claims information have placed a costly and time-consuming burden on both providers of medical services and fiscal intermediaries. The unfortunate result is that the cost of submitting an insurance claim for professional medical services is a disproportionate fraction of the amount paid for providing the service. For general practitioners, who provide the largest number of individual services, this share may be more than one-fourth of the payment for most common services. Similarly, for the Medicaid or Medicare intermediary or for the insurance carrier, the cost of preparing and recording data from source documents is a large part of total processing costs. The objective of the On-Line Medicaid Billing System project was to demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the costs of submitting claims from the physician's office as well as to reduce the costs of data preparation in the carrier's system.

"Background:
        
      
      In 2003, China established a New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) for rural residents to alleviate the burden of medical expenses among rural residents. However, its reimbursement for high medical costs was insufficient. Therefore, China gradually established the Serious Illness Insurance System (SIMIS) based on NRCMS. After receiving payment through NRCMS, patients in rural areas who met the requirements of SIMIS policy would receive a second payment for their high medical expenses. This study aimed to analyze the effect of the implementation of SIMIS on alleviating the economic burden of rural residents in Jinzhai County.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study used the inpatient reimbursement data of NRCMS in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, from 2013 to 2016. We adopted descriptive and regression discontinuity (RD) methods to analyze the payment effect of SIMIS. The RD analysis targeted patients (n = 7353) whose annual serious illness expenses were between CNY 10,000 (1414 USD) and CNY 30,000 (4242 USD), whereas the descriptive analysis was used for data of the patients compensated by SIMIS (n = 2720).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results of RD showed that the actual medical insurance payment proportion increased by about 2.5% (lwald = 0.025, P < 0.01), inside medical insurance self-payment proportion increased by about 2% (lwald = 0.020, P < 0.10), and outside medical insurance self-payment proportion decreased by about 1.6% (lwald = - 0.016, P < 0.05). The descriptive results showed that patients with serious illnesses mostly chose to go to a hospital outside the county. The annual average number of hospitalizations was 3.64. The reimbursement mainly came from the NRCMS. The payment amount of SIMIS was relatively small, and the out-of-pocket medical expenses were still high.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The medical technology level of Jinzhai County could not meet the needs of patients with seriously illnesses, the number of beneficiaries of SIMIS was small, and the ability to relieve the burden of medical expenses of the rural residents was insufficient. The high out-of-pocket expenses increased the possibility that only people with good economic conditions could benefit from the reimbursement of SIMIS, resulting in inequity.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05675-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32859192/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To describe the three different ways in which 'willingness to pay' (WTP) has been used to elicit patients' values of alternative interventions.
    


          Design:
        
      
      For each of the three approaches a survey of patients or the public was undertaken. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: studied For two surveys, the setting was Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, where pregnant women were asked about their WTP for different methods of prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis. In the third survey, parents of primary and secondary schoolchildren were asked about their WTP for different ways of providing child health services.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Ability of WTP to discriminate between options (i.e. to say whether one option is 'better' than another) and the consistency of WTP with stated preferences.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Experience with some methods shows that, despite the apparent logic of the technique, it is difficult to elicit consistent responses whereby WTP values derived match the rankings of interventions compared. The most promising technique, the 'marginal approach', happens to conform more with economic theory than other approaches. Potential limitations of WTP, such as its association with ability to pay, are discussed, as are approaches to dealing with such problems. Finally, if patients prefer an intervention that is more costly than the status quo, logic dictates that those extra resources will have to be obtained from another health-care programme. In such contexts, to aid decision-making, values derived from members of the community for different programmes may be more relevant than values derived from patients. Initial studies in the use of WTP in this broader context of eliciting community values are also outlined.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      WTP has potential, but its application, and interpretation, are not straightforward. More testing of the 'marginal approach' is required and greater use of qualitative research, to assess the validity of the approach, should be made in this area.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1369-6513.2001.00126.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11493324/,economics

          Conclusion:
        
      
      Despite methodological diversity across the studies, there is a consensus that both underweight and overweight impose a substantial financial burden on healthcare systems in the Asia-Pacific region.",https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.12679,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26892222/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      This analysis evaluates the impact of bundling drug costs into a hypothetic bundled payment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An economic model was created for patient vignettes from: advanced-stage III colon cancer and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. First quarter 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates were used to calculate the average fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement for these vignettes. The probabilistic risk faced by practices was captured by the type of patients seen in practices and randomly assigned in a Monte Carlo simulation on the basis of the given distribution of patient types within each cancer. Simulations were replicated 1,000 times. The impact of bundled payments that include drug costs for various practice sizes and cancer types was quantified as the probability of incurring a loss at four magnitudes: any loss, > 10%, > 20%, or > 30%. A loss was defined as receiving revenue from the bundle that was less than what the practice would have received under FFS; the probability of loss was calculated on the basis of the number of times a practice reported a loss among the 1,000 simulations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Practices that treat a substantial proportion of patients with complex disease compared with the average patient in the bundle would have revenue well below that expected from FFS. Practices that treat a disproportionate share of patients with less complex disease, as compared with the average patient in the bundle, would have revenue well above the revenue under FFS. Overall, bundled payments put practices at greater risk than FFS because their patient case mix could greatly skew financial performance.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Including drug costs in a bundle is subject to the uncontrollable probabilistic risk of patient case mixes.",https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.17.00036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29648923/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      To determine whether all the existing and planned proton beam therapy (PBT) centers in the United States can survive on a local patient mix that is dictated by insurers, not by number of patients.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      We determined current and projected cancer rates for 10 major US metropolitan areas. Using published utilization rates, we calculated patient percentages who are candidates for PBT. Then, on the basis of current published insurer coverage policies, we applied our experience of what would be covered to determine the net number of patients for whom reimbursement is expected. Having determined the net number of covered patients, we applied our average beam delivery times to determine the total number of minutes needed to treat that patient over the course of their treatment. We then calculated our expected annual patient capacity per treatment room to determine the appropriate number of treatment rooms for the area.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The population of patients who will be both PBT candidates and will have treatments reimbursed by insurance is significantly smaller than the population who should receive PBT. Coverage decisions made by insurers reduce the number of PBT rooms that are economically viable.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The expansion of PBT centers in the US is not sustainable under the current reimbursement model. Viability of new centers will be limited to those operating in larger regional metropolitan areas, and few metropolitan areas in the US can support multiple centers. In general, 1-room centers require captive (non-PBT-served) populations of approximately 1,000,000 lives to be economically viable, and a large center will require a population of >4,000,000 lives. In areas with smaller populations or where or a PBT center already exists, new centers require subsidy.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.02.014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24685152/,economics
"The United States health-care expenditure is rising precipitously. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, in 2025, at our current rate of increased spending, 25% of the gross domestic product will be allocated to health care. Our per-capita spending on health care also far exceeds that of any other industrialized country. Health-care costs must be addressed if our country is to remain competitive in the global marketplace and to maintain its financial solvency. If unchecked, the uncontrolled rise in health-care expenditures will not only affect our capacity to provide our patients with high-quality care but also threaten the ability of our nation to compete economically on the global stage. This is not hyperbole but fiscal reality.As physicians, we are becoming increasingly familiar with the economics impacting health-care policy. Thus, we are in a unique position to control the cost of health care. This includes an increased reliance on creating and adhering to evidence-based guidelines. We can do this and still continue to respect the primacy of patient welfare and the right of patients to act in their own self-interest. However, as evidenced by the use of high-volume centers of excellence, each strategy adapted to control costs must be vetted and must be monitored for its unintended ethical consequences.The solution to this complex problem must involve the input of all of the health-care stakeholders, including the patients, payers, and providers. Physicians ought to play a role in designing and executing a remedy. After all, we are the ones who best understand medicine and whose moral obligation is to the welfare of our patients.",https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.15.00889,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27440574/,economics
"The Australian government implemented a series of private health insurance (PHI) policy reforms between 1997 and 2000. As a result, the proportion of the population with PHI coverage increased by more than 35%. However, this study found significant evidence that the policy reform disproportionately favours high-income earners. In particular, the 30% premium subsidy represents a windfall gain for households which would have purchased PHI even without the rebate. The amount of such gain is estimated to be around $900 million per year, a large proportion of which went to higher income households.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-008-0111-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18548303/,economics
"In an era of health care reform, costs, cost-effectiveness and charges for health care are taking on a larger role in the decision to adopt a new therapy. Hospitals, health maintenance organizations, third-party payers, doctors and patients all have an interest in the economic factors of health care; however, not all new therapies or medications have been analyzed. Bone marrow transplantation is one of the most expensive cancer treatments, costing an average of +193,000 per patient; therefore, many economic studies have focused on the costs of the therapy. However, it is important to note that these findings are not necessarily applicable to other diseases. Cost data are not static and even small changes in protocol can make a large difference in costs. Also, cost data from outside the United States is not always applicable to the United States system due to differences such as socialized medicine, workers' wages and pharmaceutical costs. Many economic analyses focus on the hospitals' charges and extrapolate cost-effectiveness from these figures, yet the amount hospitals charge for services and products is not always relative to the costs. Therefore, third-party payer costs are also important in analyzing the cost-effectiveness of a procedure. This article will review five signature papers which illustrate important issues to consider when trying to determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of bone marrow transplants.",https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.140312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8724697/,economics
"The burgeoning population of patients requiring renal replacement therapy contributes a disproportionate strain on National Health Service resources.

An understanding of dialysis economics is essential for both healthcare providers and clinical leaders to establish clinically efficient and cost-effective treatment modalities that maximize service provision.

"Since the 1960s, expenditure on health care in developed countries has risen faster than the general rate of inflation, thus making economic assessment of interventions an integral part of decision making in health services. This paper is the first in a series whose goal is to provide some basic principles of health economics that will allow practising physicians to understand better the economic relations between their practice of medicine, the health-care sector, and the national economy. Some of the most important principles described in this paper include opportunity costs, identifying the appropriate perspective, correctly categorising costs, and discounting costs and non-monetary benefits (eg, lives saved) over time. Economic analyses of medical interventions must also take into consideration the difference between efficacy and effectiveness. Efficacy is the maximum possible benefit, often achieved with carefully controlled trials, and effectiveness is the actual decrease in disease achieved when the intervention is applied over a large, non-homogeneous population. This introduction ends with three methods of assessing the costs and benefits of an intervention-namely, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(01)06107-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11583768/,economics
"The article criticizes the present variability of economic appraisal methodologies and supports their standardization as a means of ensuring the comparability of the results of studies done by different researchers. Standards should be theoretically sound and feasible, and are probably best attained by consensus between the research community and users. Standardization is not without some dangers, e.g. the risk of excessive rigidity or the discouragement of further methodological research. These dangers can however be easily avoided and are likely to be overcome by the potential benefits: comparability and transferability of the results of the studies; increased credibility and, hence, broader use of economic appraisal as a regular tool for decision making. It will also ensure that if applied in regulatory or reimbursement decisions in the EC Member States, economic evaluation does not contribute to create market barriers to the free movement of products within the Single Market of health technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)90069-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8047926/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Fiscal constraints faced by Medicare are leading to policies designed to reduce expenditures. Evidence of the effect of reduced reimbursement on the mortality of Medicare patients discharged from all major hospital service lines is limited.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We modeled risk-adjusted 30-day mortality of patients discharged from 21 hospital service lines as a function of service line profitability, service line time trends, and hospital service line and year-fixed effects. We simulated the effect of alternative revenue-neutral reimbursement policies on mortality. Our sample included all Medicare discharges from PPS-eligible hospitals (1997, 2001, and 2005).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results reveal a statistically significant inverse relationship between changes in profitability and mortality. A $0.19 average reduction in profit per $1.00 of costs led to a 0.010-0.020 percentage-point increase in mortality rates (p < .001). Mortality in newly unprofitable service lines is significantly more sensitive to reduced payment generosity than in service lines that remain profitable. Policy simulations that target service line inequities in payment generosity result in lower mortality rates, roughly 700-13,000 fewer deaths nationally.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The policy simulations raise questions about the trade-offs implicit in universal reductions in reimbursement. The effect of reduced payment generosity on mortality could be mitigated by targeting highly profitable services only for lower reimbursement.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.12026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23346946/,economics

"The rising cost of treating hypertension has become an issue of concern in several countries, including the United States, parts of Europe, and more recently, New Zealand. In New Zealand between 1981 and 1987, the total inflation-adjusted expenditure on antihypertensive drugs increased by 61.7%, from $21.4 million to $34.6 million in constant 1981 dollars. The major part (56.3%) of this increase in overall expenditure was explained by the rise in real cost of drug treatment, while the number of patients on drug therapy remained virtually static over the same period. The average cost of a prescription for hypertension was estimated to have risen by 46.1% between 1981 and 1987, i.e. from $7.30 to $10.66 in constant 1981 dollars. Pardoxically the mean inflation-adjusted price of antihypertensive drugs fell by 10.8% over the same period. Changing patterns of prescription and the entry of new drugs into the market accounted for most of the rise in average cost per prescription over the study period. Unless the rising expenditure can be justified by demonstrable improvements in treatment outcome, continuation of these trends will have profound effects on the cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(89)90077-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10313250/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      An economic evaluation of the resources used for mechanically ventilated patients using various measures for the benefits of extending life.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Regression analysis is applied to New York State discharge data for patients under DRG 475 during 1992-96 to predict age-specific survival rates and payments per life saved.

"Damages awarded in a malpractice suit must be viewed not only as compensating the victim but also as deterring health-care providers from negligent behavior. Economic analysis of the malpractice system indicates that awards can send a signal to providers that informs them how much to invest in avoiding mishaps. The malpractice system is beset by difficulties, but not the ones commonly incriminated. The signal to the physician, as determined by the number of claims and size of awards (""expected damages""), appears to be insufficient for ideal deterrence. Moreover, the deterrence signal is attenuated because malpractice premiums are set for groups of physicians, not for individuals according to their record of previous malpractice incidents. Replacing the present tort system with a no-fault insurance scheme would not necessarily be cheaper, and might well abolish the deterrent signal or distort clinical decision making.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm197806082982304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/418337/,economics
"Macao's gaming industry has experienced dramatic growth for 8 years, yet with certain social costs due to compulsive gambling. The government has come under pressure for tax cuts even though its gaming receipts are falling relatively to the casino retained revenue. The request for tax relief is triggered by a recent decline in net profit despite fast growing gross gaming revenue under favorable market conditions. This is very likely caused by a substantial hike in casino operating costs due to increased competition and might also signal the presence of the principal-agent problem. Given the regressivity of gaming tax with respect to net profit, it is no surprise that casinos with lower profitability are more prone to seek tax cuts. The source of Macao gaming profit hinges on three distinct factors: rising demand from China, monopoly location for casinos, and market structure of oligopoly. These factors provide economic justifications for the current tax regime of Macao with a strong ability to pass tax burdens on to massive visitors. The government relies on casino tax revenue to deal with gambling related problems and promote local diversified development.

"Objectives:
        
      
      The aims of this paper are threefold: first to review briefly the theoretical literature on competition and its predicted effects on health care quality; secondly to describe the attempts to introduce competition into the UK National Health Service (NHS); and third to review the outcomes of this experiment and ask how far the research findings are consistent with the next phase of reform that the new Labour Government proposed in late 1997.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      A search was conducted using electronic data bases Unicorn, Medline and Health Planning and official monitoring statistics within the NHS. All references relating to district-based purchasing, general practitioner (GP) fundholding in its various forms and GP commissioning were reviewed.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      Preference was given to prospective before and after studies with and without control groups, retrospective studies with and without controls, and case studies which were reinforced by similar supporting case studies.

Without aiming at an exhaustive list he then looks at the different value conflicts which could be picked out, a characteristic of ethical research. He states first of all that economic appraisals in health care try to bring together very different value systems in using common criteria in decisions, but this cannot completely eliminate these systems and the conflicts which stem from them. In particular he underlines the phenomenon of occultation which could result from the use of mathematical formulae. After the contradictions between medicine and economics he then goes on to point out the contradictions between the levels of understanding reality, between fields of economic or social considerations.

"Governmental research grants are financially supported by taxpayers to meet financial requirements of research, particularly research that is unlikely to be supported by private funds. Researchers reward donors by producing knowledge. Publishing research results in an academic journal reflects achievement by researchers; however, receiving a grant award does not. The latter only provides the researcher with the capacity to perform his/her research. Applicants may receive more financial support than they actually need because there is no strict audit on the amount of money requested by each research proposal. There are fewer opportunities to apply for a governmental grant than there are for publishing an academic article, and the application process for governmental grants is not flexible. Some potentially innovative research may be impeded by the intense competition among scientific researchers applying for financial support. Researchers face stiffer competition at this stage than at the stage of publishing results.

"The paper investigates the relationship between the willingness to pay and the cost of illness approach with respect to the evaluation of economic burden due to adverse health effects. The basic intertemporal framework is provided by Grossman's pure investment model, while effects on individual morbidity are taken to be generated by marginal changes in the rate of health capital depreciation. More specifically, both the simple example of purely temporary changes and the more general case of persistent variations in health capital depreciation are discussed. The analysis generates two principal findings. First, for a class of identical individuals cost as measured by the cost of illness approach is demonstrated to provide a lower bound on the true welfare cost to the individual, i.e. cost as given by the willingness to pay approach. Moreover, the cost of illness is increasing in the size of the welfare loss. Second, if one takes into account the possible heterogeneity of individuals, a clear relationship between the cost values supplied by the two approaches no longer exists. As an example, the impact of variations in either financial wealth or health capital endowment is discussed. Thus, diversity in individual type turns out to blur the link between cost of illness and the true economic cost.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199609)5:5<447::aid-hec220>3.0.co;2-#,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8922972/,economics
"While the development of personalized or molecular medicine is a laudable goal, there remain multiple barriers to its implementation. For example, little is known about the functions of noncoding regions of DNA, as well as the interplay of drug response, environmental factors, and the patient's genetic profile. In addition, there is a constant influx of new information on genetic factors such as epigenetic variation that could further complicate the development of medications based on the genetic profile, as well as the cost of profiling. However, assuming that clinically relevant genetic factors will be discovered and that drugs can be developed based on the molecular changes induced by those genetic factors, I suggest that the costs involved may substantially exceed the savings brought about by abandoning our current ""one drug fits all"" approach.

It also reviews the importance of economic analysis in decision-making and in more detail the very useful tools also used in the field of nutrition economics, such as cost-of-disease studies, cost-effectiveness studies and budget impact. We analyze different works that have allowed us to advance in these fields in recent years. Finally, the difficulties related to the financing of nutrition in the centers as well as the regulation of enteral nutrition in the home are analyzed. The creation of value in clinical nutrition is a task for everyone (healthcare professionals, patients, managers and the pharmaceutical industry).",https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.2341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30525862/,economics
"Although therapeutic or elective abortions are among the most frequently performed medical procedures for women throughout the world, indigent American women are now denied coverage under the Medicaid program because of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for the termination of pregnancies except in narrowly defined cases. The vast majority of states, left free to choose as to the expenditure of their own funds for abortion coverage, have also denied this type of welfare assistance to economically eligible women. The discriminatory effect of the refusal to subsume abortions as part of the Medicaid mandate has been the subject of various legal actions. The constitutionality of that denial is at issue and now awaits Supreme Court determination.",https://doi.org/10.1086/643808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10297796/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The current societal costs of bipolar I disorder (BDI) have not been comprehensively characterized in the United States, as previous studies are based on data from two decades ago.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The costs of BDI were estimated for 2015 and comprised direct healthcare costs, non-healthcare costs, and indirect costs, calculated based on a BDI prevalence of 1%. The excess costs of BDI were estimated as the difference between the costs incurred by individuals with BDI and those incurred by individuals without BD or individuals from the general population. Direct healthcare costs were assessed using three large US claims databases for insured individuals and the literature for uninsured individuals. Direct non-healthcare and indirect costs were based on the literature and governmental publications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total costs of BDI were estimated at $202.1 billion in 2015, corresponding to an average of $81,559 per individual, while the excess costs of BDI were estimated at $119.8 billion, corresponding to an average of $48,333 per individual. The largest contributors to excess costs were caregiving (36%), direct healthcare costs (21%), and unemployment (20%). In sensitivity analyses, excess costs ranged from $101.2 to $124.3 billion.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Direct healthcare costs were calculated based on a BDI diagnosis, thus excluding undiagnosed patients. Direct non-healthcare and indirect costs were based on combined estimates from the literature.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Besides direct healthcare costs, BDI was associated with substantial direct non-healthcare and indirect costs. More effective treatments and practices are needed to optimize therapeutic strategies and contain direct and indirect costs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2017.09.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28961441/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Economic evaluations of clinical pharmacy interventions are reviewed.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      A variety of clinical pharmacy interventions have been assessed, but the body of evidence relating to any particular type of intervention is small. Cost-saving interventions comprise a small percentage of clinical pharmacy interventions, but they generated substantial savings. Clinical pharmacists provided added value by participating in multidisciplinary teams attending rounds. Clinical pharmacy interventions reduced preventable adverse drug events and prescribing errors, thereby yielding savings related to cost avoidance. Interventions relating to antibiotic therapy lowered costs of care without adversely affecting clinical outcomes. The results of cost-benefit analyses suggested that general clinical pharmacy interventions are associated with cost savings. Most economic evaluations of clinical pharmacy interventions suffered from a number of methodological limitations relating to the absence of a control group without clinical pharmacy interventions, limited scope of costs and outcomes, focus on direct health care costs only, exclusion of pharmacist employment cost, use of intermediate outcome measures, exclusion of health benefits, and absence of incremental cost analysis. Some avenues for designing future economic evaluations include the use of a control group, detailed descriptions of the interventions provided, evaluations conducted from a societal perspective, consideration of patients' health benefits when assessing economic effect of interventions and hospital costs, and the inclusion of sensitivity and incremental analyses.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Most pharmacoeconomic evaluations of clinical pharmacy interventions demonstrated limitations in their methodological quality and applicability to current practice. Future evaluations should use a comparative study design that includes the incremental cost-effectiveness or cost:benefit ratio of clinical pharmacy interventions from a societal perspective.",https://doi.org/10.2146/ajhp070506,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18541687/,economics

"Drug cost projections for 1999 and factors that are likely to influence drug costs are discussed. The producer price index indicates that the prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals increased sharply, by an average of 10.2%, during the first 10 months of 1998, compared with just 2.1% for all of 1997; the price of pharmaceutical prescription preparations increased by an average of 17.4% in the first 10 months of 1998-an increase of more than six times the average increase for 1997. In the first quarter of 1998, many generic drugs had major price increases. All these increases may be a sign of considerably higher drug costs in 1999. Group purchasing organizations predict price increases in 1999 of 3% for contracted drugs, 5% for noncontracted drugs, and 8% for current and newly marketed drug products. FDA has been able to decrease the time necessary to approve new drugs under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 and will be expected to decrease the time even further under the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. Increases of 10-12% or more in managed health care coverage rates are being predicted for 1999, with even larger increases expected for fee-for-service plans. Managed care organizations point to the cost of prescription drugs as the major reason for their rate increases. Last year's prediction that we may be entering a period of smaller increases in drug costs was not fulfilled in 1998; all signs point to even higher drug costs in 1999.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/56.1.31,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10048877/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Postdischarge medication management services have been shown to reduce the incidence of medication-related problems during the transition from inpatient to outpatient care. A pharmacist-run transition of care (TOC) program has been developed to reduce the unplanned readmissions of a high-risk managed Medicaid population after hospitalization.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the budget impact of adding an outpatient pharmacy-based TOC program to a medical benefit from the payer perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A budget impact analysis was conducted using a decision-tree model developed in Microsoft Excel. The effect on inpatient and total health care costs from the payer perspective was estimated for the 2-year period following initial hospital discharge. Inputs were based on a total plan population of 240,000 lives, with a high-risk population of 7.5%, of whom 37% were hospitalized and potentially qualified for TOC services, resulting in an eligible population of 6,660 patients. The TOC program was assumed to initially cover 30% of the eligible population, with expansion to 60% over the 2 years. We previously reported that this program reduced the risk of readmission by 32% within 6 months and saved the health plan $2,139 per patient referred to the program, inclusive of program cost, compared with patients receiving usual discharge care. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the impact of uncertainty of model inputs on the results, with the cost of TOC services ranging from $99 to $2,000 per patient referred.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The model showed that the TOC program was cost saving at over $3 per member per month in the first 6 months, which translates to over $25 million in total health care cost savings over 2 years. These results were primarily driven by the estimated reduction in inpatient costs associated with the program, which were estimated at $20 million over the 2 years. Sensitivity analyses illustrated that within all the reasonable ranges of model input parameters, including the upper limit of TOC services set to $2,000 per patient referred, the TOC program resulted in cost savings to the health plan.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The TOC program resulted in potential cost savings of over $25 million to the managed Medicaid plan over a period of 2 years, corresponding to over $4 per member per month.

"One of the fundamental rights of every human being is to enjoy ""the highest attainable standard of health"". Achieving better health requires no only adequate medical knowledge and technologies, laws and social measures in the field of health care, but also sufficient funding for fulfilling people's right to health. However, economic crisis has left every community with limited possibility of investing in health care and forced them to use the available resources more efficiently. This is the reason why health financing policy represents an important and integral part of the health system concerned with how financial resources are generated, allocated and used. Development of new drugs and medical technologies, population aging, increased incidence of chronic diseases as well as the peoples' rising demands from health care providers lead to a constant increase of health system costs worldwide. In these circumstances, countries in transition, like Serbia, face difficult challenges in financing their health systems. Current economic crisis and budget constraints do not allow the Government to simply allocate more public revenues for health and solve the people's expectations by increasing the spending. Instead, Serbia is forced to start reforms to provide a more efficient health system. The reform processes are positioned within the wider context of European integration and public administration reforms. This paper provides a short description of the health care system in Serbia focusing on the healthcare economics and reforms and their influence on financial sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.2298/vsp120205002s,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25536810/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Given limited resources policymakers need to decide about how much and in what areas of health services research (HSR) to invest. The purpose of this study is to provide guidance for priority setting of HSR projects based on economic theory.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The conceptual analysis starts from the premise that competition in health care is valuable-a position that seems to predominate among Western policymakers. The principle of competition rests on economic theory and, in particular, its branch of welfare economics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Based on economic theory, the role of HSR is to detect and alleviate information asymmetry, negative externalities, and harm caused by competition and inappropriate incentives for competition. A hierarchy of HSR projects is provided; following the ethical principle of harm ('do not harm'), the detection and prevention of harm would receive highest priority among HSR projects.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Agreeing that competition is valuable in achieving efficiency and quality of care (and therefore agreeing to the assumptions of economic theory) implies accepting the role of HSR in detecting market failure and the HSR hierarchy as suggested. Disagreement would require an alternative coherent concept of improving efficiency and quality of care.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-016-0768-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26849446/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) is a National HTA Agency in Ireland responsible for assessment of comparative clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and potential budget impact of drugs on behalf of the Health Service Executive. This research aims to assess if the budget impact models submitted to the NCPE have accurate predicted utilisation, assess if the models are consistent in the parameters included, and determine if probabilistic sensitivity analyses would aid the characterization of uncertainty.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis of budget impact models that had been submitted (January 2010-December 2017 inclusive) to the NCPE was performed. The input parameters in the budget impact model were recorded. For each drug, annual realised utilisation was compared with what had been predicted by the respective budget impact model. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also performed on each model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 12 models were included; each model pertained to one drug for one indication. Of the 12 models, six underpredicted and six overpredicted the annual realised utilisation. There were a range of different parameters included in each of the budget impact models. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis did not improve the characterization of uncertainty.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This research has demonstrated that budget impact models submitted to a national HTA agency have limited accuracy in predicting realised utilisation, and there is inconsistency among the parameters included. An electronic budget impact template for applicants has been developed, as a more systematic approach, for their submissions to the NCPE.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-020-01181-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232603/,economics
"Childhood disabilities entail a range of immediate and long-term economic costs that have important implications for the well-being of the child, the family, and society but that are difficult to measure. In an extensive research review, Mark Stabile and Sara Allin examine evidence about three kinds of costs-direct, out-of-pocket costs incurred as a result of the child's disability; indirect costs incurred by the family as it decides how best to cope with the disability; and long-term costs associated with the child's future economic performance. Not surprisingly, the evidence points to high direct costs for families with children with disabilities, though estimates vary considerably within these families. Out-of-pocket expenditures, particularly those for medical costs, for example, are higher among families with children with a special health care need. An important indirect cost for these families involves decisions about employment. Stabile and Allin examine several studies that, taken together, show that having a child with disabilities increases the likelihood that the mother (and less often the father) will either curtail hours of work or stop working altogether. Researchers also find that having a child with disabilities can affect a mother's own health and put substantial strains on the parents' relationship. In the longer term, disabilities also compromise a child's schooling and capacity to get and keep gainful employment as an adult, according to the studies Stabile and Allin review. Negative effects on future well-being appear to be much greater, on average, for children with mental health problems than for those with physical disabilities. Stabile and Allin calculate that the direct costs to families, indirect costs through reduced family labor supply, direct costs to disabled children as they age into the labor force, and the costs of safety net programs for children with disabilities average $30,500 a year per family with a disabled child. They note that the cost estimates on which they base their calculation vary widely depending on the methodology, jurisdiction, and data used. Because their calculations do not include all costs, notably medical costs covered through health insurance, they represent a lower bound. On that basis, Stabile and Allin argue that many expensive interventions to prevent and reduce childhood disability might well be justified by a cost-benefit calculation.",https://doi.org/10.1353/foc.2012.0008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22550686/,economics
"Ireland experienced one of the most severe economic crises of any OECD country. In 2011, a new government came to power amidst unprecedented health budget cuts. Despite a retrenchment in the ability of health resources to meet growing need, the government promised a universal, single-tiered health system, with access based solely on medical need. Key to this was introducing universal free GP care by 2015 and Universal Health Insurance from 2016 onwards. Delays in delivering universal access and a new health minister in 2014 resulted in a shift in language from 'universal health insurance' to 'universal healthcare'. During 2014 and 2015, there was an absence of clarity on what government meant by universal healthcare and divergence in policy measures from their initial intent of universalism. Despite the rhetoric of universal healthcare, years of austerity resulted in poorer access to essential healthcare and little extension of population coverage. The Irish health system is at a critical juncture in 2015, veering between a potential path to universal healthcare and a system, overwhelmed by years of austerity, which maintains the status quo. This papers assesses the gap between policy intent and practice and the difficulties in implementing major health system reform especially while emerging from an economic crisis.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2015.12.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26777302/,economics
"Context:
        
      
      The need for higher efficiency, maximum quality, and faster turnaround time is a continuous focus for anatomic pathology laboratories and drives changes in work scheduling, instrumentation, and management control systems.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the costs of generating routine, special, and immunohistochemical microscopic slides in a large, academic anatomic pathology laboratory using a top-down approach.
    


          Design:
        
      
      The Pathology Economic Model Tool was used to analyze workflow processes at The Nebraska Medical Center's anatomic pathology laboratory. Data from the analysis were used to generate complete cost estimates, which included not only materials, consumables, and instrumentation but also specific labor and overhead components for each of the laboratory's subareas. The cost data generated by the Pathology Economic Model Tool were compared with the cost estimates generated using relative value units.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Despite the use of automated systems for different processes, the workflow in the laboratory was found to be relatively labor intensive. The effect of labor and overhead on per-slide costs was significantly underestimated by traditional relative-value unit calculations when compared with the Pathology Economic Model Tool. Specific workflow defects with significant contributions to the cost per slide were identified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The cost of providing routine, special, and immunohistochemical slides may be significantly underestimated by traditional methods that rely on relative value units. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis may identify specific workflow processes requiring improvement.",https://doi.org/10.5858/2000-0401-oa.1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20670137/,economics
"The results of the empirical analysis in this paper indicate that broadly defined hospital quality declines in more concentrated markets. The direction of the effect of concentration on hospital charges is smaller and the direction is less clear. Prices are little, if any, lower in more concentrated markets. Hospital price-cost margins are higher in more concentrated markets. Higher concentration discourages price competition. The data do not support the increasing monopoly theory. Further, since hospital price-cost margins do not appear to remain constant, we must reject the redundant resources theory as well, though its stress on nonprice competition rings true. The empirical results are consistent with the traditional antitrust theory. In addition, consumer information plays a surprisingly important role. Consumer information is important in explaining hospital prices, and less important in hospital quality. Consumers are not passive; they do play a role in hospital choice. It is likely that more recent innovations in health insurance will increase consumer awareness. With an increase in consumer copayments, and more active insurer contracting, it is likely that future hospital competition is more likely to stress price, and future antitrust activity could lead to price reductions in addition to declining hospital price-cost margins.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-2392-1_11,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10151747/,economics
"This presentation describes a recently developed set of guidelines for estimating the economic costs of substance abuse, summarizes the findings from a Canadian study that utilized these guidelines, and discusses the implications to the potential development of guidelines for estimating the costs and benefits of gambling. The guidelines for estimating the costs of substance abuse present a general framework of costs to be included and discuss methodological issues such as the definition of abuse; determination of causality; comparison of the demographic and human capital approaches; the treatment of private costs; the treatment of nonworkforce mortality and morbidity; the treatment of research, education, law enforcement costs, the estimation of avoidable costs and budgetary impact of substance abuse, and the significance of intangible costs. Utilizing these guidelines, a study was undertaken to estimate the economic costs of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs to Canadian society in 1992. Based on this experience, it is argued that cost/benefit research should be conducted by multidisciplinary teams, that the real value of such work lies more in the detailed findings than in the bottom line results, and that focus should be placed on developing an ongoing process for developing consensus on how to conduct studies of the costs and benefits of gambling, rather than attempting to find a precise methodology that everyone agrees upon.",https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1023633432745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12766470/,economics
"This article argues that gambling is a paradigmatic form of consumption that captures the intensified logic at the heart of late modern capitalist societies. As well as a site of intensified consumption, it claims that gambling has also become the location of what has been described as a new form of 'social pathology' related to excess play. Drawing on Castells' (1996) notion of techno-economic systems, it explores the ways that intersections between technology, capital and states have generated the conditions for this situation, and critiques the unequal distribution of gambling environments that result. It argues that, while the products of these systems are consumed on a global scale, the risks associated with them tend to be articulated in bio-psychological discourses of 'pathology' which are typical of certain types of knowledge that have salience in neo-liberal societies, and which work to conceal wider structural relationships. We argue that a deeper understanding of the political and cultural economy of gambling environments is necessary, and provide a synoptic overview of the conditions upon which gambling expansion is based. This perspective highlights parallels with the wider global economy of finance capital, as well as the significance of intensified consumption, of which gambling is an exemplary instance. It also reveals the existence of a geo-political dispersal of 'harms', conceived as deteriorations of financial, temporal and social relationships, which disproportionately affect vulnerable social groups. From this, we urge an understanding of commercial gambling based on a critique of the wider social body of gambling environments within techno economic systems, rather than the (flawed) individual bodies within them.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24320073/,economics
"In January 1995, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) adopted a voluntary set of principles to provide guidance for its member companies on the conduct and evaluation of pharmacoeconomic research.

Specific recommendations are offered in those methodological areas for which general agreement exists. However, no attempt was made to force a consensus for those methodological issues which have yet to be resolved. The principles address methodology and reporting of research rather than sponsor-investigator relationships or conflict of interest issues, which have been addressed elsewhere.

"Background:
        
      
      The main social contradictions in China have changed: the core concept is high quality development. Health care investment improves the health of residents and promotes regional economic growth.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To analyse the direct and indirect economic effects of health expenditure during 2012-2018 and to test whether China's investment in health care meets the requirements for high quality development.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We selected spatial panel data reflecting the input and output of health resources. We used the knowledge production function and a model of spatial economics to conduct empirical analysis of 31 provinces to show the effects of health expenditure on economic growth.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Economic development (LnGDP) was the dependent variable; explanatory variables included health financial input (LnHI), health personnel input (LnHR), health assets (LnCW) and health insurance expenditure (LnHIE). The regression coefficients for indirect, direct and total effects of LnHI were 0.4346, 0.0623 and 0.4970 respectively (all statistically significant). The direct effect coefficient of LnHR (0.3343) was statistically significant. The regression coefficients for the indirect and total effects were -0.6779 and -0.3436, respectively. The direct, indirect and total effect regression coefficients for LnCW and LnHIE were all statistically significant.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Both LnHI and LnHIE positively promote economic growth within provinces and in neighbouring provinces, i.e. there are direct and indirect positive effects from investing in health care. Increasing the input of health care personnel can promote the economic growth of a province but not that of neighbouring provinces.

"This article analyses the development of Ghana's first private sector health insurance company, the Nationwide Medical Insurance Company. Taking both policy and practical considerations into account (stakeholders' perspectives, economic viability, equity and efficiency), it is structured around key questions which help to define the position and roles of stakeholders--the insurance agency itself, contributors, beneficiaries, and providers--and how they relate to one another and the insurance scheme. These relationships will to a large extent determine Nationwide's long-term success or failure. By creating a unique alliance between physician providers and private sector companies, Nationwide has used employers' interest in cost containment and physicians' interest in expanding their client base as an entrée into the virgin territory of health insurance, and created a hybrid variety of private sector insurance with some of the attributes of a health maintenance organization or managed care. The case study is unusual in that, while public sector programs are often open to academic scrutiny, researchers have rarely had access to detailed data on the establishment of a single private sector insurance company in a developing country. Given that Ghana is planning to launch a national health insurance plan, the article concludes by considering what the experience of this private sector initiative might have to offer public sector planners.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1751(199804/06)13:2<165::aid-hpm505>3.0.co;2-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10185507/,economics
"Large increases in health care costs combined with an economic slowdown have created pressures for health plans and employers to reconsider cost containment strategies that were scaled back after the managed care backlash. In this paper we examine how plans' approaches to cost containment and care management have evolved since 2001. Plans reintroduced and refocused some utilization management techniques during 2002 and 2003 while continuing to invest in disease and case management. Some also began to experiment with new variants of managed care, including tiered provider networks and incentive-based provider payments. However, few respondents believed that these strategies alone would greatly reduce future costs.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w4.427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15451964/,economics
"Nurses expect that professional achievement and dedication to society will reward them with economic security in their later years. Such rewards may not be theirs without deliberate and careful attention to early preparation. This study showed that although nurses expect an adequate income during retirement, their current pension, benefit, and savings status suggests otherwise. Nurses who do not actively manage personal finances or attend to details of employment benefit packages place themselves at distinct risk for economic crisis during their decades of retirement.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005110-199506000-00013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7776010/,economics
"Global warming issues have become a pertinent theme for many economies and policy initiatives. The Indonesian economy is no exception as government officials and stakeholder are working seriously to decouple carbon emission from economic growth. It is on this premise that the present study attempts to investigate the nexus between the environmental implication of offshore economic activities, economic growth, energy use, and environment (CO2) with the integration of foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade openness over recent time series data from 1980 to 2017. A series of analysis were conducted with Pesaran's autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methodology and the Granger causality test as estimation techniques over the outlined variables. Empirical findings from ARDL long-run (elasticity) shows that economic growth is significantly positively associated with carbon emissions at the initial stage but a negative association is established at lags 1 and 2. A significant positive relationship is witnessed between economic growth and FDI. Also, statistical positive relationship is observed between economic growth and energy use, while an inverse relationship is observed between openness and economic growth. For causality analysis, we observe that a uni-directional causality is running from economic growth to foreign direct investment at 5% significant level. This outcome is in support of the growth-induced FDI hypothesis in Indonesia. Furthermore, a one-way causality is seen from energy to openness, CO2 emissions, and from FDI to CO2 emissions while there is a feedback causality between openness and CO2 emissions. The findings of this study have implications to the environmental quality of Indonesia via economic growth; hence, the higher and better the economic growth of the country, the lesser the carbon emissions and the better the environmental quality. This proposition aligns with the pollution halo hypothesis (PHH), where FDI inflow enhances economic growth as well as impacts energy consumption and reduces carbon emissions in the host country.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06352-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31617136/,economics
"The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) developed-in a consultation process with an international expert panel-the efficiency frontier (EF) approach to satisfy a range of legal requirements for economic evaluation in Germany's statutory health insurance system. The EF approach is distinctly different from other health economic approaches. Here, we evaluate established tools for assessing and communicating parameter uncertainty in terms of their applicability to the EF approach. Among these are tools that perform the following: (i) graphically display overall uncertainty within the IQWiG EF (scatter plots, confidence bands, and contour plots) and (ii) communicate the uncertainty around the reimbursable price. We found that, within the EF approach, most established plots were not always easy to interpret. Hence, we propose the use of price reimbursement acceptability curves-a modification of the well-known cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Furthermore, it emerges that the net monetary benefit allows an intuitive interpretation of parameter uncertainty within the EF approach. This research closes a gap for handling uncertainty in the economic evaluation approach of the IQWiG methods when using the EF. However, the precise consequences of uncertainty when determining prices are yet to be defined.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24590819/,economics
"Private insurance market risk pools are likely to be directly affected by expansions of public insurance, in turn affecting premiums. We investigate the effects of Medicaid expansion on private health insurance markets using data on the plans offered through the health insurance ""Marketplaces"" (also known as Exchanges) established by the Affordable Care Act. We employ geographic matching to compare premiums for private plans in neighboring counties that straddle expansion and nonexpansion states and find that premiums of Marketplace plans are 11% lower in Medicaid expansion states, controlling for demographic and health characteristics as well as measures of health care access. These results are consistent with evidence on the composition of the private insurance risk pool in expansion versus nonexpansion states and associated differences in expected health spending.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3809,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30062792/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The challenges of universal health coverage (UHC) in developing countries with a significant proportion of the labor force that works in the informal sector include administrative difficulties in recruiting, registering and collecting regular contributions in a cost-effective way. As most developing countries have a limited fiscal space to support the program in the long run, the fiscal sustainability of UHC, such as that in Indonesia, relies heavily on the contributions of its members. The failure of a large proportion of voluntary enrollees/self-enrolled members/informal sector workers (Peserta Mandiri/Pekerja Bukan Penerima Upah [PBPU] members) to pay their premiums may lead to the National Health Insurance System (NHIS) in Indonesia being unable to effectively deliver its services.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims at exploring the important factors that affect the compliance behavior of informal sector workers (PBPU members) in regularly paying their insurance premium. This analysis may be a basis for designing effective measures to encourage payment sustainability in informal sector workers in the NHIS.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This study utilizes the survey data collected from three regional offices of the Indonesian Social Security Agency for Health (SSAH), which cover approximately 1210 PBPU members, to understand the relationship between members' characteristics and their compliance behavior regarding the premium payment. We applied an econometric analysis of a logit regression to statistically estimate which factors most affect their compliance behavior in paying the insurance premium.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study reveals that almost 28% of PBPU members do not pay their insurance premiums in a sustainable way. Our logistic regression statistically confirms that the number of household members, financial hardship, membership in other social protection arrangements, and the utilization of health services are negatively correlated with the compliance rate of informal sector workers in paying their insurance premium. For instance, people who experience financial hardship tend to have a 7.7 percentage point lower probability of routinely paying the premium. In contrast, households that work in agricultural sectors and have income stability, the cost of inpatient care incurred before joining the NHIS, a comprehensive knowledge of the SSAH's services, and the availability of health professionals are all positively correlated with regular premium payment.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although there is no single policy that can ensure that informal sector workers (PBPU members) regularly pay their premiums, this study recommends some policy interventions, including (1) flexibility in applying for a government subsidy for premiums (Penerima Bantuan Iuran [PBI]), especially for people who have financial hardship; (2) an intensive promotion of insurance literacy; (3) expanding the quantity and quality of healthcare services; and (4) tailor-made policies for ensuring the sustainability of premium payments for each regional division.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-019-00518-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31535352/,economics
"In 2006, the Dutch health insurance system was radically reformed to strengthen competition among health insurers as purchasers of health services. This article considers whether purchaser competition has improved efficiency in health-care provision. Although supply and price regulation still dominates the allocation of health services, purchaser competition has already significantly affected the provision of hospital care, pharmaceuticals and primary care, as well as efforts to gather and disseminate information about quality of care. From this perspective, the glass is half full. However, based on the crude performance indicators available, the reforms have not yet demonstrated significant effects on the performance of the Dutch health system. From this perspective the glass is half empty. The article concludes that the effectiveness of purchaser competition depends crucially on the success of ongoing efforts to improve performance indicators, product classification and the risk equalisation scheme.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133110000381,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21269527/,economics
"This summary section first lists key points from each of the six sections of the report, followed by six key recommendations. The Special Task Force chose to take a health economics approach to the question of whether a health plan should cover and reimburse a specific technology, beginning with the view that the conventional cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year metric has both strengths as a starting point and recognized limitations. This report calls for the development of a more comprehensive economic evaluation that could include novel elements of value (e.g., insurance value and equity) as part of either an ""augmented"" cost-effectiveness analysis or a multicriteria decision analysis. Given an aggregation of elements to a measure of value, consistent use of a cost-effectiveness threshold can help ensure the maximization of health gain and well-being for a given budget. These decisions can benefit from the use of deliberative processes. The six recommendations are to: 1) be explicit about decision context and perspective in value assessment frameworks; 2) base health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions on an evaluation of the incremental costs and benefits of health care technologies as is provided by cost-effectiveness analysis; 3) develop value thresholds to serve as one important input to help guide coverage and reimbursement decisions; 4) manage budget constraints and affordability on the basis of cost-effectiveness principles; 5) test and consider using structured deliberative processes for health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions; and 6) explore and test novel elements of benefit to improve value measures that reflect the perspectives of both plan members and patients.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29477394/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether children and adolescents are selectively enrolled in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) based on age, gender, diagnosis, or prior utilization.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Case-control study. New HMO enrollees were compared with a control population of non-HMO enrollees.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Medicaid claims data and HMO participation records for the Medicaid and Aid to Families of Dependent Children sector in Baltimore, Md.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Controlling for age, significant differences in prior health care utilization as measured by Medicaid expenditures and hospital days were noted. Children enrolling in HMOs had significantly lower prior utilization than children from the control population as measured by dollar expenditures and hospital days. Young children enrolling in HMOs were only half as likely to have prior claims for asthma. Conversely, adolescents enrolling in HMOs had significantly higher prior utilization than adolescents from the control population. The difference among adolescents was due to a higher birth rate among new HMO enrollees in that age bracket.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Voluntary HMO enrollment of children covered by Medicaid and Aid to Families of Dependent Children sector was subject to selection biases that may be economically favorable to the HMOs and may undermine the cost-containment goals of prepaid health care for Medicaid participants. Voluntary capitated systems where fee-for-service remains a significant alternative must monitor for these selection biases that are not allowed for in the adjustments to capitation rates.",https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170300057011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8620232/,economics
"Introduction: In this era of cost-conscious health systems, it is of utmost importance to identify and establish the most cost-effective treatment option. However, in the case of peripheral entrapment mononeuropathies there is alack of data regarding economically effective treatment strategies. Therefore, the objective was to conduct an economic evaluation including both costs and benefits of various treatment strategies applied to peripheral entrapment mononeuropathies to estimate the relative cost-effective treatment regimens.Areas covered: Over the 19 years, seven excellent-high quality economic evaluations of three types of peripheral entrapment mononeuropathies were identified in four countries. Our findings showed that surgery was the most cost-effective therapy followed by same cost efficacy of infiltrative therapy and conservative therapy for peripheral entrapment mononeuropathies. However, the fact that surgery was the most common comparator (n = 6) in our selected studies cannot be neglected.Expert opinion: Due to huge methodological variability, the finding of surgery as the cost-effective treatment strategy remains tentative and the decision about the most suitable clinical and cost-effective therapy should be individualized from case to case. Moreover, the economic evaluation of all possible treatment strategies for peripheral entrapment mononeuropathies over alonger period of analysis is required in future studies.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1919088,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33896326/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      For CAM to feature prominently in health care decision-making there is a need to expand the evidence-base and to further incorporate economic evaluation into research priorities.In a world of scarce health care resources and an emphasis on efficiency and clinical efficacy, CAM, as indeed do all other treatments, requires rigorous evaluation to be considered in budget decision-making.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Economic evaluation provides the tools to measure the costs and health consequences of CAM interventions and thereby inform decision making. This article offers CAM researchers an introductory framework for understanding, undertaking and disseminating economic evaluation. The types of economic evaluation available for the study of CAM are discussed, and decision modelling is introduced as a method for economic evaluation with much potential for use in CAM. Two types of decision models are introduced, decision trees and Markov models, along with a worked example of how each method is used to examine costs and health consequences. This is followed by a discussion of how this information is used by decision makers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Undoubtedly, economic evaluation methods form an important part of health care decision making. Without formal training it can seem a daunting task to consider economic evaluation, however, multidisciplinary teams provide an opportunity for health economists, CAM practitioners and other interested researchers, to work together to further develop the economic evaluation of CAM.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-10-66,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21067622/,economics
"Pharmacotherapy is widely used to manage allergic rhinitis (AR), but often does not adequately control symptoms. Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) should be considered for patients who are not adequately controlled on symptomatic treatment. AIT is gaining attention because of its potential to improve symptom relief and quality of life, and to provide sustained effect after the end of treatment by modifying the course of disease. However, evidence of efficacy needs to be shown for each individual AIT product, based on state-of-the-art studies. The majority of products cannot truly claim efficacy and disease-modifying potential, as evidence of such an effect from robust randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled long-term trials is lacking. The potential of a specific immunotherapy product should be evaluated against four levels of benefit defined by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline on clinical development of AIT products. These clearly distinguish between efficacy of symptom relief in the first year, efficacy over 2-3 treatment years, sustained efficacy and disease modification treatment ends, and sustained absence of allergic symptoms in posttreatment years. The clinician's choice of a specific AIT product should take the level of evidence and risk/benefit into account, as the patient's quality of life and the product's potential long-term effect are important components of its overall cost-effectiveness. Without evidence of maintained clinical benefit and disease modification after the end of treatment, claims of long-term economic benefit of specific AIT products cannot be justified. This paper discusses the evidence that is essential for critical evaluation of product claims in health economic analysis comparing AIT products.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000443272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26824384/,economics

          Intervention(s):
        
      
      We performed a Medline search to identify economic evaluation studies in reproductive medicine. We included studies that concerned interventions, evaluated costs and effects, and were published in a journal on reproductive medicine, gynecology, or a major general journal from 1997 through May 2011.
    


          Main outcome measure(s):

The mean number of quality criteria adhered to was 20 out of 30 items, and only one article met all 30 criteria. The mean number of criteria adhered to was higher if at least one of the authors was from a methodologic or health economics department (mean 23 [n = 30] versus mean 20 [n = 55]). The most common limitations of published economic evaluation studies were in methodology or presentation of incremental analyses, sensitivity analyses, and discounting.

"Background:
        
      
      Evidence from population-based studies on the economic burden imposed by chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCDs) is still sparse in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our study aimed to fill this existing gap in knowledge by estimating both the household direct, indirect, and total costs incurred due to CNCDs and the economic burden households bear as a result of these costs in Malawi.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study used data from the first round of a longitudinal household health survey conducted in 2012 in three rural districts in Malawi. A cost-of-illness method was applied to estimate the economic burden of CNCDs. Indicators of catastrophic spending and impoverishment were used to estimate the economic burden imposed by CNCDs on households.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total 475 out of 5643 interviewed individuals reported suffering from CNCDs. Mean total costs of all reported CNCDs were 1,040.82 MWK, of which 56.8 % was contributed by direct costs. Individuals affected by chronic cardiovascular conditions and chronic neuropsychiatric conditions bore the highest levels of direct, indirect, and total costs. Using a threshold of 10 % of household non-food expenditure, 21.3 % of all households with at least one household member reporting a CNCD and seeking care for such a condition incurred catastrophic spending due to CNCDs. The poorest households were more likely to incur catastrophic spending due to CNCDs. An additional 1.7 % of households reporting a CNCD fell under the international poverty line once considering direct costs due to CNCDs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study showed that the economic burden of CNCDs is high, causes catastrophic spending, and aggravates poverty in rural Malawi, a country where in principle basic care for CNCDs should be offered free of charge at point of use through the provision of an Essential Health Package (EHP). Our findings further indicated that particularly high direct, indirect, and total costs were linked to specific diagnoses, although costs were high even for conditions targeted by the EHP. Our findings point at clear gaps in coverage in the current Malawian health system and call for further investments to ensure adequate affordable care for people suffering from CNCDs.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-016-1716-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27582052/,economics

Economic benefits were derived from client self-reported information at treatment entry and at 6-month postdischarge with the use of an augmented version of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). The average cost of treatment in Specialty programs was US dollars 8035 versus US dollars 1467 for Standard residential treatment. Average net benefits (benefit-cost ratios) were estimated to be US dollars 17144 (3.1) for Specialty and US dollars 8090 (6.5) for Standard.

The optimal regulation scheme is two-sided. On the demand side, it justifies and clarifies value-based reference pricing. On the supply side, it prescribes pay for performance when consumers misperceive service benefits or providers have intrinsic quality incentives. The optimal bonuses are expressed in terms of demand elasticities, service technology, and provider characteristics. However, pay for performance may not outperform prospective payment when consumers are rational and providers are profit maximizing, or when one of the service qualities is not contractible.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2017.11.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29274520/,economics
"The American health care financing system is in a state of crisis. The rising cost of health care and the progressive difficulty Americans are experiencing in accessing the system have produced a great national debate concerning the future of medicine in America. Current health care cost trends, which are not sustainable, are projected to consume 37% of the gross national product by the year 2030. The financing system that supports the health care system is failing. The number of uninsured residents is growing more than twice as fast as the number with health insurance. The legitimate concern about the spiraling cost for medicine has focused attention on seeking root causes. Critics have focused on technology as the single most important factor in driving the cost trends in medicine upward. They have concluded that ""long-term control of the rate of increase in expenditures requires that we curb the development and diffusion of clinically useful technology."" These critics have not made their case, because they base their conclusions on hospital-derived data. These data are inaccurate because of the phenomenon of ""cost-shifting."" The critics do not examine the important issue of productivity and do not have reliable data on the costs and benefits of new technologies. Finally, the critics do not take into account the issue of use and abuse of technology. This is particularly important in the ambulatory environment. To break the health care cost spiral, radiologists, as the keepers of new technology, must commit themselves to at least four fundamental initiatives. The current American hospital-based health system must be replaced with an ambulatory system; productivity must be the primary business goal for radiologists; pricing of new services should reflect actual resources consumed, not the in-patient services displaced; and radiologists must reassert their role as doctors' doctors. The health care cost spiral is a real national crisis. The mission for radiology is to introduce the minimally invasive, ambulatory system of the future. The costs for delivering care within the new system will be a fraction of former costs. My assignment is to present a perspective on the role radiology must play in introducing new imaging technology to medicine. One of the distinguishing features of American society is its fascination with technology. It is only natural that the American health care system reflects this orientation.",https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.163.6.7992715,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7992715/,economics
"Most studies on the indirect costs of an illness and the cost effectiveness of a medical intervention or employer-sponsored wellness program assume that the value of reducing the number of days employees miss from work due to illness is the wage rate. This paper presents a general model to examine the magnitude and incidence of costs associated with absenteeism under alternative assumptions regarding the size of the firm, the production function, the nature of the firm's product, and the competitiveness of the labor market. We conclude that the cost of lost work time can be substantially higher than the wage when perfect substitutes are not available to replace absent workers and there is team production or a penalty associated with not meeting an output target. In the long run, workers are likely to bear much of the incidence of the costs associated with absenteeism, and therefore be the likely beneficiaries of any reduction in absenteeism.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.648,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11921319/,economics
"Pharmaceutical expenditures have grown rapidly in recent decades, and now total nearly 10% of health care costs. Generic drug utilization has risen substantially alongside, from 19% of scripts in 1984 to 47% in 2001, thus tempering expenditure growth through significant direct dollar savings. However, generic drugs may lead to indirect savings as well if their use reduces the average price of those brand-name drugs that are still purchased. Prior work indicates that brand-name producers do not lower their prices in the face of generic competition, and our study confirms that finding. However, prior work is silent on how the mix of consumer choices between generic and brand-name drugs might affect the average price of those brand-name drugs that are purchased. We use a nationally representative panel of data on drug utilization and costs for the years 1996-2001 to examine how the share of an individual's prescriptions filled by generics (generic script share) affects his average out-of-pocket cost for brand-name drugs, and the net cost paid by the insurer. Our principal finding is that a higher generic script share lowers average brand-name prices to consumers, presumably because consumers are more likely to substitute generics when brand-name drugs would cost them more. This effect is substantial: a 10% increase in the consumer's generic script share is associated with a 15.6% decline in the average price paid for brand-name drugs by consumers. This implies that the potential cost savings to consumers from generic substitution are far greater than prior work suggests.

It also provides a huge economic return on investment--whether measured in terms of jobs created, health costs saved, or the dollar value of lives saved.

"Because of the high incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension in the elderly, the treatment of hypertension in this patient group must involve consideration of clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes. The most frequently used method of pharmacoeconomic analysis for antihypertensive therapy involves cost-effectiveness analysis, although several other methods are available. Current evidence reveals a trend toward cost effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients. However, these formal analyses are limited by the need for extrapolation of data regarding efficacy and level of risk from epidemiological and randomised trials, information which is often lacking. To incorporate economic factors into clinical decision making, other measures of economic impact should be explored. The economic impact of antihypertensive therapy is affected by the level of risk for the patient and the efficacy of the treatment. Data indicate that the risk of morbidity and mortality related to hypertension increases with age and that current antihypertensive drugs reduce this risk. When choosing an antihypertensive agent, the following parameters should be considered: acquisition cost, likelihood of adverse effects and other determinants of treatment adherence, and individual predictors of response. The economic outcomes will be maximised if prudent drug selection is supplemented by appropriate diagnostic and classification procedures and reduction of cardiovascular risk factors other than hypertension. The accumulation of data addressing the risks and benefits of therapy for the very old and the comparative efficacy of newer antihypertensive therapies will further clarify the decision-making process.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00002512-200118070-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11482745/,economics
"An interdisciplinary bridge is proposed between principles of collective behavior in biological systems, particularly bicycle pelotons, and the economic phenomenon called the rebound effect. Two main equivalencies are proposed between aspects of peloton dynamics and aspects of energy service efficiencies and the rebound effect. Firstly, a threshold whereby weaker cyclists, up to maximal capacities, sustain speeds of pacesetters by drafting; equivalent to a threshold whereby consumers will not exceed maximum allocated budgets for energy services, costs for which are externally determined. Secondly, a threshold of peloton dynamics whereby, below this threshold, weaker cyclists share costly non-drafting positions, whereas above this threshold cyclists cannot share these positions but can sustain pacesetter speeds. This is in turn equivalent to the threshold in the context of energy service efficiency, whereby consumers will increase spending to the limit indicated by the rebound magnitude but not to their maximum allocated budgets. These thresholds are a consequence of the model equations, and the latter threshold is explained by consumer apprehension that existing energy efficiencies could disappear or be negative, when consumers would be over budget. This partly explains long term rebound increase, whereby consumers increase consumption as confidence rises that cost savings due to energy service efficiency is stable.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155395,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27171407/,economics
"Resource allocation in health care is increasingly guided by financial considerations.

The purposes of this article are to improve the facial plastic surgeon's understanding of cost analyses and to facilitate critical reading of the literature. We describe basic concepts in economic analyses, such as perspective of analysis, the difference between costs and charges, and the importance of discounting. We also introduce the importance of assessing treatment effectiveness and quality of care. In a review of existing cost-based studies in facial plastic surgery, we found a paucity of rigorous treatment analyses.

"This paper seeks to clarify so-called competition strategies for medical care, and to present a more flexible approach for public policy to encourage competition. In so doing, it appears useful to divide a competition strategy into two parts: (1)a structurally sound market mode for the future medical delivery and financing system, and (2) a strategy to implement the chosen model. Policymakers may choose any model that satisfies that structural conditions of a sound market. After listing there principal conditions, this paper presents two distant market models that satisfy them in entirely different ways and a third model that combines the first two. Once a specific market model is chosen, policymakers may choose among a variety of ways to implement it. Some implementation strategies require coercive legislation, others rely more on persuasive leadership, pressures, and incentives. The paper points out that all of these strategies must address certain common action areas: it then proposes one implementation strategy in some detail and uses it to illustrate a way to address each of these area. Although it certainly is not the only possible strategy, the proposal would appear to be practical approach for implementing effective competition.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-7-1-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7050233/,economics
"The lay public, patients and advocates are not usually aware of how decisions are made by health systems, insurers, or governments concerning the availability of medicines provided through national health systems. Today a variety of health economic analyses are undertaken to determine if a particular therapy is cost effective and meets specific criteria to be covered under the national health service programmes. This decision making process is complicated, and in some countries the methodology used is not transparent; these decisions are not adopted in the same way in all countries and often there is no communication or approval required by the public or patient representatives. This is not acceptable from the patient's perspective as effectiveness must remain the criteria and these decisions must be understood and shared in such a way that all stakeholders agree on guidelines for the approval and delivery of new medicines.

"In 1983 the Dutch government introduced a system of hospital budgeting in the Netherlands to contain the increase in health care costs. The budgets were fixed at the real costs in 1983 after an assessment of these costs. A distinction is made between external budgets, which is allocation of resources by external institutions, and internal budgets, which is the allocation within the organization. External budgets should be global; internal budgets should be specific. The influence of the budgeting process on the situation and attitude of physicians is analysed. The budgeting process influences the administration as more and better data are needed to involve heads of departments and physicians in the budgeting process. Specifications of the data in departments, specialisms, and patients seems necessary. The budget process also has its impact on the hospital organization, notably on the position of the physicians and the medical staff, for it tends to integrate them more completely into the organization. There may be a difference between 'the gate specialists' and the specialist heads of service departments. Budget responsibility will be given to all specialists. Finally, the budgeting process affects the quality of patient care. With limited resources, it is necessary to link quality with efficiency in allocating resources. It will probably be necessary to provide more coordination between hospital budgets and specialists' fees.

"This article describes a way to finance universal health care coverage that preserves much of the current financing system and replaces funds obtained from regressive sources with revenue from more progressive ones. New funding would be needed for 24 percent of health expenditures and would be raised through an increase in the federal personal income tax. Premiums are eliminated since their cost is the same to everyone regardless of income. Cost sharing and out-of-pocket spending for medically necessary services are also abolished. In a more equitably financed system, employers would pay a new payroll tax that raised the same amount of money they currently spend for employee health insurance premiums; this would require a payroll tax of about 7 percent. Revenue from an increase in federal personal income taxes would replace household out-of-pocket expenditures for medically necessary services and payments for insurance premiums. For the average, middle-income family, the tax increase would total $731 in 1998.

We first test for the null hypothesis of convergence by employing the methodology proposed in Phillips and Sul (2007) in order to determine whether the evolution of the public health expenditures has followed a similar path across the Spanish regions. This methodology leads us to reject the null hypothesis of convergence, which implies the absence of a unique pattern of behavior in the evolution of the Spanish regional public health expenditures. Instead, we find several convergence clubs which reveal the existence of different patterns of behavior and serious disparities in the Spanish health system. When trying to determine the forces which drive the creation of these clubs, we also find some partisan behavior, in the sense that the longer a right-wing party governs, the lower the per capita public health expenditure in this region of Spain.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.03.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30910477/,economics
"Introduction of the new Pharmaceutical Benefits Board (LFN; 1 October 2002) has markedly changed the principles of pricing and reimbursement of drugs in Sweden.

This study examined experience to date regarding the use of health-economic evaluations and cost-effectiveness information by the LFN. We also describe activities and the use of cost-effectiveness analysis by Swedish local formulary committees organized by the 21 county councils. It is concluded that economic evaluations have supported decision making by LFN, although cost-effectiveness seems to be of varying importance in different situations. While the use of health-economic evaluations and the outcome of decision making by LFN are similar to comparable committees in other countries, there is presently a gap in this sense between the LFN and Swedish local formulary committees.

"Measuring volatility in financial markets is a primary challenge in the theory and practice of risk management and is essential when developing investment strategies. Although the vast literature on the topic describes many different models, two nonparametric measurements have emerged and received wide use over the past decade: realized volatility and absolute return volatility. The former is strongly favored in the financial sector and the latter by econophysicists. We examine the memory and clustering features of these two methods and find that both enable strong predictions. We compare the two in detail and find that although realized volatility has a better short-term effect that allows predictions of near-future market behavior, absolute return volatility is easier to calculate and, as a risk indicator, has approximately the same sensitivity as realized volatility.

"In an era of increasing cost containment in health care, it has become extremely important to allocate resources as efficiently as possible. This implies that formal health economic considerations are taken into account. One of increasing importance is the field of economic appraisal, which allows to quantify the value for money of medical interventions. This research is extremely useful in the field of supportive care of cancer patients. Economic considerations, social, political and ethical issues will also have to be addressed. The sum of these activities will enable us to make better choices in health care and ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to supportive cancer treatment. Cancer patients have physical, social, spiritual and emotional needs. They may suffer from severe physical symptoms, from social isolation, spiritual abandonment, and emotions such as sadness and anxiety, or feelings of deception, helplessness, anger and guilt. In some of them, the disease is rapidly progressing and ultimately they die. Their demanding care evokes intense feelings in health care providers, all the more since these incurable patients represent a challenge, which could be condensed under the heading ""the challenge of medical omnipotence"".

This paper examines the economic and demographic assumptions behind forecasts of Medicare hospital insurance and supplementary medical insurance expenditures and revenues and analyzes various strategies for closing the impending gap.

Shifting more of the burden onto the elderly through increased cost sharing or higher premiums also will not solve the program's fiscal problems over the long term. The remaining alternative--imposing higher income or payroll taxes on the under-65 population--is also unlikely to be a welcome solution.

To date there is little formal documentation of the impact of appraisals. The recent reforms should, in principle, increase the opportunities and demand for economic appraisal. The reforms establish an internal market for health care with separate roles for purchasers and providers. There are opportunities for using appraisals in deciding whether or not to place a contract, in deciding on the contract specification and in monitoring the prescribing budgets of general medical practitioners.

"Objective:
        
      
      Growing interest in the use of drug-eluting stents (DESs) in coronary angioplasty has prompted the Healthcare Agency of the Emilia Romagna Region to draw up recommendations for their appropriate clinical use in high-risk patients. Since the adoption of any new technology necessitates economic appraisal, we analysed the resource consumption of the various types of angioplasty procedures and the impact on the budget of a cardiology department.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective economic appraisal was carried out on the coronary angioplasty procedures performed in 2004 in the Department of Interventional Cardiology of Reggio Emilia. On the basis of the principles of activity-based costing, detailed hospital costs were estimated for each procedure and compared with the relevant diagnosis-related group (DRG) reimbursement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 2004, the Reggio Emilia hospital performed 806 angioplasty procedures for a total expenditure of euro 5,176,268. These were 93 plain old balloon angioplasty procedures (euro 487,329), 401 procedures with bare-metal stents (euro 2,380,071), 249 procedures with DESs (euro 1,827,386) and 63 mixed procedures (euro 481,480). Reimbursements amounted to euro 5,816,748 (11% from plain old balloon angioplasty, 50% from bare-metal stent, 31% from DES and 8% from mixed procedures) with a positive margin of about euro 680,480 between costs incurred and reimbursements obtained, even if the reimbursement for DES and mixed procedures was not covering all the incurred costs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Analysis of the case-mix of procedures revealed that an overall positive margin between costs and DRG reimbursements was achieved. It therefore emerges that adherence to the indications of the Healthcare Agency of the Emilia Romagna Region for the appropriate clinical use of DESs is economically sustainable from the hospital enterprise point of view, although the DRG reimbursements are not able to differentiate among resource consumptions owing to the adoption of innovative technologies.",https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0b013e328012c1b6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17885516/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this paper is to quantify the impact of socio-economic characteristics on out-of pocket expenditures for prescribed medications in Tajikistan and provide recommendations for healthcare sector reform. The research question in this paper is: what household, personal, economic, and health factors help explain expenditures on medications? From a theoretical perspective, this paper contributes to the on-going discussion of out-of-pocket expenditures in Tajikistan. From a practical perspective, in line with this recent development in the Tajikistan healthcare sector, it helps to develop evidence-based decision-making by answering practical questions: what factors affect pattern of out-of-pocket expenditures for prescribed medication? Which groups of the population should be granted a discount or fee-waiver when buying them?
    


          Design/methodology/approach:
        
      
      Based on micro-file data from the most recent cross-sectional nationally-representative survey of Tajik households, this paper develops and tests a multivariate model of identifying determinants of out-of-pocket expenditures on prescribed medications in Tajikistan.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The paper finds that economic status, chronic illness, disability, number of small children, short supply of necessary drugs, and cardiac and acute illnesses are the strongest determinants of spending for prescribed medications in the country.
    


          Originality/value:
        
      
      This paper demonstrates that to ensure accessibility to and affordability of prescribed medications, discounts or fee-waivers should be granted to specific categories of households, those in poverty, with chronically ill members and with small children. These discounts or fee-waivers should cover prescribed medications for children, long-standing illness as well as for cardiac and acute infectious diseases. Administrative and economic measures should be taken to reduce the extra costs incurred due to the shortage of prescribed medications. Hence, these findings can be used in developing and designing reforms in the Tajikistan healthcare sector.",https://doi.org/10.1108/14777260910960911,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19711776/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The distribution of medical resources in China is seriously imbalanced due to imbalanced economic development in the country; unbalanced distribution of medical resources makes patients try to seek better health services. Against this backdrop, this study aims to analyze the spatial network characteristics and spatial effects of China's health economy, and then find evidence that affects patient mobility.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data for this study were drawn from the China Health Statistical Yearbooks and China Statistical Books. The gravitational value of China's health spatial network was calculated to establish a network of gravitational relationships. The social network analysis method was used for centrality analysis and spillover effect analysis.

      A gravity correlation matrix was constructed among provinces by calculating the gravitational value, indicating the spatial relationships of different provinces in the health economic network. Economically developed provinces, such as Shanghai and Jiangsu, are at the center of the health economic network (centrality degree = 93.333). These provinces also play a strong intermediary role in the network and have connections with other provinces. In the CONCOR analysis, 31 provinces are divided into four blocks. The spillover effect of the blocks indicates provinces with medical resource centers have beneficial effects, while provinces with insufficient resources have obvious spillover effects.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is a significant gap in the geographical distribution of medical resources, and the health economic spatial network structure needs to be improved. Most medical resources are concentrated in economically developed provinces, and these provinces' positions in the health economic spatial network are becoming more centralized. By contrast, economically underdeveloped regions are at the edge of the network, causing patients to move to provinces with medical resource centers. There are health risks of the increasing pressure to seek medical treatment in developed provinces with abundant medical resources.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031096,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33530638/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The authors investigated the extent and characteristics of published psychiatric research from U.S. and Canadian medical schools that was carried out without external funding.
    


          Method:
        
      
      They reviewed reports of unfunded research in 14 psychiatric journals, tabulating methodological factors and topics of study. They surveyed first authors about their academic duties and resources used in the studies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Unfunded studies represented 26% of research reports, were usually prospective, most commonly dealt with phenomenology/epidemiology or psychopharmacology, used low levels of technology, and were accomplished on a modest budget of time and money.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Unfunded studies make a substantial and economically efficient contribution to psychiatric research.

"The Medicare program, the largest health insurance program in the United States, is clearly at a crossroads as it enters its third decade. Historical increases in health care expenditures, plus a changing political and economic landscape, have set the groundwork for policy reform. Two basic reform strategies--reimbursement arrangements and program funding mechanisms--are discussed. In 1983, Congress enacted the Prospective Payment System (PPS) which initiated a fundamental change in the way hospitals are paid for care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. But the PPS is only a stepping-stone to broader reforms such as capitation. In addition, new methods of program funding may be necessary, especially in light of policymakers' considerations of coverage of services such as long-term care and organ transplants.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0169-2607(87)90055-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3315430/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The introduction of new technology has increased the hospital cost of THA. Considering the impending epidemic of hip osteoarthritis in the United States, the projections of THA prevalence, and national cost-containment initiatives, we are concerned about the decreasing economic feasibility of hospitals providing THA.
    


          Questions/purposes:
        
      
      We compared the hospital cost, reimbursement, and profit/loss of THA over the 1990 to 2008 time period.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed the hospital accounting records of 104 patients in 1990 and 269 patients in 2008 who underwent a unilateral primary THA. Hospital revenue, hospital expenses, and hospital profit (loss) for THA were evaluated and compared in 1990, 1995, and 2008.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 1990 to 2008, hospital payment for primary THA increased 29% in actual dollars, whereas inflation increased 58%. Lahey Clinic converted a $3848 loss per case on Medicare fee for service, primary THA in 1990 to a $2486 profit per case in 1995 to a $2359 profit per case in 2008. This improvement was associated with a decrease in inflation-adjusted revenue from 1995 to 2008 and implementation of cost control programs that reduced hospital expenses. Reduction of length of stay and implant costs were the most important drivers of expense reduction. In addition, the managed Medicare patient subgroup reported a per case profit of only $650 in 2008.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      If hospital revenue for THA decreases to managed Medicare levels, it will be difficult to make a profit on THA. The use of technologic enhancements for THA add to the cost problem in this era of healthcare reform. Hospitals and surgeons should collaborate to deliver THA at a profit so it will be available to all patients. Government healthcare administrators and health insurance payers should provide adequate reimbursement for hospitals and surgeons to continue delivery of high-quality THAs.

"Horizontal and vertical mergers, and coalition and network building activity have recently escalated in the US hospital industry in response to actual and threatened increases in competition. Parties to this industry's consolidation state that increased efficiency is the primary motive. However, increased consolidation may lead to increased awareness of inter-dependence, and facilitate 'conscious parallelism', or tacit collusion. In conjunction with this, selective contracting practices by payors with hospitals for negotiated prices may have increased the awareness of interdependence among price-competing hospitals. We posit that cost asymmetries arising from first-mover advantages to merged hospitals and multihospital chain members may be used strategically in local markets to facilitate tacit arrival at profit maximizing prices. Thus, hospital mergers and acquisitions which enhance efficiency in the short run may not yield net gains to society in the long run, as they may alter incentives which parameterize the potential for implicit cooperation. This outcome depends upon mitigating local market conditions, such as capacity utilization and market power held by payors. The current view that safeguarding emerging price competition is important necessitates careful analysis of how merger is likely to affect bargaining power between hospitals and purchasers. This complexity precludes the use of simple antitrust rules or guidelines in this industry.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199605)5:3<183::aid-hec199>3.0.co;2-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8817294/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition that afflicts young adults in their economically productive years. The goal of this study was to determine the costs of IBD in Germany from a societal perspective, using cost diaries.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Members of the German Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Association who had IBD were recruited by post, and those who agreed to participate documented their IBD-associated costs prospectively in a diary over 4 weeks. They documented their use of healthcare facilities, medications, sick leave and out-of-pocket expenditures, as well as general demographic information, the status and history of their IBD, and long-term disability. Item costs were calculated according to national sources. Cost data were calculated using non-parametric bootstrapping and presented as mean costs (year 2004) over 4 weeks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cost diaries were returned by 483 subjects (Crohn's disease: n = 241, ulcerative colitis: n = 242) with a mean age of 42 years and an average disease duration of 13 years (SD +/- 8.09). The cost diaries were regarded as 'easy to complete' by 89% of participants. The mean 4-week costs per subject were 1,425 Euros(95% CI 1201, 1689) for Crohn's disease and 1,015 Euros(95% CI 832, 1258) for ulcerative colitis. Of the total costs for Crohn's disease, 64% were due to indirect costs such as early retirement or sick leave and 32% were due to direct medical costs. In contrast, of the total costs for ulcerative colitis, 41% were due to direct medical costs and 54% to indirect costs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the first comprehensive cost study for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in Germany. The most important economic factors that influenced the cost profiles of both diseases were the long-term productivity losses due to an ongoing inability to work and the cost of medications. Results indicate significant cost differences between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This data provides initial cost estimates that can be analysed further with respect to cost determinants and disease-specific costs in the future.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200624080-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16898849/,economics
"The valuation of urban water management practices and associated nature-based solutions (NBS) is highly contested, and is becoming increasingly important to cities seeking to increase their resilience to climate change whilst at the same time facing budgetary pressures. Different conceptions of 'values' exist, each being accompanied by a set of potential measures ranging from calculative practices (closely linked to established market valuation techniques) - through to holistic assessments that seek to address wider concerns of sustainability. Each has the potential to offer important insights that often go well beyond questions of balancing the costs and benefits of the schemes concerned. However, the need to address - and go beyond - economic considerations presents policy-makers, practitioners and researchers with difficult methodological, ethical and practical challenges, especially when considered without the benefit of a broader theoretical framework or in the absence of well-established tools (as might apply within more traditional infrastructural planning contexts, such as the analysis of transport interventions). Drawing on empirical studies undertaken in Sheffield over a period of 10 years, and delivered in partnership with several other European cities and regions, we compare and examine different attempts to evaluate the benefits of urban greening options and future development scenarios. Comparing these different approaches to the valuation of nature-based solutions alongside other, more conventional forms of infrastructure - and indeed integrating both 'green and grey' interventions within a broader framework of infrastructures - throws up some surprising results and conclusions, as well as providing important sign-posts for future research in this rapidly emerging field.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.05.043,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28646717/,economics
"The Northern Territory intends to make use of Australian National Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) and their cost relativities as the basis for the allocation of budgets among public hospitals. The study reported here attempted to assess the extent to which there are variations in severity of illness and socio-economic status which are not adequately explained by DRG alone and, if so, to develop a DRG payment adjustment index by use of routinely available data items. The investigation was undertaken by use of a database containing all discharges between July 1992 and June 1995. Hospital length of stay was used as a proxy for cost. Multivariate analysis was undertaken and it was found that several variables were associated with cost variations within DRGs. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop a model in which 14 variables were able to explain 45% of the variations. Index values were subsequently computed from the regression model for each of eight categories of admitted patient episodes which are the intersections of three binary variables: Aborigine or non-Aborigine, rural or urban usual place of residence of the patient and hospital type (teaching or other).

"Background:
        
      
      There is a growing interest in incorporating informal care in cost-of-illness studies as a relevant part of the economic impact of some diseases.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this paper was to review the recent literature valuating the costs of informal care in a group of selected diseases from 2005 to 2015.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We carried out a systematic review on the economic impact of informal care, focusing on six selected diseases: arthritis or osteoarthritis, cancer, dementia, mental diseases, multiple sclerosis and stroke.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We selected 91 cost-of-illness articles. The average weight attributed to the informal care cost over the total cost was highly relevant for dementia, stroke, mental diseases, cancer and multiple sclerosis. The most frequent valuation method applied was the opportunity cost method, followed by the proxy good method. The annual cost of informal care presented a high variability depending on the disease and geographic location. Distinguishing by type of illness, the disease with the highest annual value of informal caregiving was dementia, followed by mental illness and multiple sclerosis. The average hourly unit cost was €11.43 (2015 values), varying noticeably depending on the geographic location.
    


          Conclusion:

"Background:
        
      
      Little research has focused on the economic hardship among the insured with severe illnesses and high treatment costs, in particular, the consequence of poorer insurance coverage for high-cost illnesses. Therefore, we presented the case for identifying the experiences of insured patients with severe chronic and acute illnesses. This study identified a qualitative understanding of the economic impact of severe chronic and acute illnesses and household strategies to deal with high treatment costs.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Interviews were conducted with 19 insured households of three different health insurance programs with a family member that had been hospitalized for severe chronic or acute illnesses in either Banyumas or Margono Sukarjo hospitals in Banyumas, Central Java, Indonesia. A thematic analysis was applied to guide the interpretation of the data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Insured households with a family member that had been hospitalized for severe chronic and acute illnesses were greatly affected by the high treatment costs. Four major issues emerged from this qualitative study: insured patients are still burdened with high out-of-pocket payments, households adopt various strategies to cope with the high cost of treatments, households experience financial hardships, and positive and negative perceptions of the insured regarding their health insurance coverage for acute and chronic illnesses.

      Askes and Jamsostek patients faced financial burdens from high cost sharing for hospital amenities, non-covered drugs, and treatments and other indirect costs. Meanwhile, Jamkesmas beneficiaries faced no financial burden for related medical services but were rather burdened with indirect costs for the carers. Households relied on internal resources to cover hospital bills as the first strategy, which included the mobilization of savings, sale of assets, and borrowing of money. External support was tapped secondarily and included financial support from extended family members, donations from neighbors and the community, and additional benefits from employers. However, insured households overall had positive perceptions of insurance.",https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.22526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25308817/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Affordability may be defined as the absence of economic barriers to a good or service. There are 2 frequently observed measures of affordability: a consumer's ability to pay and his or her physical access to a good or service. Thus, most programs designed to subsidize consumers' health care costs, especially state programs that address prescription drug expenditures for people aged > or =65 years, base eligibility on measures of income as a proxy for a consumer's ability to pay. These measures do not explicitly include a consumer's willingness to pay for medications. For example, it is possible that some Medicare beneficiaries may be resistant to paying for medication because other major health care expenditures are typically covered by insurance. This resistance could be exacerbated by the keen awareness among the general population of the rising costs of medications. Because medications are considered a necessity, expenditure levels are usually compared with expenditures for other necessities, such as housing and medical services.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In an attempt to assess consumers' potential willingness to pay for medications, this article draws on data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Surveys to compare pharmaceutical expenditures with out-of-pocket expenditures for discretionary purchases, such as dining outside the home.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Personal out-of-pocket expenditures for medications have ranged from 0.8% to 1.0% of consumer unit income since 1985. These expenditures are relatively small compared with those for necessities, such as housing (33%) and food (13.5%). They are also less than the share of income dedicated to many nonessentials.

Clinical microeconomics offers an approach to understanding cost and outcomes in an environment of economic scarcity. In this article the types of costs and methods for determining cost are presented. In addition, methods for assessing outcome and outcome in relation to cost are developed. Restenosis after coronary angioplasty is a prime example of a clinical problem requiring economic evaluation. This is because it results in little serious morbidity except for recurrent chest pain, but it has serious economic consequences which occur some time after the original angioplasty.

"Significant prepayment of health care is a crucial factor to ensure that all individuals have access to effective health services at affordable prices. The research questions we address here are as follows: What role does economic growth play in changing the level of health care prepayment? Does government's willingness to spend more on health mean higher prepayment rates in the health financing system? What are their dynamic relationships? These questions are addressed in China over the 1978 to 2014 period by employing the continuous wavelet analysis. We focus in particular on their correlations and lead-lag relationships across different frequency bands. Our findings clearly show that overall government willingness has a positive effect on health care prepayment level, while the impact of economic growth varies in the time-frequency domain. This variation could be demonstrated in 1980 to 1998, when the positive correlation between economic growth and health care prepayment level in the short term turned negative in the medium and long term, which indicated that China could not achieve mutual development of economic growth and social welfare within the market-oriented health system. Notably, the time-varying analysis indicates that China's new round of medical system reform since 2006 plays an important role in changing the correlations and lead-lag relationships. In particular, health care prepayment tended to lead government willingness during the 2006 to 2012 period since the increase of health subsidies and expenditures strengthened government responsibility over the health sector, and there existed a persistent mutual stimulation between economic growth and health care prepayment level across all frequency bands along with the reform.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30378707/,economics
"This study analyzes the effect of episode-of-care payment and patient choice on waiting time and the comprehensive quality of hospital care. The study assumes that two hospitals are located in two cities with different population sizes and compete with each other. We find that the comprehensive quality of hospital care as well as waiting time of both hospitals improve with an increase in payment per episode of care. However, we also find that the extent of these improvements differs according to the population size of the cities where the hospitals are located. Under the realistic assumptions that hospitals involve significant labor-intensive work, we find the improvements in comprehensive quality and waiting time in a hospital located in a small city to be greater than those in a hospital located in a large city. The result implies that regional disparity in the quality of hospital care decreases with an increase in payment per episode of care.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-012-0396-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22614264/,economics
"This paper discusses some of the economic issues which underpin the rationale for investment in information and communications technologies (ICTs). Information imperfections lead to significant transaction costs (search, negotiating and monitoring) which in turn confer a negative externality on parties involved in exchange. This divergence in private and social costs leads to a degree of resource misallocation (efficiency loss) which, uncorrected, results in a sub-optimal outcome. Traditional solutions to this problem are to rely upon direct government action to reduce the costs of transacting between market agents, or to employ tax/subsidy measures and other legislative action to achieve the desired market outcome. Three key policy questions are raised in the context of the NHS purchaser/provider relationship. Firstly, what is the optimum level of transaction costs; secondly, can ICTs assist in lowering the level of transaction costs to the optimum level; thirdly, who should bear the investment cost in reducing the level of transaction costs? The issue of property rights in different information systems is discussed and raises interesting policy questions about how much investment should be undertaken centrally rather than devolved to a more local level. In some ways this economic framework offers a post hoc justification of why different ICT systems have been introduced at various levels of the NHS. Essentially this reduces to the problem of externalities: providing good information confers a positive externality: not providing relevant, timely and accurate information confers a negative externality, by increasing further the level of transaction costs. The crucial role which ICT systems can play lies in attempting to reduce the level of transaction costs and driving the market towards what Dahlman has described as the transaction-cost-constrained equilibrium.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199601)5:1<25::aid-hec181>3.0.co;2-f,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653190/,economics

          Design:
        
      
      Systematic review.
    


          Evidence review:
        
      
      A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus in September 2017. Studies quantifying the cost of medication non-adherence in relation to economic impact were included. Relevant information was extracted and quality assessed using the Drummond checklist.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-nine individual studies assessing the cost of medication non-adherence across 14 disease groups were included. Wide-scoping cost variations were reported, with lower levels of adherence generally associated with higher total costs. The annual adjusted disease-specific economic cost of non-adherence per person ranged from $949 to $44 190 (in 2015 US$). Costs attributed to 'all causes' non-adherence ranged from $5271 to $52 341. Medication possession ratio was the metric most used to calculate patient adherence, with varying cut-off points defining non-adherence. The main indicators used to measure the cost of non-adherence were total cost or total healthcare cost (83% of studies), pharmacy costs (70%), inpatient costs (46%), outpatient costs (50%), emergency department visit costs (27%), medical costs (29%) and hospitalisation costs (18%). Drummond quality assessment yielded 10 studies of high quality with all studies performing partial economic evaluations to varying extents.

      Medication non-adherence places a significant cost burden on healthcare systems. Current research assessing the economic impact of medication non-adherence is limited and of varying quality, failing to provide adaptable data to influence health policy. The correlation between increased non-adherence and higher disease prevalence should be used to inform policymakers to help circumvent avoidable costs to the healthcare system. Differences in methods make the comparison among studies challenging and an accurate estimation of true magnitude of the cost impossible. Standardisation of the metric measures used to estimate medication non-adherence and development of a streamlined approach to quantify costs is required.

"The rise of applied biology was one of the most striking feature of the biological sciences in the early 20th century. Strongly oriented toward agriculture, this was closely associated with the growth of a number of disciplines, notably, entomology and mycology. This period also saw a market expansion of the English University system, and biology departments in the newly inaugurated civic universities took an early and leading role in the development of applied biology through their support of Economic Biology. This sought explicitly to promote the application of biological knowledge to economically important problems and especially to agriculture. The impact of Economic Biology was felt most strongly within Zoology, where it became synonymous with entomology. The transience of Economic Biology belies its significance, for example, in providing a means for the expansion of biology at the civic universities. More broadly, it opened up new research and employment opportunities within the life sciences. In late Edwardian Britain, newly available state funds for agriculturally relevant biological disciplines transformed the life sciences. This paper examines the impact of these funds - mobilized either under the 1909 Development Act, or under the auspices of colonial interests - on Economic Biology and the institutionalization of applied biology. The rise and fall of Economic Biology casts new light on the way in which institutional and political alignments profoundly shaped the development of British biology.",https://doi.org/10.1023/b:hist.0000038268.39357.28,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15490520/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The socio-economic impact of bipolar disorder in the UK is unknown.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To estimate the annual socio-economic burden imposed by bipolar disorder on UK society.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The annual cost of resource use attributable to managing bipolar disorder was calculated. Indirect societal costs were also calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The annual National Health Service (NHS) cost of managing bipolar disorder was estimated to be 199 million pounds sterling , of which hospital admissions accounted for 35%. The annual direct non-health-care cost was estimated to be 86 million pounds sterling annually and the indirect societal cost was estimated to be 1770 million pounds sterling annually.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The annual cost to UK society attributable to bipolar disorder was estimated to be 2 billion pounds sterling at 1999/2000 prices (estimated 297 000 people with the disorder). Ten per cent of this cost is attributable to NHS resource use, 4% to non-health-care resource use and 86% to indirect costs.",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.180.3.227,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11872515/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The prime objective of this study was to investigate whether sponsorship by the pharmaceutical industry affected the results of full economic evaluations (FEE) based on modeling. In particular, we focused on the flourishing literature based on Markov models, by far the most widely exploited tool for estimating lifetime costs and benefits.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We made a literature search of the international database PubMed to find all the studies on pharmacological treatments based on Markov models published in English in the period January 1, 2004 to June 30, 2009. We selected the FEEs focused on single drugs only, specifically cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. Two hundred articles including FEEs based on Markov models were considered eligible. For the analysis, we classified the FEEs into two groups according to whether or not they had financial backing from the pharmaceutical industry. We then assessed the main conclusions, which were classified as (i) ""favorable,"" (ii) ""doubtful,"" and (iii) ""unfavorable.""
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 200 articles, 138 (69 percent) were sponsored and 162 (81 percent) reached favorable conclusions. Sponsored studies were much more likely to report favorable conclusions than nonsponsored ones (95 percent and 50 percent, p < .001), the former even omitting unfavorable conclusions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The review found a substantial share of studies supported by the pharmaceutical industry, almost all concluding in favor of the drug studied, without any unfavorable conclusions at all. These results confirm also in the field of pharmacoeconomic studies that the best way of limiting confounding factors is by clearly distinguishing assessors from manufacturers and marketers of any new technology.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462310000322,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20584363/,economics
"In the course of establishing the discourse of public health ethics in Germany, we discuss whether economic efficiency should be part of public health ethics and, if necessary, how efficiency should be conceptualized. Based on the welfare economics theory, we build a theoretical framework that demands an integration of economic rationality in public health ethics. Furthermore, we consider the possible implementation of welfare efficiency against the background of current practice in an economic evaluation of health care in Germany. The indifference of the welfare efficiency criterion with respect to distribution leads to the conclusion that efficiency must not be the only criteria of public health ethics. Therefore, an ethical approach of principles should be chosen for public health ethics. Possible conflicts between principles of such an approach are outlined.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-009-0836-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19330273/,economics

I look at these three debates holistically and present a welfare theoretic model that is consistent with the practice of CEA and can help inform all of these three debates.

"Background:
        
      
      Though psoriasis poses a substantial chronic socio-economic burden, few studies have addressed the economic impact in Germany.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objective was to evaluate the annual costs of psoriasis in Germany from the societal perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study was performed in randomly selected German dermatology practices and clinics in 2013/2014 using standardized questionnaires of illness-related costs. Costs were grouped by perspective and category as well as analysed by sex and age. Group differences were tested by non-parametric tests.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Complete data were obtained from 1158 patients in 132 centres. Annual average costs for patients with psoriasis: total costs € 5543 ± € 8044, systemic treatment costs (paid by the statutory health insurances [SHI]) € 3733 ± € 7322, out-of-pocket costs € 224 ± € 406, total SHI costs € 4940 ± € 7533, direct costs € 5164 ± € 7581 and indirect costs € 379 ± € 2087. Significant higher costs in male and significant lower costs in 65+-year-old patients were found.
    


          Conclusions:

This study examines the effect of multiple prior years of health expenditures on the probability of enrollment in a Medicare HMO. Beneficiaries may require more than one year of prior expenditure data to form a reliable estimate of future expenditures if health expenditures have a significant transitory component. We used a logit model to estimate the influence of 1991-1993 Part A expenditures and demographic data on the choice of health plans in 1994. The results indicate that beneficiaries use multiple years of expenditures in their choice of health plan and the effect of prior spending declined with time.,https://doi.org/10.1023/b:ihfe.0000036049.40865.72,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277781/,economics
"In plastic surgery, 2 predominant practice environments exist, namely, the academic setting and private practice. These 2 groups cater their practice toward the needs and demands of 2 very different patient populations. The goal of this paper is to examine well-established economic indicators and delineate their relationship, if any, with the volume of different plastic surgical procedures performed in the United States. Information from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons' annual reports on plastic surgery statistics was collected from the year 2000 through 2010 and compared to readily available and established economic indicators. There was a significant positive relationship with total cosmetic procedures and gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, personal income, consumer price index (CPI) (all), and CPI (medical). There was a significant positive relationship between cosmetic surgical procedures and the issuance of new home permits and the average prime rate charged by banks. There was a significant positive relationship with cosmetic minimally invasive procedures and GDP, GDP per capita, personal income, CPI (all), and CPI (medical). There was a significant negative relationship between reconstructive procedures and GDP, GDP per capita, personal income, CPI (all), and CPI (medical). Cosmetic minimally invasive procedures seem to be decided on relatively quickly during good economic times. Cosmetic surgical procedures seem to be more planned and less related to the economic environment. The plastic surgeon may use this relationship to tailor the focus of his or her practice to be best situated for economic fluctuations.",https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e31824a4393,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22964673/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Tobacco tax rates set by various governments are not based on the idea that tax receipts should cover the costs incurred by smoking. It can be assumed that tobacco tax receipts (TTR) differ from the costs of smoking. The aim is to determine the global basic economic gap (BEG) between TTR and the economic costs of smoking-attributable diseases (ECS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      BEG is described as the difference between the ECS and TTR. A total of 124 countries representing 94% of global tobacco consumption were included in the research by means of the creation of a database, the adjustment of input data and the identification of their intersection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The global BEG reaches US$1438 billion per year. The global ECS are US$1911 billion per year. The global TTR are US$473 billion per year and compensate for only one quarter of the ECS. Within countries with the highest consumption of cigarettes, especially the USA but also Russia and Germany, the proportion of the ECS covered by the TTR is even lower, although private health expenditures have been taken into account.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our findings suggest that tobacco taxes would have to be globally increased by more than four times on average in order to cover the ECS or between two and two-and-a-half times if we take private health expenditures into account. The informational pressure concerning health risks associated with smoking aimed at reducing harmful consumption and improving global health can also be supported with these economic facts.",https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054307,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30282775/,economics
"The Mediterranean region is highly vulnerable to undesired consequences of global warming triggered by industrialization, urbanization, and mostly fossil energy consumption. However, the region has also great renewable energy generation potential such as solar and wind, which enables countries in the region to considerably mitigate CO2 emissions, the main driver of global warming. Developing countries around the world have less impact on carbon emissions than the developed Global North. Therefore, developing countries in the Mediterranean region are affected by the carbon burden of the first industrialized and developed European countries. This study investigates the role of economic growth, fossil and renewable energy consumption, and urbanization of developing Mediterranean countries in CO2 emissions by using annual data covering 1995-2016 period. To this end, it follows a STIRPAT model including gross domestic product per capita, urbanization, and renewable and non-renewable energy consumption. Considering cross correlation among countries, panel data methodologies are employed to estimate how carbon emissions respond to increase in gross domestic product, urbanization, and disaggregated energy consumption. Empirical results reveal that gross domestic product and fossil energy increase CO2 emissions; urbanization and renewable energy decrease CO2 emissions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14860-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34132967/,economics
"In 1990, Kupat Holim Clalit (KHC), Israel's largest health insurance fund, initiated a demonstration program for transforming primary care clinics in the Negev district of southern Israel into autonomous budget-holding units. Four program components were implemented in nine clinics: allocation of a fixed budget; expansion of day-to-day decision-making authority; establishment of a computerized information system for producing monthly reports on expenditure; and provision of incentives for budgetary responsibility (returning part of a clinic's savings for use at its discretion). The demonstration program had three objectives: budgetary control and cost containment; improvement of services and increased client satisfaction; and improvement in the motivation, initiative, responsibility, and satisfaction of clinic staff. This report presents interim findings from an evaluation study of the budget-holding program conducted in 1991-1992. The report considers three questions: How was the demonstration program implemented? Did work procedures in the clinics change following implementation of the program? How did budget-holding influence levels of expenditure in the clinics? The program components were implemented gradually in the nine clinics during 1991-1992. Not all, however, were fully implemented. The staff survey conducted after implementation of the program identified a number of changes in the work procedures of the clinics: heightened cost consciousness, discussion of the monthly expenditure reports, emphasis on the need to economize, and attempts to economize. Data on expenditure in the budget-holding clinics were analyzed and compared to data on expenditure in primary care clinics in the Negev district as a whole. It was found that while the average quarterly per capita expenses in the district increased in real terms from 1991-1992, expenses in the budget-holding clinics remained stable or, in some cases, actually decreased. While we cannot conclude categorically from the existing data that the budget-holding program is responsible for the unique patterns of expenditure in the nine clinics, we can confidently state that work procedures in the nine clinics changed following implementation of the program and that the clinics achieved cost containment relative to the district as a whole. Findings from the various research tools support one another, and reinforce the conclusion that budget-holding can potentially promote cost containment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(95)00359-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8844922/,economics
"In this paper we critically appraise the appropriateness and validity from an economic perspective of alternative preference-based approaches to measuring outcomes in economic evaluations of health care interventions. We describe the properties of an outcome measure for economic evaluation to make it compatible with the principles of economics when applied to the problem of resource allocation. We also describe the difference and similarities between the psychometric and the economic approaches for the measurement of outcome. Using these properties we critically appraise the use of QALY and HYE methods of measuring individual and social preferences for health outcome. We argue that the most advanced measure currently available that meets these required properties is the HYE. Because the HYE, unlike the QALY, has its foundations in utility theory under uncertainty, it neither assumes particular formulations of the individual utility function, nor is it incompatible with the principles of economics. As such it represents a further stage in the continuing development of methods for economic evaluation of health care programmes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)e0109-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7747211/,economics
"The aim of this article was to present a general overview of the health care system as well as pricing and reimbursement environment in Estonia.

Pharmaceutical products' reimbursement dossiers submission and decisions are dealt with on the state level. Health technology assessment analyses are required by the authorities and the Baltic Guidelines for Economic Evaluations of Pharmaceuticals have to be followed.

"As the search for effective cost-containment policies continues, health care reform along pro-competition lines has gained considerable backing in the United States. By offering market competition to achieve allocational efficiency and vouchers and tax credits to achieve distributional equity, pro-competition reforms appear to satisfy what many believed were incommensurable goals. A critical review of this strategy reveals two practical difficulties, however. The first concerns the ambiguity arising from the proposals' reliance on the concept of equal access to some basic level of health care as its distributional objective and the second concerns the ethical dilemma arising from the proposals' reliance on physicians as rationers of health care. In considering the distributional goal of guaranteeing access to a basic minimum of health care, we argue that, despite its theoretical attractiveness, there exists no acceptable way of determining or justifying its content, and without a clear definition of the basic minimum there is no guarantee that any equity objective will be achieved under the pro-competition strategy. With regard to the use of physicians and other providers as society's gatekeepers, we point out that this role is in direct conflict with traditional responsibilities that patients expect providers to assume. Requiring doctors to ration services in response to market incentives may further erode the trust relationship between physicians and patients, and clearly puts the more seriously ill at a disadvantage.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(85)90201-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4059946/,economics

This research introduces quantitative, stochastic CBA frameworks and applies them in case studies of flood and drought risk reduction in India and Pakistan, while also incorporating projected climate change impacts. DRM interventions are shown to be economically efficient, with integrated approaches more cost-effective and robust than singular interventions. The paper highlights that CBA can be a useful tool if certain issues are considered properly, including: complexities in estimating risk; data dependency of results; negative effects of interventions; and distributional aspects. The design and process of CBA must take into account specific objectives, available information, resources, and the perceptions and needs of stakeholders as transparently as possible.

"Obesity is an economic problem. Bariatric surgery is cost-effective for severe and resistant obesity. Most economic evaluations of bariatric surgery use administrative data and narrowly defined direct medical costs in their quantitative analyses. Demand far outstrips supply for bariatric surgery. Further allocation of health care resources to bariatric surgery (particularly public) could be stimulated by new health economic evidence that supports the provision of bariatric surgery. We postulated that qualitative research methods would elicit important health economic dimensions of bariatric surgery that would typically be omitted from the current economic evaluation framework, nor be reported and therefore not considered by policymakers with sufficient priority. We listened to patients: Focus group data were analysed thematically with software assistance. Key themes were identified inductively through a dialogue between the qualitative data and pre-existing economic theory (perspective, externalities, and emotional capital). We identified the concept of emotional capital where participants described life-changing desires to be productive and participate in their communities postoperatively. After self-funding bariatric surgery, some participants experienced financial distress. We recommend a mixed-methods approach to the economic evaluation of bariatric surgery. This could be operationalised in health economic model conceptualisation and construction, through to the separate reporting of qualitative results to supplement quantitative results.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29855095/,economics
"Canada recently entered into two multinational trade agreements (i.e., the Canada, United States, and Mexico Trade Agreement; and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union). The resulting federal policy changes will prolong periods of market protection afforded to eligible brand-name prescription drugs by extending competition-blocking patent and data exclusivity terms. While previous studies have analysed these two policy changes in isolation, it remains unknown what the total combined impact will be in a typical year. Our objective was to design an analytic approach that can assess more than one change to a country's market protections and then to apply this methodology to the Canadian context. We find that the collective impact of these policy changes will be to extend the regulatory protection period for new drugs from an average of 10.0 years to 11.1 years. Depending upon the model's assumptions and all contingencies considered, an 11% increase equated to an average of $410 million annually (with a minimum estimate of $40 million and a maximum of $1.4 billion). Despite this uncertainty reflected in the range of possible financial impacts, we conclude that such methodological approaches could be useful for rapidly evaluating potential policy changes prior to adoption, which may further assist in budget planning to mitigate increased cost to the downstream health authorities most impacted by these trade concessions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.09.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31601457/,economics
"Casemix funding was introduced first in Victoria in 1993-94, and since then most States have moved towards either casemix funding or using casemix to inform the budget setting process. The five States implementing casemix have adopted some common funding elements: all use AN-DRG-3; all have introduced capping, msot commonly at the hospital level; and all ensure accuracy of diagnosis and procedure coding through coding audits. Two funding models have been developed. The fixed and variable model involves a fixed grant for hospital overhead costs and a payment for each patient treated, covering only variable costs. The integrated model provides an integrated payment to hospitals for each patient treated, covering both the fixed and variable costs. There are different weight setting processes and base prices between the States, which result in marked differences in the price paid for the same type of case treated in similar hospitals. Learning across State boundaries should be encouraged, with knowledge of what is effective and what is ineffective in casemix funding arrangements being used to develop Australian best practice in this area.",https://doi.org/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1998.tb123470.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9830405/,economics

"In this article, I argue that unregulated markets will not find the right level of health care quality but that at the same time it is not clear that single-payer systems will do any better. My perspective combines the economic theory of public goods and the institutional payment arrangements found in many single-payer systems. If, as I believe, health care quality is a public good, it will be underprovided in a multipayer system. Single-payer systems often allocate a fixed budget to health care professionals or administrators and give them considerable discretion in determining quality as well as quantity of service. With care being free or almost free at the point of use, patients will demand more services than administrators want to provide. The result is rationing by waiting -- which should be present in all such systems and is present in most of them. I develop several implications of the theory and an agenda for future research on quality of care in single-payer and multipayer health systems.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2009-019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19633227/,economics
"Over the last decades, methods for the economic evaluation of health care technologies were increasingly used to inform reimbursement decisions. For a short time, the German Statutory Health Insurance makes use of these methods to support reimbursement decisions on patented drugs. In this context, the discounting procedure emerges as a critical component of these methods, as discount rates can strongly affect the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The aim of this paper is to identify the appropriate value of a social discount rate to be used by the German Statutory Health Insurance for the economic evaluation of health technologies. On theoretical grounds, we build on the widespread view of contemporary economists that the social rate of time preference (SRTP) is the adequate social discount rate. For quantifying the SRTP, we first apply the market behaviour approach, which assumes that the SRTP is reflected in observable market interest rates. As a second approach, we derive the SRTP from optimal growth theory by using the Ramsey equation. A major part of the paper is devoted to specify the parameters of this equation. Depending on various assumptions, our empirical findings result in the range of 1.75-4.2% for the SRTP. A reasonable base case discount rate for Germany, thus, would be about 3%. Furthermore, we deal with the much debated question whether a common discount rate for costs and health benefits or a lower rate for health should be applied in health economic evaluations. In the German social health insurance system, no exogenously fixed budget constraint does exist. When evaluating a new health technology, the health care decision maker is obliged to conduct an economic evaluation in order to examine whether there is an economically appropriate relation between the value of the health gains and the additional costs which are given by the value of the consumption losses due to the additional health care expenditures. Therefore, a discount rate lower than the SRTP for consumption should be applied if an increase in the consumption value of health is expected. However, given the limited empirical evidence on the relationship between consumption and the value of health, it is hardly possible to make reliable forecasts of this value. Regarding the practice of the German evaluation authority, it is not recommended to use differential discounting in the base case. Instead, the issue of differential discounting should be addressed in sensitivity analyses. Reducing the discount rate for health compared to the rate for costs by a figure in the range between near 0% and 3% may be considered to be appropriate for Germany.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-010-0292-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21170731/,economics
"Economic sociologists have argued that financial markets should be analysed as uncertainty-processing social networks and intermediary groups. Networks and intermediaries alone cannot confer legitimacy upon financial actors and transactions. Status groups are a solution to this problem. They emphasize reputation, honour and good social behaviour as stabilizers of collective action, as means of social control and as indicators of legitimacy. I examine here the emergence and evolution of status groups of brokers in London, New York and Paris, and show how emphasis on honour was used to legitimize financial transactions. I argue that financial markets should be conceived as networks, intermediary and status groups. In global, automated financial markets status groups like securities analysts are gaining in prominence.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00077.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16156758/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      This systematic review of economic evaluations of universal preventative or targeted treatment parenting interventions that aim to enhance parent-infant interaction is primarily intended to inform decision makers who have to make difficult spending decisions, especially at a time of reduced spending allocations. A synthesis of available costs and savings about parenting interventions that set out to enhance parent-infant interaction is presented. This topic is important specifically in view of the UK Governments' emphasis on the equalities agenda and the early years. The benefits of positive early life experiences, which include good parent-infant interaction, are far reaching and may be positively correlated with improved educational, health and well-being outcomes and reduced criminality.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was undertaken using on-line indexing databases between 2004 and 2014 that included the search terms 'parent', 'infant', 'interaction', 'cost benefit analysis' and their synonyms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Despite existing economic studies generally focusing upon targeted short-run outcomes, significant savings were observed in the included studies. Parenting interventions could save the health service around £2.5k per family over 25 years and could save the criminal justice system over £145k per person over the life course. In light of the escalating costs of remedial services, these potential savings may provide the UK and other governments with a robust incentive to invest in early years parenting interventions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Parenting interventions can be economically efficient and return savings on investment. Moreover, and one might argue as a moral imperative of democratic societies, population health can be improved and health inequalities reduced. An important debate is needed about early years policy, to include acknowledgement of the differences between UK and international healthcare systems and the potential savings from the synergistic and spin-off effects of early years interventions to inform decision-making to fund and implement appropriate action.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28557011/,economics
"Backgound:
        
      
      The Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) has been the subject of controversy since its inception, with critics arguing that it creates a ""backdoor"" to the National Health Service (NHS), circumventing the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and its health technology assessment program. Nonetheless, with its creation comes a new decision problem, how to best allocate resources among cancer drugs.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      Our objective was to estimate CDF's willingness and ability to pay for cancer drugs, providing guidance regarding where CDF funds are best spent, and determining the number of NHS quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) displaced through the existence of the fund.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using CDF utilization figures, cost-per-QALY, and treatment episode costs from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence health technology assessment reports, the league-table approach was applied to determine appropriate cost-effectiveness thresholds to inform the CDF's decision making.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The CDF exhibits a willingness-to-pay value of £223,627 per QALY, with 74% and 33% of expenditure for drugs with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of more than £50,000 and more than £90,000, respectively. During 2013-2014, CDF expenditure generated 4,677 QALYs, compared with a potential 13,485 if the same funds were used as part of routine NHS commissioning, displacing 8,808 QALYs. By ring fencing 10%, 25%, and 50% of the CDF budget for the provision of unevaluated drugs, cost-effectiveness thresholds of £149,000, £111,400, and £68,600 were calculated, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Adopting the proposed framework for CDF prioritization would result in disinvestment from a number of highly cost-ineffective drugs applicable for CDF reimbursement. The present lack of a formal economic evaluation not only results in net health losses but also compromises a founding principle of the NHS, that of ""equal access for equal need.""",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27565274/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between the financial impact of a new drug and the recommendation for reimbursement by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data in the PBAC summary database were abstracted for decisions made between July 2005 and November 2009. Financial impact-the upper bound of the values presented in the PBAC summary database-was categorized as ≤A$0, >A$0 up to A$10 million, A$10 million up to A$30 million, and >A$30 million per year. Descriptive, logistic, survival, and recursive partitioning decision analyses were used to estimate the relationship between the financial impact of a new drug indication and the recommendation for reimbursement. Multivariable analyses controlled for other clinical and economic variables, including cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Financial impact was a significant predictor of the recommendation for reimbursement. In the logistic analysis, the odds ratios of reimbursement for drug submissions with financial impacts ≥A$10 million to ≥A$30 million or >A$0 to <A$10 million compared with ≤A$0 were 0.12 (95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.51) and 0.16 (95 percent CI: 0.04-0.60), respectively. In the recursive partition decision analysis, the first split of the data was for submissions with a positive financial impact compared with those with a zero or negative financial impact.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In Australia, financial impact on the drug budget is an important determinant of whether a new drug is recommended for reimbursement when cost-effectiveness estimates and other clinical and economic variables are controlled.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462312000724,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23217275/,economics
"Economic evaluations are a set of outcomes and health services research methods to inform the debate about the rising cost of health care and include cost-of-illness studies and cost-effectiveness research. Cost-effectiveness research is the comparative analysis of two or more alternative interventions in terms of their health and economic consequences, whose results are expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, the ratio of differences in cost between a pair of medical interventions to the differences in the corresponding health effects. These research methods are particularly important to neurological diseases with debilitating natural histories, long-term courses, and a growing number of exciting, yet costly, treatment options available. The results of economic evaluations of neurological conditions influence resource allocation decisions, help set reimbursement rates, estimate future healthcare expenses, and improve the quality and efficiency of delivering neurological care. For these research methods to achieve their potential, continued methodological advances within the field are needed, as well as a more systematic integration of these methods into mainstream research to address critical questions regarding the health and well-being of patients with neurological illness.",https://doi.org/10.1602/neurorx.1.3.348,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15717037/,economics
"This study examines the association between health expenditures, economic growth (EG) and environmental pollution in Asia both at panel and country level. The separate impact of EG and environmental pollution on public and private health expenditures (PRHEs) are also examined. In doing so the panel cointegration tests with the level break, common correlated effects mean group and heterogeneous panel causality test are employed. The study covers 20 Asian economies and time-period from 1995 to 2017. The results provide evidence in support of a long run association between selected variables. The results explain that EG and environmental pollution are positively associated with total health expenditures as well as with public and PRHEs in all countries. However, the magnitude of environmental pollution coefficient is greater from EG coefficient, thus indicate that environmental pollution is the key determinant in increasing national health expenditures. Causality results demonstrate the existence of two-way causality between health expenditures and EG and unidirectional causality flowing from environmental pollution to health expenditures in Asian economies. Findings of this study have provided some important suggestions to policy makers which can be used to minimize the risk of environmental pollution on health in Asian economies.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3132,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33709526/,economics
"Goals of work:
        
      
      Economic and regulatory healthcare policy is limited by the lack of population-based information on the cost of supportive care of cancer patients. The goal of this study was to estimate these costs and to explore the impact of these costs on policy decisions.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We identified estimates of the cost of outpatient and inpatient supportive care from published reports in the literature. The range of these costs (from lowest to highest) is described for each supportive care condition. These estimates were supplemented by computing the cost of all hospitalizations for these conditions in Texas between June 2000 and December 2001. Medicare payments were used to estimate average reimbursement. Costs (not charges) were standardized to 2002 US dollars using the consumer price index for medical care and Medicare's cost-to-charge ratio for Texas.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      Inpatient care for most conditions exceeded 7,000 US dollars per episode. Our population-based estimates of the cost of care were similar to literature-based estimates, except in the case where conditions could be managed in the outpatient setting. Average Medicare payments were often far lower than the estimated cost of care. For example, the estimated cost of hospitalization for management of diarrhea was 6,616 US dollars while the average Medicare payment was only 2,809 US dollars.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Many supportive care interventions are quite expensive. In an environment focused on cost containment, a risk-based approach to expensive supportive care treatments is essential. Further study of the cost effectiveness of supportive care management strategies is indicated.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-003-0513-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14767748/,economics

"It is a well acknowledged fact that steep increases in health expenditures are mainly due to improvements in health technologies as well as the ageing of population combined with mounting societal preferences towards health. This ""natural"" tendency increasingly faces constraints of public budgets. Therefore, both efficiency and effectiveness considerations have to be put in place in order to allocate financial resources in such a way as to foster optimal results. This can best be done by implementing the analytical tool of health economic evaluations. However, in the Austrian context health economic evaluations only play a minor role as yet. The major hindrance for this unsatisfactory situation is the complex system of health finance which impedes overall considerations beyond the array of particular budgets.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10354-006-0359-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17211767/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      To describe empirical studies evaluating the impact of reference pricing (RP) interventions in pharmaceutical markets in order to discuss the requirements for these evaluations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ten studies were included in this review. For each study, the nature of the intervention, the nature of the data available, the nature of the question to be answered and the requirements of the evaluation method were examined through a questionnaire. The most frequently used evaluation method was the conventional before-after estimator, and only three studies used the difference-in-differences method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine studies evaluated a therapeutic RP system and one evaluated a generic RP system. All of the papers reported how the reference price level was established, but only one study directly reported the updating frequency and criteria of the RP system. In four studies, details of simultaneous interventions were not reported. There is no paper providing evidence on overall social welfare impact. Four papers estimated the impact of intervention on the consumer price of drugs covered by the RP system. Only one provided information about the impact on the price of related drugs not covered by the system. Three studies included an outcome variable for the use of health services. The impact of RP intervention on the level of competition in the market for those medicines covered by the system was reported in only three of ten papers.

"The present paper provides first empirical evidence on the relationship between market size and the number of firms in the healthcare industry for a transition economy. We estimate market-size thresholds required to support different numbers of suppliers (firms) for three occupations in the healthcare industry in a large number of distinct geographic markets in Slovakia, taking into account the spatial interaction between local markets. The empirical analysis is carried out for three time periods (1995, 2001 and 2010) which characterise different stages of the transition process. Our results suggest that the relationship between market size and the number of firms differs both across industries and across periods. In particular, we find that pharmacies, as the only completely liberalised market in our dataset, experience the largest change in competitive behaviour during the transition process. Furthermore, we find evidence for correlation in entry decisions across administrative borders, suggesting that future market analysis should aim to capture these regional effects.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-018-0959-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29445942/,economics
"This paper challenges traditional views which oppose health economics and medical ethics by arguing that economic assessment is a necessary complement to medical ethics and can help to improve public participation and democratic processes in choices about resource allocation for health care technologies. In support of this argument, four points are emphasized: (1) Most current biomedical ethical debates implicitly deal with economic issues of resource allocation. (2) Clinical decisions, which usually respect the Hippocratic code of ethics, are nevertheless influenced by economic incentives and constraints. (3) Economic assessment is concerned with both efficiency and equity and potential trade-offs between the two, which means that ethical judgements are always embedded in welfare economics. (4) The real debate is not between economics on the one side and medical ethics on the other. Rather it is between different ethical conceptions of social justice and the contrasting approaches they entail to reconciling individual interests and preferences with collective goods and welfare.",https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1009437104347,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15968969/,economics
"Health economic models have become the primary vehicle for undertaking economic evaluation and are used in various healthcare jurisdictions across the world to inform decisions about the use of new and existing health technologies. Models are required because a single source of evidence, such as a randomised controlled trial, is rarely sufficient to provide all relevant information about the expected costs and health consequences of all competing decision alternatives. Whilst models are used to synthesise all relevant evidence, they also contain assumptions, abstractions and simplifications. By their very nature, all models are therefore 'wrong'. As such, the interpretation of estimates of the cost effectiveness of health technologies requires careful judgements about the degree of confidence that can be placed in the models from which they are drawn. The presence of a single error or inappropriate judgement within a model may lead to inappropriate decisions, an inefficient allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately suboptimal outcomes for patients. This paper sets out a taxonomy of threats to the credibility of health economic models. The taxonomy segregates threats to model credibility into three broad categories: (i) unequivocal errors, (ii) violations, and (iii) matters of judgement; and maps these across the main elements of the model development process. These three categories are defined according to the existence of criteria for judging correctness, the degree of force with which such criteria can be applied, and the means by which these credibility threats can be handled. A range of suggested processes and techniques for avoiding and identifying these threats is put forward with the intention of prospectively improving the credibility of models.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0186-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25027943/,economics
"Corporate employers have become major purchasers of health care. They are gatekeepers who decide whether to retain or drop an insurance company from the choice set offered to employees as well as whether to include new insurers into this choice set. If marketers of health maintenance organizations are to maintain their market share in this competitive environment, they need to understand issues considered important to corporate employers. This paper identifies the key drivers of satisfaction among corporate employers and shows the impact these key drivers have on overall satisfaction. More importantly, it demonstrates both theoretically and empirically that the impact of performance attributes on satisfaction is asymmetrical. Positive performances of attributes are shown to have smaller impacts on satisfaction than negative performances. The theoretical underpinnings of these phenomena are shown to lie in prospect theory. Finally, quantitative indicators are computed to aid managerial decision-making. Marketing managers of health insurance companies will optimize returns on their investment by understanding this asymmetric effect and eliminate existing deficiencies.",https://doi.org/10.1300/j026v17n04_03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11183659/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Snakebite envenoming, a high priority Neglected Tropical Disease categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been considered as a poverty-related disease that requires greater global awareness and collaboration to establish strategies that effectively decrease economic burdens. This prompts the need for a comprehensive review of the global literature that summarizes the global economic burden and a description of methodology details and their variation. This study aimed to systematically identify studies on cost of illness and economic evaluation associated with snakebites, summarize study findings, and evaluate their methods to provide recommendations for future studies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Econlit for articles published from inception to 31 July 2019. Original articles reporting costs or full economic evaluation related with snakebites were included. The methods and reporting quality were assessed. Costs were presented in US dollars (US$) in 2018.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-three cost of illness studies and three economic evaluation studies related to snakebites were included. Majority of studies (18/23, 78.26%) were conducted in Low- and Middle-income countries. Most cost of illness studies (82.61%) were done using hospital-based data of snakebite patients. While, four studies (17.39%) estimated costs of snakebites in communities. Five studies (21.74%) used societal perspective estimating both direct and indirect costs. Only one study (4.35%) undertook incidence-based approach to estimate lifetime costs. Only three studies (13.04%) estimated annual national economic burdens of snakebite which varied drastically from US$126 319 in Burkina Faso to US$13 802 550 in Sri Lanka. Quality of the cost of illness studies were varied and substantially under-reported. All three economic evaluation studies were cost-effectiveness analysis using decision tree model. Two of them assessed cost-effectiveness of having full access to antivenom and reported cost-effective findings.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economic burdens of snakebite were underestimated and not extensively studied. To accurately capture the economic burdens of snakebites at both the global and local level, hospital data should be collected along with community survey and economic burdens of snakebites should be estimated both in short-term and long-term period to incorporate the lifetime costs and productivity loss due to premature death, disability, and consequences of snakebites.",https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.020415,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33312499/,economics

"The pharmacoeconomics of antipsychotic therapy is discussed. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness that develops early in life and has a long-term impact on the health care system, including costs. Treatment goals therefore include a reduction in the rate of rehospitalization, a primary source of the health care costs related to this disease. Atypical antipsychotics are often associated with improved efficacy and better tolerability than the older, conventional antipsychotic agents, and their use in schizophrenia has increased. However, the atypical drugs have higher acquisition costs that may limit their use in the cost-influenced health care environment. These acquisition costs vary widely among drugs and are often dependent on dosage. Analysis of the use of atypical antipsychotics in the Veterans Affairs Health System and other health systems demonstrates that, despite their higher acquisition costs, significant health and economic benefits can be obtained compared with conventional agents. Given the approximately equivalent efficacy demonstrated thus far by atypical antipsychotics, an appropriate cost-reduction strategy may include using the agent with the lowest acquisition cost.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/59.suppl_8.s5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12455293/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Growing public and private expenditure on healthcare results i.a. from the spreading of chronic diseases. Diabetes belongs to the most frequent ones, beyond neoplasms and cardiological diseases, and hence generates a significant burden for the public finance in terms of the direct costs. However, the economy suffers also from the indirect cost of diabetes that manifests itself in the loss in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and general government revenues.

      This paper aims to measure this indirect cost, both in terms of GDP drop (social perspective) and public revenue drop (public finance perspective), in the case of Poland in 2012-2014. We use a modified human capital approach and unique dataset provided by the Social Security institution in Poland and the Polish Central Statistical Office.

"Background and purpose:
        
      
      The introduction of DRGs in Germany in 2003 enabled the establishment of a compensation system, which combines quality of services and economic viability. This new system leads to an increase in competition among clinics and insurance providers to act as economic as possible. Various options exist for individual hospitals to increase economic viability; these actions, however, need to be identified, categorized and prioritized to enable hospitals to act accordingly. The goal of this analysis is to identify possible actions hospitals can take as a result of the introduction of G-DRGs.
    


          Method:
        
      
      These actions will be divided into strategic and organizational-operational actions, which have a direct implication on the DRG system or conterminal areas. The strategic actions should provide a first step toward developing a comprehensive system under which individual hospitals can determine the best set of actions to reach their respective goals. The organizational-operative dimension then focuses on the concrete individual actions a hospital can take to reach that goal. RESULTS UND CONCLUSION: As a result, this analysis reveals that hospitals should increasingly attempt to find additional sources of income outside the closed-ended sectoral budgets of the public health insurance sector in Germany. Further, hospitals should increasingly focus on optimizing their cost structure according to standard optimization approaches to increase their ability to provide quality services at competitive costs. Finding the right size for each hospital under the new DRG incentivation and compensation structure has become one of the most critical strategic questions each hospital has to answer individually.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00063-005-1117-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15654540/,economics
"Health technology assessment provides a common framework for evaluating the costs and benefits of new health technologies to inform decisions on the public funding of new pharmaceuticals and other health technologies. In Australia and England, empirical analyses of the opportunity costs of government spending on new health technologies suggest more quality adjusted life years are being forgone than are being gained by a non-trivial proportion of funded health technologies. This essay considers the relevance of available empirical estimates of opportunity costs and explores the relationship between the public funding of health technologies and broader political and economic factors. We conclude that the benefits of a general reduction in the prices paid by governments for new technologies outweigh the costs, but evidence of informed public acceptance of reduced access to new health technologies may be required to shift the current approach to assessing the value of new health technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1355819617751816,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29320891/,economics
"In Europe, the vast majority of the costs of cancer therapy fall on third-party payers, normally the government, or sickness funds. Therefore, the main focus of cost-effectiveness studies is to assist payers in deciding whether new therapies are worthwhile, despite their high cost. Drug budgets are regulated in most European countries. The main form of central control is price setting, with some form of reference pricing being the most common approach. This sets the price of drugs, either to an international standard, or to a common price for drugs in the same group or cluster. At the hospital level, the main control over cancer drugs is the hospital formulary. Studies have shown a wide variation among European countries in access to cancer drugs. Explanations for these variations include differences in research funding, the drug approval process, the role of health economics in decision making, and budgetary issues. Several countries in Europe now require economic data in making decisions about the reimbursement of new drugs. An examination of decisions made by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom suggests that cancer drugs have fared quite well, with most recommendations being positive. This could be because of the seriousness of the health condition and the lack of alternative therapies for some cancer patients. If the policy of requesting cost-effectiveness evidence for pricing and reimbursement decisions becomes more popular, a major implication for the pharmaceutical industry is that studies should be conducted during phase III of clinical development to generate the required data.",https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2006.07.8956,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17210939/,economics

"What kind of a thing is science and how does it work? [Kealey T. Sex, science and profits: In a recent book (Sex, science and profits: how people evolved to make money. London: William Heinemann; 2008) (p. 455)] Terence Kealey argues persuasively that the motivations driving science are widely misunderstood. Science is often assumed to be useful to the public but an economic loser for the scientist and his or her paymasters - in other words, science is supposed to be a 'public good'. The public good argument is used to support large-scale government funding of science, on the basis that if government does not fund science it will not be funded adequately. But Kealey argues that most science is profitable to commercial organizations, and other types of worthwhile science will be supported by private patronage. Yet excessive government funding tends to 'crowd-out' potential private sources of funding - both by replacing and by deterring private investment. And scientists are not primarily motivated by money, but instead by striving for status within the 'invisible college' of active researchers in their field. Kealey's take-home message is that overall and in the long-term, science neither requires nor benefits from government funding. Scientific research would be better-served by private funding from commercial organizations that are seeking profit, combined with patronage from charities and foundations that regard science as intrinsically valuable.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2008.09.025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18977606/,economics
"Almost all states have enacted legislation, that allows pharmacists to substitute drug products when filling prescriptions. We studied the effects of competition in the drugstore service area on the use of less costly drug products and the pricing of prescriptions under the drug-product-selection law in Minnesota. In 38 drugstores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, rates of substitution of generic or less-costly brands and prescription prices were analyzed according to the degree of competition in the drugstore's service area, as measured by the pharmacists' perceptions and the number of competing drugstores within a 1-mile radius. Although higher levels of competition were associated with increased use of generic drugs for prescriptions written generically, competition did not appear to affect either dispensing patterns for prescriptions written for brand-name products or the retail prices of brand-name or generic products. These findings do not support the hypothesis that competition reduces prescription-drug prices through improved selection of drug products at the retail pharmacy level.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198307283090404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6866035/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      This article reports the results of the application of conjoint analysis (CA) to derive a monetary value of informal care. Compared with normally recommended valuation methods such as the opportunity cost method and proxy good method, a valuation elicited through a CA might be more sensitive to the heterogeneity and dynamics of informal care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We developed a questionnaire and conducted a survey in which informal caregivers were asked to rate four different hypothetical informal caregiving situations (reflecting different combinations of care hours, care tasks, and monetary compensation). They were also asked to rate their current informal care situation compared with the four hypothetical situations. Data were obtained from postal questionnaires. These questionnaires were sent through regional support centres for informal caregivers of care recipients with various health problems. A total of 865 informal caregivers from this heterogeneous population returned a completed survey.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Informal caregivers require an increase of 81% in their hourly compensation for providing 21 instead of 7 hours informal care per week. This implies a compensation of Euro 12.36 per hour at a mean hypothetical compensation in the presented scenarios. We also found that an informal caregiver's current caregiving situation and other background characteristics were associated with the scenario ratings.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We conclude that a CA is a promising alternative for existing methods to determine a monetary value of informal care and encourage more experiments in this area.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00357.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18489514/,economics
"The current economic crisis and food price increase may have a widespread impact on the nutritional and health status of populations, especially in the developing world. Gains in child survival over the past few decades are likely to be threatened and millennium development goals will be harder to achieve. Beyond starvation, which is one of the causes of death in famine situations, there are numerous nutritional pathways by which childhood mortality can increase. These include increases in childhood wasting and stunting, intrauterine growth restriction, and micronutrient deficiencies such as that of vitamin A, iron, and zinc when faced with a food crisis and decreased food availability. These pathways are elucidated and described. Although estimates of the impact of the current crisis on child mortality are yet to be made, data from previous economic crises provide evidence of an increase in childhood mortality that we review. The current situation also emphasizes that there are vast segments of the world's population living in a situation of chronic food insecurity that are likely to be disproportionately affected by an economic crisis. Nutritional and health surveillance data are urgently needed in such populations to monitor both the impacts of a crisis and of interventions. Addressing the nutritional needs of children and women in response to the present crisis is urgent. But, ensuring that vulnerable populations are also targeted with known nutritional interventions at all times is likely to have a substantial impact on child mortality.",https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.111708,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19923384/,economics
"Behavioral economic measures have demonstrated marked success in the evaluation of consumer choice. Field-standard operant demand curve analyses provide a valuable model of resource allocation via responses to maintain ""free-rate"" commodity use or consumption. This demand analysis thereby provides a behavioral complement to consumer science techniques. Despite apparent congruence of operant behavioral economics and consumer science, the left-digit effect represents one area of research predominantly untouched by behavioral economic investigation. Previous efforts have applied the hypothetical purchase task to map the effect of a changing left-digit on subsequent purchase decisions. The current study extends investigation of the phenomenon to responding on the validated Alcohol Purchase Task. Introduction of a high-density price structure revealed evidence of digit sensitivity, wherein demand elasticity was disproportionately affected at and around whole-dollar changes. That responses were influenced by small shifts in pricing implies a possibility for policy-level modulation of alcohol ingestion without need to increase commodity price beyond unit elasticity. Capture of digit preference in a self-report framework speaks to the sensitivity of purchase task methodology to detect small, aberrant changes in consumer product perception. Behavioral economic researchers should consider this extent of sensitivity when interpreting results of hypothetical purchase task investigations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.05.020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31121215/,economics
"Global health spending share of low/middle income countries continues its long-term growth. BRICS nations remain to be major drivers of such change since 1990s. Governmental, private and out-of-pocket health expenditures were analyzed based on WHO sources. Medium-term projections of national health spending to 2025 were provided based on macroeconomic budgetary excess growth model. In terms of per capita spending Russia was highest in 2013. India's health expenditure did not match overall economic growth and fell to slightly less than 4% of GDP. Up to 2025 China will achieve highest excess growth rate of 2% and increase its GDP% spent on health care from 5.4% in 2012 to 6.6% in 2025. Russia's spending will remain highest among BRICS in absolute per capita terms reaching net gain from $1523 PPP in 2012 to $2214 PPP in 2025. In spite of BRICS' diversity, all countries were able to significantly increase their investments in health care. The major setback was bold rise in out-of-pocket spending. Most of BRICS' growing share of global medical spending was heavily attributable to the overachievement of People's Republic of China. Such trend is highly likely to continue beyond 2025.

"Current control practices against gastrointestinal nematodes in dairy cows rely strongly on anthelmintic use. To reduce the development of anthelmintic resistance or disposition of drug residues in the environment, novel control approaches are currently proposed that target anthelmintic treatment to individual animals instead of the whole herd. However, such selective treatment strategies come with additional costs for labor and diagnostics and, so far, no studies have addressed whether they could be economically sustainable. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the economic effects at farm level of whole-herd versus more selective anthelmintic treatment strategies in adult dairy cows, and (2) determine how these economic effects depend on level of infection and herd size. A Monte Carlo simulation, fed by current epidemiological and economical knowledge, was used to estimate the expected economic effects and possible variation of different control strategies under Belgian conditions. Four treatment strategies were compared with a baseline situation in which no treatments were applied: whole herd at calving (S1), selective at calving with (S2) or without (S3) treatment of the first-calf cows, and whole-herd when animals are moved from grazing to the barn in the fall (housing treatment, S4). The benefit per lactation for an average dairy herd varied between -$2 and $131 (average $64) for S1, between -$2 and $127 (average $62) for S2, between -$17 and $104 (average $43) for S3, and between -$41 and $72 (average $15) for S4. The farmer's risk associated with any treatment strategy, as indicated by the width of the 95% credible intervals of economic benefit of anthelmintic treatment, decreased with increasing level of exposure, as assessed by bulk tank milk ELISA. The order of the different strategies when sorted by expected benefit was robust to changes in economic input parameters. We conclude that, on average, strategies applying anthelmintic treatment at calving outperform a strategy applying treatment at housing. Within the strategies that applied treatment at calving, more selective treatment strategies can be economically sustainable. However, given the large variation in possible benefits within each treatment strategy, decision support systems are needed to account for the multitude of cow, epidemiological, and economic factors that determine the economics of nematode control and select the optimal treatment strategy for a specific farm.",https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-4719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22612935/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The financial crisis that hit the global economy in 2007 was unprecedented in the post war era. In general the crisis has created a difficult environment for health systems globally. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for assessing the resilience of health systems in terms of how they have adjusted to economic crisis. Resilience can be understood as the capacity of a system to absorb change but continue to retain essentially the same identity and function. The Irish health system is used as a case study to assess the usefulness of this framework.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The authors identify three forms of resilience: financial, adaptive and transformatory. Indicators of performance are presented to allow for testing of the framework and measurement of system performance. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to yield data for the Irish case study. Quantitative data were collected from government documents and sources to understand the depth of the recession and the different dimensions of the response. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key decision makers to understand the reasons for decisions made.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the Irish case there is mixed evidence on resilience. Health funding was initially protected but was then followed by deep cuts as the crisis deepened. There is strong evidence for adaptive resilience, with the health system showing efficiency gains from the recession. Nevertheless, easy efficiencies have been made and continued austerity will mean cuts in entitlements and services. The prospects for building and maintaining transformatory resilience are unsure. While the direction of reform is clear, and has been preserved to date, it is not certain whether it will remain manageable given continued austerity, some loss of sovereignty and capacity limitations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The three aspects of resilience proved a useful categorisation of performance measurement though there is overlap between them. Transformatory resilience may be more difficult to assess precisely. It would be useful to test out the framework against other country experiences and refine the measures and indicators. Further research on both the comparative resilience of different health systems and building resilience in preparation for crises is encouraged.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-13-450,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24171814/,economics
"This paper argues that increasing resistance to antimicrobials is an important social externality that has not been captured at the level of economic appraisal. The paper explicitly considers reasons why the externality of antimicrobial resistance has not generally been included as a cost in economic evaluations comparing management strategies for infectious diseases. Four reasons are considered: first, that the absolute cost of antimicrobial resistance is too small to be worth including; second, that there is an implicit discounting of the costs of antimicrobial resistance on the basis of time preference which makes the cost too small to be worth including; third, that there is an implicit discounting of the costs of antimicrobial resistance on the basis of uncertainty which makes the cost too small to be worth including; and fourth, that the costs are too difficult to measure. Although there does not appear to be methodological justification for excluding the costs of antimicrobial resistance, it seems likely that, because of the practical difficulties associated with measuring these costs, they will continue to be ignored. The paper concludes with a discussion of the applicability of standard policy responses used to deal with externalities in other areas of welfare economics.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199605)5:3<217::aid-hec200>3.0.co;2-s,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8817296/,economics
"The financing system for medical costs in this country suffers from severe inflation and inequity. The tax-supported system of fee for service for doctors, third-party intermediaries and cost reimbursement for hospitals produces inflation by rewarding cost-increasing behavior and failing to provide incentives for economy. The system is inequitable because the government pays more on behalf of those who choose more costly systems of care, because tax benefits subsidize the health insurance of the well-to-do, while not helping many low-income people, and because employment health insurance does not guarantee continuity of coverage and is regressive in its financing. Analysis of previous proposals for national health insurance shows none to be capable of solving most of these problems. Direct economic regulation by government will not improve the situation.

"Objectives:
        
      
      In Japan, a new cost-effectiveness evaluation system for medicine and medical device pricing was employed in April 2019 after a trial implementation. This study describes the discussions held from April 2016 to March 2019 concerning the newly introduced system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using published government documents, discussions with stakeholders, and the minutes of the Chuikyo committee meetings, the following issues are addressed: (i) the results of the trial implementation and (ii) an overview of the newly introduced system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During the trial implementation, thirteen products were evaluated and their prices adjusted. The process of the new system-which was to be implemented in FY 2019-takes about 15-18 months to complete after listing of the target products by the National Health Insurance. The target products are selected principally based on sales volume, degree of innovation (premium), and disclosure of rationale for price setting. First, a manufacturer submits the cost-effectiveness data, which is then reviewed by the Center for Outcomes Research and Economic Evaluation for Health (C2H) in collaboration with academics. The results of the cost-effectiveness evaluation are not considered during the decision-making process concerning the product's listing. The price adjustment system is similar to value-based pricing (VBP); hence, the new system can be considered as VBP adjustment.
    


          Conclusion:

The first section gives a description of some quite recent proposals to extend the role of the pricing and insurance mechanisms which have been made by the British Medical Association and the McKinsey consultancy company. The second section uses economic analysis to show that both the pricing and the insurance mechanisms have inherent problems which may vitiate their efficiency in many western health care markets.

"Background:
        
      
      Informal care makes an important contribution to societal welfare. However, it may involve substantial time costs and can have a considerable negative effect on the health and well-being of informal caregivers. These costs and effects of informal caregiving are often excluded in economic evaluations of healthcare interventions. The impact of this exclusion on the outcomes of these evaluations is largely unknown.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to explore the inclusion of informal care in economic evaluations and the potential impact of the costs and effects of informal caregiving on cost-effectiveness outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of interventions in four distinct disease areas where informal care is potentially important: Alzheimer's disease, metastatic colorectal cancer, Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It was recorded how often economic evaluations included informal caregiving. Next, for the studies including informal care, the impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes was determined by removing informal care costs and effects of the cost-effectiveness calculations and recalculating the outcomes. The new cost-effectiveness outcomes were then compared with the original reported outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study identified 100 economic evaluations investigating interventions targeted at Alzheimer's disease (n = 25), metastatic colorectal cancer (n = 24), Parkinson's disease (n = 8) and rheumatoid arthritis (n = 43). Twenty-three of these evaluations (23 %) included costs and/or effects of informal caregiving: 64 % of the Alzheimer's disease studies, 0 % of the metastatic colorectal cancer studies, 13 % of Parkinson's disease studies and 14 % of rheumatoid arthritis studies. When informal care was included, this mostly concerned time costs. Studies rarely included both costs and effects. The effect of including or excluding informal care costs or effects on cost-effectiveness outcomes in most studies was modest, but in some studies the impact was strong.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Most economic evaluations in the area of Alzheimer's disease include costs and/or effects related to informal caregiving. However, in other disease areas where informal caregiving is common it seems that the majority of economic evaluations ignore informal caregiving. The inclusion of informal care can have a strong impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes. Future economic evaluations should therefore consider the relevance of informal care in the context of their study, and either include these costs and effects or justify why they were excluded.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0218-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25315368/,economics

"We provide a model where hospitals compete on quality under fixed prices to investigate how hospital competition affects (i) quality differences between hospitals, and as a result, (ii) health inequalities across hospitals and patient severities. The answer to the first question is ambiguous and depends on factors related to both demand and supply of health care. Whether competition increases or reduces health inequalities depends on the type and measure of inequality. Health inequalities due to the postcode lottery are more likely to decrease if the marginal health gains from quality decrease at a higher rate, whereas health inequalities between high- and low-severity patients decrease if patient composition effects are sufficiently small. We also investigate the effect of competition on health inequalities as measured by the Gini and the Generalised Gini coefficients, and highlight differences compared to the simpler dispersion measures.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2018.12.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30654150/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The scaling up of HIV/AIDS programming has been one of the most extensive undertakings in international public health. Yet decision-makers are encountering significant uncertainties about financing and the need to understand programming costs at different scales of delivery.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To review the economic methodologies for examining costs and variation by scale. To summarize and synthesize the current evidence related to the provision of HIV/AIDS interventions and scaling up.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a review of economic methodologies to generate a conceptual framework for classifying existing data, looking at both short-run and long-run perspectives. A review of the literature was performed using PubMed and available grey literature. Factors facilitating comparison and generalizability are highlighted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There is growing evidence of scale variation among the costs of HIV/AIDS interventions. Scale variation has been found to explain 26-70% of cost variation across locations for similar interventions. Average costs may become larger or smaller as the volume of services expands, depending on the level of coverage and type of intervention. Key constraints to scaling up include infrastructure investments and cost results need to be interpreted in this light.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Evidence to date suggests that cost efficiencies associated with scale may reflect different ways of delivering services at higher volumes, including lower quality outputs. There is still, however, an extremely limited economic evidence base and mechanisms to integrate economic analyses into routine programme monitoring are recommended.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aids.0000327620.47103.1d,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18664950/,economics

"In most countries, governments or health insurers have taken initiatives to influence the price and utilization of medicines. One stated objective of these schemes is to encourage efficiency, or cost-effectiveness. In principle, economic evaluation should to be relevant to decisions about the pricing and reimbursement of health technologies, since it offers a way of estimating the additional value to society of a new intervention (e.g. medicine) relative to current therapy. However, the application of economic evaluation in drug pricing and reimbursement schemes is variable. Therefore, this paper reviews the actual and potential role of economic evaluation in different drug pricing and reimbursement schemes, such as 'free pricing' systems (United Kingdom, United States), two-stage administered systems (France), reference pricing systems (Germany, Netherlands, Sweden) and economic evaluation systems (Australia, Canada). It is concluded that, other than in the case of Australia and Canada, the potential role of economic evaluation could be greatly developed, especially in the case of new medicines, for which there is no close substitute. Comments are also given on the practical problems of using this approach. However, it is noted that economic evaluation alone cannot set a price for a medicine, since a decision has to be made about the proportion of added value going to society and the proportion going to the pharmaceutical company as a reward for innovation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(97)00901-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10168752/,economics

One way to expand demand for dairy products is to find new, economically viable uses for milk. Ex ante economic analysis of new uses for agricultural products anticipates the potential market effects of innovations, and provides a basis for evaluating investment in research and development and setting research priorities. This study evaluated potential economic effects of new applications of films and coatings made from whey protein. An economic simulation model was used to predict the likely effects of the innovations on dairy markets. Cost comparisons with existing technologies and interviews with industry officials were the basis for evaluating potential for commercial adoption of the innovations. The economic simulation model traces the projected increased demand for whey through the markets for dairy products and milk. The associated increased demand for milk could result in benefits to U.S. milk producers of $123.0 million in present value terms, compared to a research cost of $ 4.9 million, with the dairy industry, consumers, and taxpayers all contributing. Interpreting the cost of the research program as an investment on behalf of milk producers, the benefits to producers from development of new whey uses represent an annual rate of return between 28 and 33%. These results are useful for evaluating further investment in the whey research program. The methods illustrated here are applicable to the evaluation of a wide range of research and promotion efforts.",https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.s0022-0302(03)73752-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12778577/,economics
"Systems of universal health care coverage in western industrial societies have usually established some form of government participation in negotiations over physician payment as a means of controlling costs. In the Federal Republic of Germany, a mixed private and public body. Concerted Action in Health Care sets a 'target' for physician and 'sickness fund' negotiators. This indirect form of government participation is effective in 'linking' fees with utilization during negotiations, avoiding inflationary trends inherent in fee-for-service systems. This target-setting factor is a necessary complement to negotiation of a 'pool' of money, wage level and technological adjustment factors, as contained in a model of German economic health care policy. These four elements of economic policy are recommended as cost control measures for office-based physician payments under conditions of universal health care coverage in the United States. Indirect government participation through setting 'targets' for negotiations is seen as consistent with established American institutional practices.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)90297-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8146713/,economics
"This article is about the justifiability of accepting worse cost effectiveness for orphan drugs, that is, treatments for rare diseases, in a publicly financed health care system. Recently, three arguments have been presented that may be used in favour of exceptionally advantageous economic terms for orphan drugs. These arguments share the common feature of all referring to considerations of justice or fairness: the argument of the irrelevance of group size, the argument from the principle of need, and the argument of identifiability. It is argued that all of these arguments fail to support the conclusion that orphan drugs should be subsidized to a larger extent than treatments for common diseases. The argument of the irrelevance fails to distinguish between directly and indirectly relevant considerations of fairness or justice. The recent attempt to revive the moral relevance of identifiability has provided no novel reasons to think that identifiability is morally relevant in itself or due to considerations of fairness and justice. The argument from the principle of need does not fail due to any inherent flaw in the principle as such. Rather, this principle can be interpreted in different ways, and none of these interpretations support exceptionally advantageous terms economically for treating rare diseases specifically. It is concluded that we are awaiting justice based reasons for the preferential treatment of orphan drugs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10728-014-0284-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25145639/,economics
"With all the rhetoric surrounding the impending ""entitlement crisis"" produced by the ""graying of America,"" there has been surprisingly little serious analysis of the social and economic implications of increased longevity and the doubling of the number of elderly people that will occur in this country over the next 30 years. This article identifies five critical areas in which the effect of demographic change will be significant. First, patterns of work life and labor-force participation will almost inevitably change. Second, government expenditures now financed largely by payroll and federal income taxes will increase, whereas those financed by state and local property taxes will fall, at least proportionately. Third, the post-World War II pattern of suburbanized, automobile-dependent communities will pose special challenges to serving an aging population, and new adaptations will need to be developed. Fourth, intrafamily caregiving patterns will necessarily change. Fifth, the level of disability and dependence of older people, for which the rate of change is inherently unpredictable, will have a major effect on all these and other phenomena. Whether one views the net effect of all these changes as a positive or a negative, it is necessary to begin thinking a lot harder and more systematically about all of them.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53495.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131358/,economics
"In 1978 the statement was made that if any more infectious disease specialists were trained they would be culturing one another. The increase in infectious disease consultants continues unabated. The number of training programs in infectious disease is rising in proportion to the number of fellows being trained; one-third of these training programs are in New York, California, and Texas, and a number of them are not associated directly with medical schools. It is often argued that there is no reason to restrict the number of infectious disease consultants because there is plenty for them to do. There are an equal number of arguments against unbridled growth, including the fact that the existence of specialists in most community hospitals with lead to fewer referrals to the teaching centers and the resulting lack of patients will lead training programs to atrophy. Infectious disease is destined to function best as an academic specialty whose trainees should pursue careers primarily as investigators. The number of clinicians leaving training should be reduced and not further glut the marketplace; they should be based in academic divisions and devote their clinical time and effort to the care of complex referral and to indigent patients.",https://doi.org/10.1093/clinids/8.3.478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3726397/,economics

Although the costs of Canada's health system are high by international standards, they are much lower than U.S. costs.

"Background:
        
      
      Medical care utilization has been found to be affected indirectly by changes in economic conditions through associated changes in employment or insurance status. However, if individuals interpret external macroeconomic conditions as employment risk, they may alter decisions to seek care even if they remain both employed and insured.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To examine the relationship between macroeconomic fluctuations and the medical care usage of Americans who are both employed and insured.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      Restricting the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 1995 to 2008 to respondents whose employment status and insurance status did not change, we employed a fixed-effect Poisson model to examine the association between state average annual unemployment rates and the utilization of 12 medical services.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average annual state unemployment rate was found to be a significant factor in hospital outpatient visits (P < 0.01) and emergency room visits (P < 0.01). A one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was found to produce an additional 0.67 hospital outpatient visits and 0.14 emergency room visits.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      State unemployment rates were found statistically significantly associated with several of the medical services studied, suggesting macroeconomic conditions are an important factor in the medical decisions of employed and insured individuals. Thus, policy changes that increase access among the unemployed or uninsured may mitigate this employment risk effect and create incentives that potentially alter the utilization decisions among those currently both employed and insured.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000000051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309667/,economics
"Many firms that employ low-wage workers cannot afford to offer an employee health plan, and many of the uninsured work for such firms. This article makes the case for an employer tax credit, administered by the Internal Revenue Service, as a way to extend health coverage to uninsured workers and their families. The permanent, fixed-dollar, refundable credit would be available to all low-wage employers (those with average wages of $10 per hour and less), including those already offering coverage. The credit would be graduated depending on average wage: the maximum credit would equal 50% of the cost of a standard benefit package; the minimum would equal 30% of the package. It also would vary by family size and could be used to cover part-time and temporary workers. Participating employers would be required to pay at least 50% of the health insurance premium, proof of which would be shown on firms' tax returns. The paper provides justification for this approach. It closes with a discussion of strengths and weaknesses of this approach and alternative design features.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_38.2.202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11529516/,economics
"Animal health economics is a relatively new discipline which makes use of concepts, procedures and data to support the decision-making process with the objective of optimising animal health management. As the economic impact of most diseases that afflict farmed livestock is typically greater at the sub-clinical rather than the clinical level, animal health management often involves decisions regarding expenditure on preventive measure as well as the treatment of obviously sick animals. Animal health programmes have been shown to provide a very high return on investment. This is because reduction of the impact of disease increases the efficiency of production, often without the need for additional inputs such as feed or labour. The analytical techniques described in this chapter are the simplest, most useful, and most commonly used by animal health economists. Most decisions in animal health economics at the farm level can be arrived at by using partial budgeting, decision tree analysis, or cost-benefit analysis techniques--either alone or in combination. Regardless of the technique chosen, the analysis is only as good as the quality of the data used.",https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.18.2.1170,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10472673/,economics
"Workplaces vary enormously in the amount of harmful stress they produce, even within specific economic sectors. Stress of certain kinds and at certain levels tend to produce health harms and costs that are borne not only by individual employees and employers but also by families and society at large. Variations in stress levels within economic sectors can be traced to variations in management practices that govern key conditions of work involving demand, effort, control and reward. The costs of stress-related disorders produced by adverse governance practices are transferred outside the workplace in varying degrees. The actual extent of this cost transfer depends on policies and programs within the workplace. We can characterize workplaces according to a typology in which the key dimensions are commitment to abate harm through participatory management practices and the effectiveness and efficiency of harm containment through programs such as employee assistance and health promotion. The most health-promoting and cost-avoiding workplaces foster high control, high reward conditions and support employees with employee assistance and health promotion programs. The policy implications of this observation are drawn out.",https://doi.org/10.1108/13660759910266775,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10537851/,economics
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Anterior ocular inflammatory disease (AOID) affects more that 40% of the U.S. population, which includes ocular allergies, various forms of infectious conjunctivitis, and dry eye diseases (tear film dysfunction). This review evaluates the recent economic costs of AOID treatment.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Rapid advances in pharmacotherapy of the anterior surface of the eye have been made as the expansion of the immunopathophysiology underlying these disorders ranging from the innate Toll-like receptors to the more specific IgE receptors are being unravelled. Even with these advances in AOID immunopathophysiology, progressive new treatments that address inflammatory mediators and their receptors with advancements in the development of ophthalmic remain limited. In 2011, AOID represents 40% of cost associated with ophthalmic drugs focusing on dry eye (31%), anti-infectives (30%), anti-allergics (25%), and anti-inflammatory agents (14%). With rising treatment costs, a need for cost-effective medicines remains to be pursued along with the development of treatment algorithms to maximize the therapeutic outcomes.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The economic burden of AOID has dramatically increased in recent years, with prescription drug expenditure approaching approximately $7 billion.

"The Government of Madagascar is trying to reduce deforestation and conserve biodiversity through creating new protected areas in the eastern rainforests. While this has many benefits, forest use restriction may bring costs to farmers at the forest frontier. We explored this through a series of surveys in five sites around the Corridor Ankeniheny Zahamena new protected area and adjacent national parks. In phase one a stratified random sample of 603 households completed a household survey covering demographic and socio-economic characteristics, and a choice experiment to estimate the opportunity costs of conservation. A stratified sub-sample (n = 171) then completed a detailed agricultural survey (including recording inputs and outputs from 721 plots) and wild-harvested product survey. The data have been archived with ReShare (UK Data Service). Together these allow a deeper understanding of the household economy on the forest frontier in eastern Madagascar and their swidden agricultural system, the benefits households derive from the forests through wild-harvested products, and the costs of conservation restrictions to forest edge communities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.225,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30351304/,economics
"We present a new framework for assessing the effects of hospital closures on social welfare and the local economy. While patient welfare necessarily declines when patients lose access to a hospital, closures also tend to reduce costs. We study five hospital closures in two states and find that urban hospital bailouts reduce aggregate social welfare: on balance, the cost savings from closures more than offset the reduction in patient welfare. However, because some of the cost savings are shared nationally, total surplus in the local community may decline following a hospital closure.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2009.10.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20004489/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      For almost a decade, public and private organizations have pressured hospitals to improve their patient safety records. Since 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has no longer been reimbursing hospitals for secondary diagnoses not reported during the point of admission. This ruling has motivated some hospitals to engage in safety-oriented programs to decrease adverse events.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      This study examined which hospitals may engage in patient safety solutions and whether they create these patient safety solutions within their structures or use suppliers in the market.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      We used a theoretical model that incorporates the key constructs of resource dependence theory and transaction cost economics theory to predict a hospital's reaction to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ""never event"" regulations. We present propositions that speculate on how forces conceptualized from the resource dependence theory may affect adoption of patient safety innovations and, when they do, whether the adopting hospitals will do so internally or externally according to the transaction cost economics theory.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      On the basis of forces identified by the resource dependence theory, we predict that larger, teaching, safety net, horizontally integrated, highly interdependent, and public hospitals in concentrated, high public payer presence, competitive, and resource-rich environments will be more likely to engage in patient safety innovations. Following the logic of the transaction cost economics theory, we predict that of the hospitals that react positively to the never event regulation, most will internalize their innovations in patient safety solutions rather than approach the market, a choice that helps hospitals economize on transaction costs.
    


          Practice implications:

"This study complements existing literature by examining the nexus between energy consumption (EC), CO2 emissions (CE), and economic growth (GDP; gross domestic product) in 24 African countries using a panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. The following findings are established. First, there is a long-run relationship between EC, CE, and GDP. Second, a long-term effect from CE to GDP and EC is apparent, with reciprocal paths. Third, the error correction mechanisms are consistently stable. However, in cases of disequilibrium, only EC can be significantly adjusted to its long-run relationship. Fourth, there is a long-run causality running from GDP and CE to EC. Fifth, we find causality running from either CE or both CE and EC to GDP, and inverse causal paths are observable. Causality from EC to GDP is not strong, which supports the conservative hypothesis. Sixth, the causal direction from EC to GDP remains unobservable in the short term. By contrast, the opposite path is observable. There are also no short-run causalities from GDP, or EC, or EC, and GDP to EC.

"Health equity is one of the main avowed objectives of public health policy across the world. Yet economic evaluations in public health (like those in health care more generally) continue to focus on maximizing health gain. Health equity considerations are rarely mentioned. Health economists rely on the quasi-egalitarian value judgment that 'a QALY is a QALY'--that is QALYs are equally weighted and the same health outcome is worth the same no matter how it is achieved or to whom it accrues. This value judgment is questionable in many important circumstances in public health. For example, policy-makers may place rather little value on health outcomes achieved by infringing individual liberties or by discriminating on the basis of age, sex, or race. Furthermore, there is evidence that a majority of the general public wish to give greater weight to health gains accruing to children, the severely ill, and, to a lesser extent, the socio-economically disadvantaged. This paper outlines four approaches to explicit incorporation of equity considerations into economic evaluation in public health: (i) review of background information on equity, (ii) health inequality impact assessment, (iii) analysis of the opportunity cost of equity, and (iv) equity weighting of health outcomes. The first three approaches can readily be applied using standard methods of health technology assessment, where suitable data are available; whereas approaches for generating equity weights remain experimental. The potential benefits of considering equity are likely to be largest in cases involving: (a) interventions that target disadvantaged individuals or communities and are also relatively cost-ineffective and (b) interventions to encourage lifestyle change, which may be relatively ineffective among 'hard-to-reach' disadvantaged groups and hence may require re-design to avoid increasing health inequalities.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133109004903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216834/,economics
"Cost-sharing for health care is high on the policy agenda in many European countries that struggle with deficits in their public budget. However, such policy often meets with public opposition, which might delay or even prevent its implementation. Increased reliance on patient payments may also have adverse equity effects, especially in countries where informal patient payments are widespread. The factors which might influence the presence of both, formal and informal payments can be found in economic, governance and cultural differences between countries. The aim of this paper is to review the formal-informal payment mix in Europe and to outline factors associated with this mix. We use quantitative analyses of macro-data for 35 European countries and a qualitative description of selected country experiences. The results suggest that the presence of obligatory cost-sharing for health care services is associated with governance factors, while informal patient payments are a multi-cause phenomenon. A consensus-based policy, supported by evidence and stakeholders' engagement, might contribute to a more sustainable patient payment policy. In some European countries, the implementation of cost-sharing requires policy actions to reduce other patient payment obligations, including measures to eliminate informal payments.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.09.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24149101/,economics

"Discount cosmetic surgery is a topic of interest to plastic surgeons. To understand this trend and its effects on plastic surgeons, it is necessary to review the economics of cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery's practice environment, and the broader business principles of service industries. Recent work looked at the economics of the plastic surgery market. This analysis demonstrated that increased local density of plastic surgeons was associated with lower adjusted fees for cosmetic procedures. A survey of plastic surgeons about their practice environment revealed that 93 percent categorized the majority of their patients as very or moderately price-sensitive. Fully 98 percent described their business climate as very or moderately competitive and most plastic surgeons thought they lost a sizable number of cosmetic patients within the last year for reasons of price.A standard industry analysis, when applied to cosmetic surgery, reveals the following: an increased number of surgeons leads to lower fees (reducing their bargaining power as suppliers), patients are price-sensitive (increasing their bargaining power as buyers), and there are few barriers to entry among providers (allowing potential new entrants into the market). Such a situation is conducive to discounting taking hold-and even becoming the industry norm. In this environment, business strategy dictates there are three protocols for success: discounting, differentiation, and focus. Discounting joins the trend toward cutting fees. Success comes from increasing volume and efficiency and thus preserving profits. Differentiation creates an industrywide perception of uniqueness; this requires broadly positioning plastic surgeons as holders of a distinct brand identity separate from other ""cosmetic surgeons."" The final strategy is to focus on a particular buyer group to develop a market niche, such as establishing a ""Park Avenue"" practice catering to patients who demand a prestigious surgeon, although this is likely a small segment of the overall patient population. Plastic surgeons that buck the trend toward discount cosmetic surgery must take concrete and potentially costly steps to implement a plausible strategy for distinguishing their practices within the crowded cosmetic surgery market.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00006534-200208000-00039,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12142686/,economics

"With the continued increase in medical expenditures and the growing awareness that resources are not limitless, there is increasing pressure to curb health care costs and to establish priorities. As potential solutions are proposed and implemented, there is understandable concern that policy choices may adversely affect both the access to and the quality of care. Economic analyses are one tool used to optimize resource allocation decisions. The primary goal of these analyses is to maximize value and efficiency, not necessarily to decrease spending. The current focus on cost cutting is often associated with a more truncated, nonsocietal perspective (e.g., that of the payer or provider). To be most useful, these analyses must be methodologically rigorous. Standard guidelines, such as those established by Eisenberg, are helpful. As shown in the reports applicable to head and neck malignancies that have been discussed here, many articles published in the clinical literature must be interpreted cautiously, because fundamental methodological concerns (e.g., using costs rather than charges, discounting to a common base year) were frequently not addressed. Economic investigations are one aspect of the broader fields of outcomes and health services research. It is easy to underestimate how greatly economic studies depend on the availability of high quality noneconomic data. In that context, current initiatives in evidence-based medicine (EBM), using the best available evidence (considering for example, the type of trial, the quality of the research, and the credentials of the researcher) to help clinicians practice in situations where doubt may exist in the diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis of patients, will likely grow in importance. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and systematic literature reviews are manifestations of this trend. Historically, disease control measures and survival have been the primary and points in clinical cancer studies. Economic analyses and studies evaluating other end points (e.g., function, quality of life) will likely play a larger role in the future in evaluating the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of head, neck and other malignancies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70098-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10494519/,economics
"How to promote corporate research and development is a particularly important issue under the background of the economy being diverted out of the real economy. By selecting samples of 1221 Chinese A-share non-financial listed companies from 2010 to 2019, this paper examines the impact of financialization on research and development through the panel threshold regression model. Then, the moderate range of the impact of financialization on corporate research and development is measured, as well as their heterogeneity is also analyzed. The research shows the following results: first, there is a dynamic relationship and moderate range between financialization and corporate research and development. Financialization has a positive effect on corporate research and development when the level of financialization exceeds 0.4748. Secondly, from further heterogeneous research, financialization has a threshold effect on research and development among enterprises with a high level of research and development. In addition, there is a promoting effect on corporate research and development only when their financialization level exceeds 0.0097 in enterprises with a high level of research and development. Therefore, in order to promote corporate research and development, financialization of non-financial enterprises should make adjustment and regulation according to the action and direction of moderate range.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253380,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34191824/,economics
"In-use stock of a product is the amount of the product in active use. In-use product stocks provide various functions or services on which we rely in our daily work and lives, and the concept of in-use product stock for industrial ecologists is similar to the concept of net manufactured capital stock for economists. This study estimates historical physical in-use stocks of 91 products and 9 product groups and uses monetary data on net capital stocks of 56 products to either approximate or compare with in-use stocks of the corresponding products in the United States. Findings include the following: (i) The development of new products and the buildup of their in-use stocks result in the increase in variety of in-use product stocks and of manufactured capital; (ii) substitution among products providing similar or identical functions reflects the improvement in quality of in-use product stocks and of manufactured capital; and (iii) the historical evolution of stocks of the 156 products or product groups in absolute, per capita, or per-household terms shows that stocks of most products have reached or are approaching an upper limit. Because the buildup, renewal, renovation, maintenance, and operation of in-use product stocks drive the anthropogenic cycles of materials that are used to produce products and that originate from natural capital, the determination of in-use product stocks together with modeling of anthropogenic material cycles provides an analytic perspective on the material linkage between manufactured capital and natural capital.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1406866112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25733904/,economics
"Health care interventions may affect the health of patients' family networks. It has been suggested that these ""health spillovers"" should be included in economic evaluation, but there is not a systematic method for doing this. In this article, we develop a framework for including health spillovers in economic evaluation. We focus on extra-welfarist economic evaluations where the objective is to maximize health benefits from a health care budget (the ""health care perspective""). Our framework involves adapting the conventional cost-effectiveness decision rule to include 2 multiplier effects to internalize the spillover effects. These multiplier effects express the ratio of total health effects (for patients and their family networks) to patient health effects. One multiplier effect is specified for health benefit generated from providing a new intervention, one for health benefit displaced by funding this intervention. We show that using multiplier effects to internalize health spillovers could change the optimal funding decisions and generate additional health benefits to society.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x15605094,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26377370/,economics
"This article discusses the impact on patients of changes in copayments and safety net thresholds (SNT) within the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Trends in the nominal and real values of copayments and SNTs are examined, as are changes in the numbers of types of patients. The relationship between the number of safety net cardholders and copayments and SNTs is estimated. Increases in the number of copayments necessary to reach the safety net threshold restrict the number of patients able to benefit from this provision. Policy for determining the levels of copayments and safety net thresholds needs to be put on a rationale basis in a way similar to the determination of prices for PBS medicines.",https://doi.org/10.1071/ah090215,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19563310/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the ability of transaction costs theory to explain incentives in the health care chain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a case study of CPS, a health insurance company in Bogota (Colombia), which preferred not to publish its name.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CPS moves in the environment of high transaction costs and uses the hybrid form of governance at the outpatient level. Incentive intensity, administrative control and the contract all agree with the theory. At the hospital level, the market is used, despite greater uncertainty. Because of the discrete form (1.0) of the incentives and the absence of administrative control, it is difficult for CPS to relate payment to hospital performance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Transaction costs theory explains the configuration of incentives. Another contribution made by this theory to the literature is the criterion to differentiate between the market and the hybrid. We propose that the market uses discrete-type (1.0) incentives, while the hybrid uses continuous, commission-like incentives.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2011.07.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21917362/,economics
"Over the last few years, global warming and rapid climate change have become major risk factors that pose a serious threat to global security. A key factor behind these risk factors is greenhouse gases, which emit mainly carbon dioxide (CO2). The existing literature seeks to determine the economic and non-economic aspects of CO2 emissions to prevent environmental degradation. However, the effects of economic policy uncertainty and foreign direct investment on CO2 emissions are undeniable. This study examines the impact of economic policy uncertainty and foreign direct investment on CO2 emissions in the panel of 24 developed and developing nations from 2001 to 2019. After verifying cross-sectional dependency and co-integration among parameters, the dynamic seemingly unrelated regression and panel vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality methods are used for long-run estimates and verify the causal link among variables. Our findings show that economic policy uncertainty, economic growth, trade, and energy consumption adversely impact the environment, while foreign direct investment enhances sample countries' environmental quality. Furthermore, a bidirectional relationship exists between CO2, economic policy uncertainty, economic growth, trade, and energy consumption. In addition, this study observed similar results in a robustness analysis using the dynamic common correlated effects and fixed effect panel quantile regression frameworks. Based on the inclusive outcomes, this study forms significant suggestions for policy implications. Specifically, policymakers should design environmental-friendly trade policies, explore renewable energy options, and implement green investment and financing strategies to improve the environment.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15715-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34378130/,economics
"Information on the economic burden of malaria in Africa is needed to target interventions efficiently and equitably, and to justify investment in research and control. A standard method of estimation has been to sum the direct costs of expenditure on prevention and treatment, and the indirect costs of productive labour time lost. This paper discusses the many problems in using such data to reflect the burden to society or the potential benefits from control. Studies have generally focussed on febrile illness, overestimating the burden of uncomplicated malaria, but underestimating the costs of severe illness, other debilitating manifestations, and mortality. Many use weak data to calculate indirect costs, which fail to account for seasonal variations, the difference between the average and marginal product of labour, and the ways households and firms 'cope' in response to illness episodes. Perhaps most importantly, the costs of coping mechanisms in response to the risk of disease are excluded, although they may significantly affect productive strategies and economic growth. Future work should be rooted in a sound understanding of the health burden of malaria and the organisation of economic activities, and address the impact on the productive environment, and epidemiological and socio-economic geographical variation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(02)00036-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468115/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the economic cost of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in 31 provincial-level administrative regions and in total, in China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used data from government reports, clinical guidelines and other publications to estimate the main cost components of COVID-19 during 1 January-31 March 2020. These components were: identification and diagnosis of close contacts; suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19; treatment of COVID-19 cases; compulsory quarantine of close contacts and suspected cases; and productivity losses for all affected residents. Primary outcomes were total health-care and societal costs.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The total estimated health-care and societal costs associated with COVID-19 were 4.26 billion Chinese yuan (¥; 0.62 billion United States dollars, US$) and ¥ 2646.70 billion (US$ 383.02 billion), respectively. Inpatient care accounted for 44.2% (¥ 0.95 billion/¥ 2.15 billion) of routine health-care costs followed by medicines, accounting for 32.5% (¥ 0.70 billion/¥ 2.15 billion). Productivity losses accounted for 99.8% (¥ 2641.61 billion/¥ 2646.70 billion) of societal costs, which were mostly attributable to the effect of movement-restriction policies on people who did not have COVID-19. Societal costs were most sensitive to salary costs and number of working days lost due to movement-restriction policies. Hubei province had the highest health-care cost while Guangdong province had the highest societal cost.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results highlight the high economic burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The control measures to prevent the spread of disease resulted in substantial costs from productivity losses amounting to 2.7% (US$ 382.29 billion/US$ 14.14 trillion) of China's annual gross domestic product.",https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.267112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33551505/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Use of evidence on clinical effectiveness that is of poor quality or is biased in favour of the therapy under study is a concern in economic evaluations and may contribute to a mistrust of pharmacoeconomic studies. This study aimed to determine whether the authors of economic evaluations use the best available evidence for clinical effectiveness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred economic evaluations of drug therapies (published in 2001-2003) were sampled randomly from the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and the source of clinical evidence was identified. For each therapy, alternative, high quality sources of clinical effectiveness data were sought by searching the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and Health Technology Assessment databases. The magnitude and direction of the effect size in the different sources of evidence were compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Relevant systematic reviews were found for only 32 of the 100 economic evaluations in the sample. In three cases these reviews had been identified by the authors of the economic evaluations and two of these cases were used in the evaluation. Comparisons were possible in 21 cases. The clinical effects reported in all 21 comparisons were similar in direction but differed in magnitude. Compared to the systematic reviews, the authors of economic evaluations used evidence that was more favourable in five cases, less favourable in four cases, and similar in 12 cases. Six of the economic evaluations and corresponding systematic reviews did not present measures of effectiveness in a manner that allowed comparison.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Authors of economic evaluations have not made sufficient use of the evidence available from systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness. The central role of economic evaluations in health policy makes it essential that improvements in economic methods are accompanied by a structured search for the highest quality information on clinical effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.1258/135581907781543067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17716415/,economics
"Economic issues have a prominent place in the debate about reforming the U.S. health care system. If more rational allocations of health care resources are to occur, the principles of decision analysis and clinical economics will need to be understood and used to assess current and new technologies. This requires an explicit assessment of the costs and benefits of a health care intervention, defining the current standard intervention, and clarifying the perspective of the assessment (societal, patient, payer, or provider). Detailed cost accounting of resources is optimal in contrast to costs or charges. These principles were included in 1992 proposed Canadian guidelines for using economic evaluations for adoption of new technologies. Such guidelines provide further impetus for the economic assessment of phase III clinical trials. When applied to peripheral blood progenitor cells, future studies should assess the incremental benefits of the strategy using the progenitor cells, not just the cost savings compared to traditional autologous bone marrow transplantation.",https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.1.1993.2.501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8087498/,economics
"Health economics has experienced a substantial rise within the healthcare industry over the past few years. Several disciplines have developed new techniques to evaluate the economic impact of pharmaceuticals in clinical care. Clinicians, pharmacists, economists, epidemiologists, and operations researchers have contributed to this field. Given the economic reality that resources are limited and needs and expectations are not infinite, medical economists try to find solutions on how these resources can be allocated optimally, to maximize the production of health or what society perceives as health. Health economists differentiate allocation efficiency and production efficiency. From the perspective of a health insurance plan allocation efficiency is reached when those drug classes or clinical programs are covered that will produce most health per expenditure. This requires a common monetary metric of health gains across the broad spectrum of diseases, conditions, and health outcomes. Once it is decided to cover a specific treatment or clinical program, economists try to identify the most cost-effective product within a class of comparable choices using cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. Both allocation and production efficiency are two critically important concepts for the economic success of biotech products. This article will provide a rationale why health economics is critically important for the future of healthcare and explains fundamental economic tools for evaluating products and services with special emphasis on gene-derived technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-26980-0_19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15648197/,economics

          Material and methods:
        
      
      After performing an internet search about the rapidly growing market for qualifications measures in health economics, we hence conducted an anonymous survey for ENT senior doctors and directors of the 34 German University Departments to evaluate their attitude towards, as well as their expectation of such an add-on qualification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Since the German government finalized the health care reform in the year 2000 such qualification measures rapidly developed: amongst others, 26 postgraduate, extra-occupational master programs have been inaugurated. The anonymous survey was answered by 105 ENT doctors (63 senior doctors, 27 vice professors and 15 directors). 63% out of these 105 colleagues considered such an add-on qualification to be mandatory. 41% of the colleagues were already ""add-on qualified"" in that field, only 10 of them by means of a study program. 71 of 105 colleagues (68%) considered the add-on qualification to be advantageous for their future personal career.

"This paper examines the impact of economic growth, energy consumption, financial development, and industrialization on environmental degradation in 8 selected ASEAN + 3 countries covering the period 1994-2018. The autoregressive distributed lag model pooled mean group was applied to estimate the long run and short relationship. The fully modified ordinary least squares, dynamic least squares, and seemingly unrelated regression were applied to check the robustness of pooled mean group. Furthermore, panel Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality test was utilized to explore the causal relationships among the variables. The results of cointegration tests confirm the presence of the long run cointegration relationship. The empirical findings, in the long run, demonstrate that the elasticity of economic growth is negatively interrelated to environmental degradation. The elasticities of energy consumption and financial development showed a positive relationship with environmental degradation. The elasticity of industrialization has a negative connection with environmental degradation. The robustness results show some conflict with the autoregressive distributed lag model pooled mean group results. Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality demonstrates a bidirectional causality between economic growth and environmental degradation, energy consumption and environmental degradation, and economic growth and energy consumption. These results confirm that energy consumption and financial development harm environmental quality in selected countries through exudating more CO2 emissions in space, while economic growth and industrialization reduce environmental degradation by mitigating exudate CO2 emissions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18560-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35013968/,economics

"This article offers a brief summary of the factors that the author believes should be considered when analyzing the multiple interrelations between the economic crisis and its effects on public finances, social spending, and the health and welfare of Spaniards. For the sake of brevity, a linear argument is followed, with the basic contents of the message, leaving some of the more controversial issues whose interpretation may be heavily influenced by ideology to the discussion. The core of the argument is that, despite the double dip of the Spanish recession, healthcare has survived the consequences of the crisis fairly well. This is particularly the case when the situation is analyzed in terms of the share of public expenditure to GDP and in per capita terms, given the evolution of these ratios, although the final effect is unknown in terms of the actual and potential beneficiaries. This relatively low incidence so far on the health of Spaniards is basically due to family networks, pooling their incomes, and to the acceptance by Spanish health professionals of budget cuts, which have allowed services and their apparent quality to be maintained, contrasting with private employment and public finances. Obviously, this is not a guarantee of sustainability unless economic growth recovers. Even if the Spanish economy and public finances improve, the composition of health care delivery needs to be reevaluated to achieve a new allocation between public and private responsibilities for healthcare in accordance with the social development of the 21st century.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2014.02.020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24863990/,economics

"The Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) is finally here. A system designed to equate physician work across the specialties, it has its own peculiar and unique problems. Modeling of the system was based on the single physician-patient interaction; it may not work properly for laboratory specialties. There are other unique considerations concerning how the model was constructed. Although data were collected specifically for nuclear medicine, they were not used in the final computations. There is disagreement over whether those data would benefit or hurt nuclear medicine reimbursement. As presently implemented, the RBRVS poses grave dangers for the future of nuclear medicine. These dangers come not only in the professional reimbursement section of the rules but in the technical component areas as well. Estimates for reduction of income by 1996 range as high as 55% for nuclear medicine. When one factors the implementation of the RBRVS by independent insurance carriers into the equation, the entire economic future becomes muddy. A brief historical review of the RBRVS, as well as discussion of potential future implications of this type of reimbursement system, is presented.

"Escalating health care costs have stimulated a paradigm change in the way health care is delivered, reimbursed, and evaluated. Reducing the length of hospital stay and controlling the cost of new technologies and therapies are major factors driving health care decisions. Economic evaluations have had variable success in the decision-making process, partly due to the overall quality, interpretation, and reporting of published analyses. Compared with other Gram-positive pathogens, the economic impact of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections remains the most studied. MRSA infections clearly represent a significant clinical and fiscal burden and future studies analyzing cost-effective strategies that encompass their prevention and optimal management would be beneficial.

"The faculty of economics at today's Humboldt University in Berlin, as no other institution of economics, has witnessed three radical ruptures in its history: in 1933, National Socialism replaced the pluralism prevailing in the Weimar Republic by imposing a ""German economics""; after WWII, GDR authorities replaced this NS regime by imposing a Marxist imperative, which after the fall of the wall was replaced by the Western standards of neoclassical economics. In reconstructing these three reforms, institutional history can serve as a context in which questions about the political nature of economic knowledge can be answered that remain speculative in a conceptual context. I thus present a natural experiment in the political epistemology of economics: How do economists respond to, resist, and stabilize, changing political regimes? How do economists renegotiate the autonomy of economic knowledge given changing demands as of its social task? Among others, I show that contrary to Robert Merton's old, but still widely held thesis in political epistemology-that the values of science are compatible only with democratic regimes-the totalitarian and authoritarian regimes created better conditions for methodological pluralism in economics than democratic society.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2015.01.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26227228/,economics
"If consumers have a choice of health plan, risk selection is often a serious problem (e.g., as in Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, the United States of America, and Switzerland). Risk selection may threaten the quality of care for chronically ill people, and may reduce the affordability and efficiency of healthcare. Therefore, an important question is: how can the regulator show evidence of (no) risk selection? Although this seems easy, showing such evidence is not straightforward. The novelty of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a conceptual framework for showing evidence of risk selection in competitive health insurance markets. It is not easy to disentangle risk selection and the insurers' efficiency. We suggest two methods to measure risk selection that are not biased by the insurers' efficiency. Because these measures underestimate the true risk selection, we also provide a list of signals of selection that can be measured and that, in particular in combination, can show evidence of risk selection. It is impossible to show the absence of risk selection. Second, we empirically measure risk selection among the switchers, taking into account the insurers' efficiency. Based on 2-year administrative data on healthcare expenses and risk characteristics of nearly all individuals with basic health insurance in the Netherlands (N > 16 million) we find significant risk selection for most health insurers.

In this lecture, I tried to think about the idea of technology value in Neurology and the evaluation of doctor fee in public health system. It was a purpose to maximize well-being in the society. Medical value is that expressing by the performance of cost-effectiveness is an ideal. On the other hand, the total work and the resource cost with a lot of reports have both merits and demerits respectively. It is necessary to explain the technology of Neurology with combinations by three indexes of the total work and the resource cost and the outcome.",https://doi.org/10.5692/clinicalneurol.50.1055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21921563/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Early research demonstrated that patients' length-of-stay and inpatient costs varied according to their health insurance status. The authors of the current report studied a population-based sample of privately insured, Medicaid-insured, and uninsured inpatients ages 21 to 64 years who underwent surgical resection for either nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 781) or colorectal cancer (CRC) (n = 8190) or who underwent mastectomy (n = 6201) to compare length of stay and inpatient costs by insurance status.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data for this study were derived from all civilian, acute-care hospitals in Virginia from 1999 to 2005. Hierarchical generalized linear models were used to estimate the relation between the explanatory variables and lengths of stay and costs. All analyses controlled for patient characteristics and hospital random effects.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Medicaid-insured patients with NSCLC had longer lengths of stay (39% or 2.64 days longer) and higher inpatient costs (20% or $2479 higher costs). Uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients with CRC had longer lengths of stay and higher inpatient costs. In contrast, uninsured patients with breast cancer had 11% shorter lengths of stay and 12% lower inpatient costs than privately insured patients. Medicaid-insured patients had 10% lower inpatient costs than privately insured patients. Differences were no longer statistically significant when reconstruction was added to the models.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Health insurance affected the need for health care and the amount of health care received. Uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients with lung cancer and colon cancer who underwent resection had longer lengths of stay and higher inpatient costs than privately insured patients, but they had shorter lengths of stay when reconstruction was not provided. Among the patients with breast cancer, patients and/or providers economized on discretionary procedures.",https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.27508,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22415708/,economics
"Risk-sharing agreements, under which payers and pharmaceutical manufacturers agree to link payment for drugs to health outcomes achieved, rather than the volume of products used, offer an appealing payment model for pharmaceuticals. Although such agreements have been widely touted, the experience to date mainly demonstrates how hard they are to implement. Barriers include high implementation costs, measurement challenges, and the absence of a suitable data infrastructure. Risk-sharing arrangements could gain traction in the United States as payers and product manufacturers acquire experience with the concept and as measurement techniques and information systems improve. For the foreseeable future, they are likely to remain the exception as drug companies pursue payment models unconnected to data collection or performance assessment.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22147861/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Many large employers offer flexible spending accounts (FSAs) to shelter their employees' out-of-pocket medical expenses from taxes and thereby to encourage the purchase of health insurance policies with higher cost sharing. However, very little empirical research has examined the individual employee's decision to contribute to an FSA.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To estimate equations for the probability that single employees with no dependents and employees with family health insurance coverage will contribute to FSAs, and the amounts contributed by those with FSAs.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      An observational study of randomly-selected employees in 15 Minnesota firms matched with information on the strategies those firms use to promote FSAs. Measures of FSA participation were regressed on expected health care spending, employee socio-demographics, and employer strategies.
    


          Subjects:
        
      
      779 single employees with no dependents and 679 employees with family coverage.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Education beyond high school increases the probability that both types of subjects will contribute to FSAs, with marginal effects ranging from 16 to 48 percent. The FSA contribution rate for families doubles when the family's marginal federal income tax rate increases from 15 to 28 percent. Employer strategies to encourage participation are also effective in promoting FSAs.

"The coverage expansions planned under the Affordable Care Act are to be financed in part by slowing Medicare payment updates to hospitals, thereby reigniting the debate over whether low prices paid by public payers cause hospitals to increase prices to private insurers--a practice known as cost shifting. Recently, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) proposed an alternative explanation of hospital pricing and profitability that could be used to support policies that pressure hospitals to reduce overall costs rather than to only raise prices. This study evaluated the cost-shift and MedPAC perspectives using 2008 data on hospital margins for 30,514 Medicare and privately insured patients undergoing any of seven major procedures in markets where robust hospital competition exists and in markets where hospital care is concentrated in the hands of a few providers. The study presents empirical evidence that, faced with shortfalls between Medicare payments and projected costs, hospitals in concentrated markets focus on raising prices to private insurers, while hospitals in competitive markets focus on cutting costs. Policy makers need to examine whether efforts to promote clinical coordination through provider integration may interfere with efforts to restrain overall health care cost growth by restraining Medicare payment rates.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0220,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21734199/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the economic burden of depression in the Asia Pacific region, review the negative economic consequences attributable to depression, and describe the reimbursement policies for health-care services throughout the Asia Pacific region.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Both direct and indirect costs were obtained via a literature review of international mental health journals. Disability adjusted life year (DALYs) estimates were obtained from the World Health Organization. Reimbursement policy data were obtained from personal communication with the SEBoD International Advisory Board.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There are only two studies of the economic costs of depression in the Asia Pacific region. From these, the total cost of depression in Australia for 1997-98 was estimated as US$1.8 billion (22% direct costs), and in Taiwan for 1994 as US$1.4 billion (25% direct costs). In the year 2000, it was estimated that unipolar major depression accounted for 14.2 million DALYs in China and 22.7 million DALYs for all other Asia Pacific countries. The majority of Asia Pacific health-care systems have extensive insurance coverage, but not specific provisions for depression. However, relatively low overall fee schedules diminish financial barriers for outpatient treatment of depression.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Untreated depression is a very costly disorder across the Asia Pacific region, with indirect costs constituting a substantial proportion. Consequently, treatment of depression should be the focus of policy makers to avoid major negative cost repercussions. It is encouraging that most Asia Pacific health service reimbursement policies enable the treatment of depression (especially outpatient treatment) to be relatively affordable. To advance this issue, the paucity of specific information on the epidemiology of depression, as well as service use and cost, needs to be addressed.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1039-8562.2004.02100.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15715825/,economics

We analyzed health financing and expenditure variables in the municipalities of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, describing the trend and the relationship between them. Data showed the growth of the variables and trend towards homogeneity. The exception was for the participation of Intergovernmental Transfers in the Total Health Expenditure of the Municipality. We found a significant correlation between Budget Revenue per capita and Health Expenditure per capita and a strong significant negative correlation between Inflation Rate, Budget Revenue per capita and Health Expenditure per capita. We concluded that increased health expenditure is due more to higher municipal tax revenue than to increased transfers that, in relative terms, did not increase. The strong inverse relationship between inflation rate and the Financing and Expenditure variables show that the monetary policy's inflation goals have restricted health financing to municipalities.",https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232017226.05252016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614517/,economics
"There are marked differences in methods used for undertaking economic evaluations across low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. We outline the most apparent dissimilarities and reflect on their underlying reasons. We randomly sampled 50 studies from each of three country income groups from a comprehensive database of 2844 economic evaluations published between January 2012 and May 2014. Data were extracted on ten methodological areas: (i) availability of guidelines; (ii) research questions; (iii) perspective; (iv) cost data collection methods; (v) cost data analysis; (vi) outcome measures; (vii) modelling techniques; (viii) cost-effectiveness thresholds; (ix) uncertainty analysis; and (x) applicability. Comparisons were made across income groups and odds ratios calculated. Contextual heterogeneity rightly drives some of the differences identified. Other differences appear less warranted and may be attributed to variation in government health sector capacity, in health economics research capacity and in expectations of funders, journals and peer reviewers. By highlighting these differences, we seek to start a debate about the underlying reasons why they have occurred and to what extent the differences are conducive for methodological advancements. We suggest a number of specific areas in which researchers working in countries of differing environments could learn from one another.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26775571/,economics
"Effective January 1, 2011, individual market health insurers must meet a minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) of 80%. This law aims to encourage 'productive' forms of competition by increasing the proportion of premium dollars spent on clinical benefits. To date, very little is known about the performance of firms in the individual health insurance market, including how MLRs are related to insurer and market characteristics. The MLR comprises one component of the price-cost margin, a traditional gauge of market power; the other component is percent of premiums spent on administrative expenses. We use data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (2001-2009) to evaluate whether the MLR is a good target measure for regulation by comparing the two components of the price-cost margin between markets that are more competitive versus those that are not, accounting for firm and market characteristics. We find that insurers with monopoly power have lower MLRs. Moreover, we find no evidence suggesting that insurers' administrative expenses are lower in more concentrated insurance markets. Thus, our results are largely consistent with the interpretation that the MLR could serve as a target measure of market power in regulating the individual market for health insurance but with notable limited ability to capture product and firm heterogeneity.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24123608/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      This paper identifies key methodological issues for economic analyses of costs and effectiveness of Assistive Technology (AT) systems based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Following the biopsychosocial model of the ICF, the paper explores the consequences for cost-effectiveness analyses of AT systems when a user centred approach is taken. In so doing, the paper questions the fiction of neutrality in economic analyses and discusses the distinction between weak and strong objectivity.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Costs are measured as all resources used when providing a particular level of environmental facilitators and reducing environmental barriers for an AT user, while effectiveness is measured in terms of the resulting increase in activities and participation of the AT user. The ICF's fourth qualifier for activities and participation, which denotes performance without assistance is used to identify the additional performance achieved due to the particular environmental factors in the current situation (first qualifier). A fifth qualifier for activities and participation is introduced to denote performance with optimal assistance, and the fourth qualifier is then again used to identify the increase in activities and participation due to the environmental factors in the situation with optimal assistance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The effectiveness that an AT user achieves in his or her current situation can be compared with the effectiveness he or she could achieve when provided with what is considered an optimal AT system based on current technologies and user priorities. This comparison throws into sharp relief the role of AT systems as well as of universal design (UD) in reducing environmental barriers for AT users in a way that is cost-effective for society as a whole.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Cost-effectiveness analysis based on the ICF can provide powerful economic evidence for how best to allocate existing funding for AT systems. We can identify three particular scenarios in which clear recommendations can be made. In addition, cost-effectiveness analysis provides a means to identify how society can comply with its obligation towards all its members in the most cost-effective way, using a combination of AT and UD.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09638280701800293,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18484387/,economics
"Do economic theories that underlie discounting have specific implications for program evaluation in health? In this study, both the contemporary practice and the theoretical foundations of discounting are reviewed. The social discount rate controversy is considered, and the two major concepts (i.e., opportunity cost and time preference) involved in the formulation of a social discount rate are outlined. Also described are the arguments for discounting proposed by thinkers in non-economic disciplines. Finally, the implications of choosing a discount rate for evaluation of individual health care programs are considered. It is argued that the conventional practice of discounting all health care programs at a rate of 5% may not consistently reflect societal or individual preference. Specific recommendations arising from this paper are: 1) given the considerable disagreement at the theoretical level as to the appropriate social discount rate, analysts should be specific about what theoretical approach underlies their choice of rate, especially when the analytic result is sensitive to the discount rate; 2) the discount rate chosen should be appropriate for the perspective of the analysis (social vs. individual vs. institutional, etc.); 3) when appropriate, measures should be taken to avoid double discounting, because some health related outcome measures already incorporate individuals' time preference; and 4) it is suggested that the political process may serve as the appropriate means of reflecting social values in the choice of a discount rate. In addition, the authors argue that a consensus conference approach, with political participation, offers a flexible, pragmatic, and explicit way of synthesizing the empirical, normative, and ethical considerations that underlie choice of a discount rate.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-199305000-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8501989/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      We sought to explore to what extent the use of Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) may help to identify efficient treatment allocation strategy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The analysis was based on data from the COACH study, in which 1023 patients with heart failure were randomly assigned to three treatments: care-as-usual, basic support, and intensive support. First, using predicted 18-month mortality risk as the stratification basis, a suitable strategy for assigning different treatments to different risk groups of patients was developed. To that end, a graphical exploration of the difference in net monetary benefit (NMB) across treatment regimens and baseline risk was used. Next, the efficiency gains resulting from this proposed subgroup strategy were quantified by computing the difference in NMB between our stratified approach and the best performing population-wide strategy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The analysis using STEPPs suggested that a differentiated approach, based on offering intensive support to low-risk patients (18-month mortality risk ≤ 0.16) and basic support to intermediate- to high-risk patients (18-month mortality risk > 0.16) would be an economically efficient treatment allocation strategy. This was confirmed in the subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis, where the average gain in NMB resulting from the proposed stratified approach compared to basic support for all was found to be €1312 (95% CI €390-€2346) per patient.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      STEPP provides a systematic approach to assess the interaction between baseline risk and the difference in NMB between competing interventions and to identify cutoffs to stratify patients in a health economically optimal manner.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-018-1013-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374630/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Donor engagement in transitional settings, complex emergencies and fragile states is increasing. Neither short-term humanitarian aid nor traditional development financing are well adapted for such environments. Multi-donor trust funds, in their current form, can be unwieldy and subject to long delays in initiation and work best when national governments are already strong. We reviewed the aid modalities used in Zimbabwe through the period of crisis, 2008-2012 and their results and implications. Literature review and case experience was utilised.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      By focusing on working with line ministries in non-contested sectors to determine local priorities rather than following global prescriptions, pooling funds to achieve scale rather than delivering through fragmented projects, and building on national systems and capacities rather than setting up parallel mechanisms, the Transition Fund Model employed in Zimbabwe by UNICEF and partners in partnership with the Inclusive Government was able to achieve important results in health, education, social support and water services in a challenging setting. In addition, forums for collaboration were developed that provided a platform for further action. The initial emphasis on service delivery diffused much of the political delicateness that impeded progress in other sectors. The Zimbabwean experience may provide a model of innovative financing for countries facing similar circumstances. Such models may represent a new practical application of the Paris Principles, consistent with the major tenets of the 2011 New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States agreed in Busan. As we approach the Millennium Development Goal deadline, an over-arching, mutli-sectoral and independent evaluation of this approach is recommended in order to validate findings and assess broader replicability of this approach.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12914-014-0035-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25494877/,economics
"Background and scope:
        
      
      This article discusses health economic challenges of research and development, registration, pricing and reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars. A literature search was carried out of PubMed, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and EconLit up to March 2009.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The development process of biopharmaceuticals is risky, lengthy, complex and expensive. Registration is complicated by the inherent variation between biopharmaceuticals. Also, as biopharmaceuticals are likely to be efficacious in a subgroup of the patient population, there is a need to select the most responsive target population and to identify biomarkers. To inform pricing and reimbursement decisions, the development process needs to collect comparative data to calculate the incremental cost effectiveness and budget impact of biopharmaceuticals. There is a role for innovative mechanisms such as risk-sharing arrangements to reimburse biopharmaceuticals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Given that biosimilars are similar, but not identical to the reference biopharmaceutical, the development process needs to generate clinical trial data in order to gain marketing authorisation. From a health economic perspective, the question arises whether inherent differences between biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars produce differences in safety, effectiveness and costs: to date, this question is unresolved. The early inclusion of health economics in the process of developing biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars is imperative with a view to demonstrating their relative (cost) effectiveness and informing registration, pricing and reimbursement decisions.",https://doi.org/10.3111/13696990903260094,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723019/,economics
"The New Federalism that evolved under the Reagan administration tends to grant states more discretion in the implementation of health care programs. It thereby rekindles old concerns about the commitment, capacity, and progressivity of the states. This paper reviews recent policy developments and reconsiders state performance from the vantage point of the mid-1980s. While hard evidence remains elusive, a plausible case exists that any gap between the states and Washington on commitment, capacity, and progressivity has diminished. State administrative capacity in particular has probably increased. The continued presence of substantial variation among the states needs to be underscored, however. Moreover, the relentless imperative of economic development, or migration, theory sets severe limits on how far states can go in adopting redistributive measures to assure adequate medical care for the poor. Given current federal laws, the most optimistic, plausible scenario envisions the rise of a technical politics of efficiency in the states.

"The results of a survey of 71 directors of community mental health centers in 15 states in 1982 and 1983 indicate that CMHCs made major changes in their services, staffing, sources of revenue, administration, and organization to cope with shrinking budgets, increased state regulation, impending prospective payment systems, and accelerating competition from private for-profit health care providers. Services offered by the CMHCs became less comprehensive and more oriented toward chronic and severely ill patients in 1982 and 1983, and entrepreneurial principles were employed to increase efficiency and attract new sources of revenue. These strategies have been successful, but the authors believe more long-range planning is necessary if CMHCs are to retain their distinctive place in the health care system.",https://doi.org/10.1176/ps.36.11.1169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4065840/,economics
"This article reviews the change in the reimbursement and pricing system in South Korea, which was the precursor to the eventual implementation of evidence-based decision-making. There has been pressure on Korea's National Health Insurance system to control its skyrocketing expenditures on drugs. As a result, a series of cost-containment policies have been implemented. The idea of economic evidence-based decision-making was first introduced in Korea in 2001 when the government announced cost-effectiveness as one of the criteria for reimbursement decisions. After this announcement, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) developed guidelines, which became the standard for economic evaluations. In 2006, the drug listing system for reimbursement was changed from a negative to a positive system under the drug expenditure rationalization plan. Under this new system, only drugs that are proven economically and clinically valuable can be listed, and applicants have to submit economic evaluation studies to support the cost-effectiveness of their drugs. Once new applications are submitted, HIRA reviews them, and the Drug Reimbursement Evaluation Committee (DREC) decides whether or not to recommend the submitted drugs. In its reimbursement decisions, the DREC considers not only cost-effectiveness but also the availability of therapeutic alternatives, the severity of the condition treated, and the impact on the budget, among other measures. After the introduction of the positive list system, 56% of drugs were determined to be appropriate for reimbursement by the DREC. Despite limited human resources, experience, and quality local data, Korea is continuing to make efforts to establish a system of evidence-based decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00625.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20586979/,economics

"Both healthcare professionals and the healthcare system must defend each patient's health individually while simultaneously seeking to protect the population's health in general. Nowadays, there is an important increase in the cost of healthcare supply, mainly due to the developments of medical science, the public's expectations and the demographic ageing. Since healthcare resources are not unlimited, it is obvious that immoderate consumption of them by certain patients limits the use of the same funds by others. Therefore, we have to seek an optimal distribution of the existing resources in order to manage a constriction of expenses, especially under the circumstances of the modern economic crisis.

Both the individual state-based method and the recent panel data method are applied. Allowing for structural breaks in the test, we find that health care expenditures and GSP are both nonstationary. The evidence also suggests that the two series form a cointegrating relationship. The income elasticities of health spending vary over states and became smaller in the 1990s.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1182,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17039571/,economics
"Interest in technical aids is growing. Occupational therapists are beginning to play a role in this area. Four programs in which occupational therapists are involved in Canada are described. The programs are: 1. a province-wide, private agency supported program 2. a university based research project funded by a provincial government 3. a technical aids component of the rehabilitation program at a Regional Rehabilitation Centre. 4. a private consulting business. The economic implications of each program are examined to determine whether the program can be justified economically and whether the occupational therapist can justify economically, adding involvement with technical aids to their existing role.",https://doi.org/10.1177/000841747804500304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10316701/,economics
"In this study we estimated the costs of back pain to society in The Netherlands in 1991 to be 1.7% of the GNP. The results also show that musculoskeletal diseases are the fifth most expensive disease category regarding hospital care, and the most expensive regarding work absenteeism and disablement. One-third of the hospital care costs and one-half of the costs of absenteeism and disablement due to musculoskeletal disease were due to back pain. The total direct medical costs of back pain were estimated at US$367.6 million. The total costs of hospital care due to back pain constituted the largest part of the direct medical costs and were estimated at US$200 million. The mean costs of hospital care for back pain per case were US$3856 for an inpatient and US$199 for an outpatient. The total indirect costs of back pain for the entire labour force in The Netherlands in 1991 were estimated at US$4.6 billion; US$3.1 billion was due to absenteeism and US$1.5 billion to disablement. The mean costs per case of absenteeism and disablement due to back pain were US$4622 and US$9493, respectively. The indirect costs constituted 93% of the total costs of back pain, the direct medical costs contributed only 7%. It is therefore concluded that back pain is not only a major medical problem but also a major economical problem.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3959(94)00272-g,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8545149/,economics
"We introduce a new source of detailed data on spending by medical condition to analyze US health care spending growth in the period 2000-14. We found that thirty conditions, which represented only 11.5 percent of all conditions studied, accounted for 42 percent of the real growth rate in per capita spending during this period, even though they accounted for only 13 percent of overall spending in 2000. Primary drivers of spending growth included the use of new technologies, a shift toward the provision of preventive-type services, and an aging and more obese population. The health benefits of many new technologies appeared to outweigh the associated expenditures on treatment, which indicates that these are cost-effective and provide a net value to society. However, while these technologies may be of value, new treatments are often more expensive than older ones.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1688,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29863919/,economics
"The Healthcare Educational and Research Foundation (HERF) in Minneapolis undertook a two-year research project to study the effects of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and competition on the hospital industry in Minneapolis/St. Paul. This article summarizes HERF's major findings surrounding three key questions: (1) do the HMOs in Minneapolis/St. Paul use fewer hospital resources relative to conventional payers?; (2) do recent overall community trends in inpatient use suggest evidence of hospital utilization-reducing effects attributable to HMOs?; and (3) given the highly visible competitive process among Minneapolis/St. Paul providers, do hospital cost and revenue data suggest any evidence of cost-containment? The findings (based on data through 1982) indicate that for comparable patients, Twin Cities HMOs appear to use fewer medical care resources per hospitalized patient. There was, however, no clear evidence of community-wide, utilization-reducing effects directly attributable to the ""competitive effect"" of HMO introduction and development in the market. In addition, there was no empirical evidence that HMOs (which had enrolled 25 percent of the consumer market by 1982), or other large buyers of inpatient services, have selected hospitals on the basis of price as hypothesized by competition advocates.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-10-4-659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3701008/,economics

Although some global cost estimates can be made, little is known about the cost implications of parental burden.

"Simple income-based incentives to purchase health insurance (tax credits or deductions, or subsidies) are unlikely to succeed in significantly reducing the number of uninsured because income is not a good predictor of the extent to which individuals use medical service. Proposals to provide incentives to low-income people so they will purchase individual health insurance need to address the inherent tension between the interests of low-risk and high-risk people who rely on individual coverage. If carriers are forced to cover all applicants and to community rate premiums, low-risk people will drop coverage or not apply for it because premiums will exceed their expected need for insurance. Concern for people who currently have access to individual coverage calls for careful examination of options to permit incentive programs to succeed with the individual insurance markets. In particular, attention should focus on using alternatives to simple income-based subsidies to spread the burden of high-risk people's costs broadly, rather than impose the costs on low-risk people who purchase individual coverage. This paper describes three such alternatives. One uses risk adjustments and two rely on reinsurance so that carriers are compensated for the higher costs of covering high-risk people who use incentives to buy insurance. One alternative also permits risk selection by insurance carriers.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_38.2.133,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11529511/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To propose a set of guidelines for use by health care organizations in the United States that seek useful, comparative clinical information and economic analysis on pharmaceutical products to make sound drug purchasing decisions.
    


          Practice innovation:
        
      
      Based on a therapy intervention approach, the guidelines provide a structured framework to help managed care purchasers become more consistent in how they evaluate drug products for inclusion in the formulary. The guidelines factor in the need to examine the impact of new drug products on overall costs within the entire health system.
    


          Practice setting:

      The guidelines provide MCOs with a new systematic approach for identifying the overall cost and clinical outcomes impact of drug therapies. The guidelines are designed to take into account the characteristics of the patient population being treated and the fact that patients generally are redistributed among different treatment categories once a new drug product is introduced, thus offering MCOs an analysis model that extends beyond the traditional partial cost-outcomes approach. Emphasis is placed on looking at the cost-outomes impact of a new drug or therapy within a systems or disease area framework in which the redistribution of patients between therapy options is explicitly modelled. The guidelines specify that the following information elements be used in pharmacoeonomic analysis: product description, place in therapy, comparator products, therapy intervention framework, supporting clinical data, supporting pharmacoeconomic data, system impact assessments-costs-outcomes, overall assessment, and bibliography and supporting materials.",https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2020.26.6.689,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32463775/,economics

These acts, it is claimed, are part of economical instrumental reason restructuring itself by using experiences as tools in convincing consumers that they are free to pursue their respective paths of lives.

"This paper adds to the growing literature of cryptocurrency and behavioral finance. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between the novel investor attention and financial characteristics of Bitcoin, i.e., return and realized volatility, which are the two most important characteristics of one certain asset. Our empirical results show supports in the behavior finance area and argue that investor attention is the granger cause to changes in Bitcoin market both in return and realized volatility. Moreover, we make in-depth investigations by exploring the linear and non-linear connections of investor attention on Bitcoin. The results indeed demonstrate that investor attention shows sophisticated impacts on return and realized volatility of Bitcoin. Furthermore, we conduct one basic and several long horizons out-of-sample forecasts to explore the predictive ability of investor attention. The results show that compared with the traditional historical average benchmark model in forecasting technologies, investor attention improves prediction accuracy in Bitcoin return. Finally, we build economic portfolios based on investor attention and argue that investor attention can further generate significant economic values.

"Cost-benefit analysis is probably the most comprehensive method of economic evaluation available and it can be applied in two ways. The human capital approach means that the value of people's contributions is linked to what they are paid. The approach based on individuals' observed or stated preference means that their personal valuations are placed on an activity by assessing how much money they are prepared to accept for an increased risk or to pay for a particular service. Each method has its disadvantages and the most successful that has been devised so far is the ""willingness to pay"" (stated preference) approach, though the response to this is to a large extent dependent on the income of the person being questioned. There are still problems with its application, however, so its usefulness is limited.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.307.6909.924,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8241859/,economics
"Drugs are becoming a particular target for health care cost containment measures, as part of the increasing pressure to improve the value for money from the use of health care resources. This has led to an exponential growth in the number of economic evaluations of pharmaceuticals, many of which have been funded by pharmaceutical companies. A review of the existing literature on economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals was conducted in order to classify studies and to document their results. The review identified 85 evaluations, published between 1986 and 1991, that were suitable for analysis. In most published studies it was found that in the treatment or prevention of a disease, a drug intervention was more cost-effective than no intervention and, in a number of cases, drug interventions were at least as cost-effective as other forms of intervention. In evaluating the published evidence it is important to note that positive studies are more likely to be published and that the quality of study methods varies. However, the studies can be of use to policy makers with an interest in securing more value for money, although economic assessments should be applied equally to all health technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(93)90078-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10130847/,economics
"Most nations are predominately preoccupied with the need to increase economic growth amidst pressure for increased energy consumption. However, higher energy consumption from fossil fuel has its environmental implication(s) especially in a high industrial economy like China. In this context, the current study explores the interaction between pollutant emission, foreign direct investment, energy consumption, tourism arrival, and economic growth for quarterly frequency data from 1995Q1 to 2016Q4 for econometrics analysis. Pesaran's autoregressive distributed lag-bound test traces long-run relationship between all outlined variables over the investigated period. Empirical results show positive relationship between pollutant emissions with all other variables with the exception of economic growth. This further exposes the environmental degradation in China with the curtailing strength from the GDP. The Granger causality analysis detects that CO2 emissions and energy consumption show a two-way causality observed. Also, one-way causality existing between growth and foreign direct investment is seen running to pollutant emission. Furthermore, one-way causality is observed among foreign direct investment, energy consumption, pollutant emission, and tourism arrivals with economic growth, and this established their impact on the economic growth which will be a guide to the policy implication on how to ameliorate environmental degradation from the effect of consumption of fossil energy sources and foreign direct investment-induced pollutant emission.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08180-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32162224/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Gender is one of the best-established differences in risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia, with women being at greater risk. However, the financial implications are unknown. This study aims at understanding the economic burden of AD by gender.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This study takes a life-time perspective to investigate the burden of AD over the course of the disease. Nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data were used to estimate the course of illness of AD from age 65 to death and the incremental costs of AD on Medicare and Medicaid. Published data on the use and costs of assisted living facilities, home health care, and informal care were imputed into the course of illness to calculate the lifetime costs of these services.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Females and males have distinctively different patterns of course of illness of AD. Women face higher risks of having AD (15.5% vs. 13.1%) and of serving as informal caregivers for AD patients (6.8% vs. 4.0%) before death. Medicare and Medicaid account for major payers of AD care for both genders, but the greatest economic challenge of AD to women is the cost of the informal care they deliver, resulting in women bearing six times the cost of men.

      Public policy interventions that aim at curing or slowing the progress of AD will greatly benefit the welfare and economic status of women.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2015.06.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26363924/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The U.K. NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) project is commissioned to identify papers on economic evaluations of health technologies and to disseminate their findings to NHS decision makers by means of structured abstracts that are available through a public database and the Cochrane Library. This paper discusses current issues relating to the economic aspects of producing NHS EED abstracts.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A review of NHS EED was undertaken between 1994 and 1999 to determine the methodologies adopted and issues that influence the usefulness of economic evaluations. Methods adopted to improve the quality of NHS EED abstracts are also reported.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighty-five percent of NHS EED abstracts are cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), 9.3% are cost-utility analyses (CUAs), and only 1.4% are cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). Of the total abstracts, 65.9% are based on single studies, 19.5% on reviews, 3.9% on estimates of effectiveness, and 10.7% on combinations of these sources. Models are utilized in 16.7% of CEAs, 60.2% of CUAs, and 20% of CBAs. Analyses of CBA studies reveal a degree of misuse of well-established definitions. NHS EED internal control mechanisms are reported that provide a means of ensuring that abstracts are based on sound academic principles.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most economic evaluations are conducted by means of CEA, followed by CUA, while CBA accounts for an extreme minority of cases.

"Formal economic evaluation is playing an increasingly important role in health-care decision-making. This is shown by the requirement to present economic data to support applications for public reimbursement for new pharmaceuticals in Australia and the provinces of Canada, and by the appraisal process initiated by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the U.K. This growing role of economic analysis applies as much to the field of asthma as anywhere. This paper provides a detailed review of applied economic studies in asthma. The review is used to explore a range of methodological issues in the field including the choice of perspective and maximand, whether to use disease-specific or generic measures of outcome and whether decision-makers should receive disaggregated cost and consequence data or results that focus on an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. It is concluded that, given the heterogeneity in decision-makers' objectives and constraints, economic studies should be planned and executed in such a way as to maximize flexibility in how results are presented.",https://doi.org/10.1053/rmed.2002.1474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12735668/,economics
"Scarce resources are a reality in all health care systems. There is a constant challenge to maximize health benefits within the resources available. This is particularly relevant when caring for critically ill patients, given the resource-intensive technologies and medicines used and the highly specialized professionals required. Moreover, given the high acuity of illness, decision makers and health care providers in critical care units must constantly assess the value derived from therapies and resources used. Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative health care interventions in their relative costs (resource use) and effectiveness (health effects). Economic evaluations have been increasingly published in critical care journals and read by clinicians. This article illustrates how the basic principles of health economics can be applied to health care decision making through the use of economic evaluation. We demonstrate how economic evaluation can link medical outcomes, quality of life, and costs in a common index, even for therapies for different medical conditions and with different health outcomes. This article highlights the need for randomized clinical trials and economic evaluations of therapies in critical care medicine for which the effect of the therapy on health outcomes and/or costs are unknown.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2006.02.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16769454/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the relationship between economic activities, insurance mandates, and the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in the United States.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We examined the correlation between the coincident index (a proxy for overall economic conditions) and IVF use at the national level from 2000 to 2011. We then analyzed the relationship at the state level through longitudinal regression models. The base model tested the correlation at the state level. Additional models examined whether this relationship was affected, both separately and jointly, by insurance mandates and the Great Recession.
    


          Setting:

      The coincident index was positively correlated with IVF use at the national level (correlation coefficient = 0.89). At the state level, an increase of one unit in the coincident index was associated with an increase of 16 IVF cycles per 1 million women, with a significantly greater increase in IVF use in states with insurance mandates than in states without mandates (27 versus 15 IVF cycles per 1 million women). The Great Recession did not alter the relationship between the coincident index and IVF use.
    


          Conclusion(s):

"Objective:
        
      
      To provide a comparison of national drug reimbursement decision-making, including an update of economic evaluation roles and barriers, in Thailand, China, and South Korea.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Documentary reviews supplemented by experiences of policymakers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      National health insurance policy in all the three countries has been developed toward coverage for all. It leads to higher health-care expenditures and requires a good reimbursement system for health-care services, including drugs. Drug reimbursement decision-making in these countries is to develop a reimbursement list with the help of various committees having different roles. Primarily, they assess the clinical and safety evidence. Economic evidence, including budget impact and pharmacoeconomic evaluation, has also been very important for their reimbursement decision-making. This evidence is sometimes used in negotiation mechanism, which allows pharmaceutical companies to lower their drug prices and leads to lower overall drug expenditures. Several common barriers, for example, human capacity and data availability, for obtaining economic evidence in all the three countries, however, still exist.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Drug reimbursement decision-making in Thailand, China, and South Korea is in its transition period. It seems to run in the same direction, for example, guideline development and pharmacoeconomic evaluation agency establishment. Pharmacoeconomic evaluation plays important roles in the efficiency of drug reimbursement decision-making, even though there are several barriers to be overcome.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22265058/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Payers and purchasers in the United States seek to moderate drug prices and align them with the incremental clinical benefit offered by individual medications; some policymakers have proposed linking U.S. prices to an index of prices paid in other nations. The German health care system resembles that of the United States in featuring multiple private payers but differs in featuring a highly coordinated process of comparative clinical assessment and price negotiations for drugs.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To (a) measure trends in prices paid for physician-administered drugs in Germany before and after the mandate for comparative effectiveness assessment and price negotiations in 2011 and (b) compare them with price trends for the same drugs in the United States.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study observed trends in the prices paid for 80 physician-administered drugs, which account for approximately half of Medicare Part B drug spending. Quarterly data covering 2004-2018 were obtained for Germany from the Lauer-Taxe database, which contains net prices paid by all German payers. U.S. data were obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which publishes net prices paid by private U.S. payers and the Medicare Part B program. These data contain the net prices actually paid after accounting for all discounts and rebates, not merely the manufacturer's list price. Statistical analyses were conducted with multivariable difference-in-differences regression methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Before implementation in Germany of comparative effectiveness analysis and collective price negotiations, net U.S. prices for physician-administered drugs averaged 29.2% higher (95% CI = 26.6%-31.7) than those in Germany. After implementation of comparative effectiveness assessments and price negotiations in 2011, the divergence between U.S. and German prices increased another 28.9% (95% CI = 23.7%-34.3%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Commercial health insurers and Medicare pay significantly higher net prices for physician-administered drugs than do insurers in Germany, with the divergence growing after the mandate in Germany that new drugs be subject to comparative effectiveness assessment and collective price negotiations. The experience of Germany may be of special value for the current U.S. debate over pharmaceutical pricing reform, given the demographic, economic, and health system similarities between the 2 nations.

          Study design:
        
      
      Regression models examined whether hospitals' advertising spending predicts HCAHPS global measures and whether market concentration moderated this association.
    


          Data collection/extraction methods:
        
      
      Hospital advertising spending was calculated by adding each individual hospital's expenditures to the amount spent by its parent health system, proportionally allocated by hospital revenue. Health system market share was used to estimate market concentration. These data were compared to hospitals' HCAHPS measures.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      In competitive markets (HHI below 1,000), hospital advertising predicted HCAHPS global measures. A 1-percent increase in advertising was associated with a 1.173-percent increase in patients rating the hospital a ""9"" or ""10"" on the HCAHPS survey and a 1.540-percent increase in patients who ""definitely"" would recommend the hospital. In concentrated markets, this association was not significant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In competitive markets, hospitals that spend more on advertising earn higher HCAHPS ratings on global measures.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.12549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546176/,economics
"With new modeling techniques for estimating and pricing the risks of natural disasters, the donor community is now in a position to help the poor cope with the economic repercussions of disasters by assisting before they happen. Such assistance is possible with the advent of novel insurance instruments for transferring catastrophe risks to the global financial markets. Donor-supported risk-transfer programs not only would leverage limited disaster-aid budgets but also would free recipient countries from depending on the vagaries of postdisaster assistance. Both donors and recipients stand to gain, especially because the instruments can be closely coupled with preventive measures.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1116783,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16099976/,economics
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality and consumes substantial health-care resources, particularly when renal replacement therapy is required. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not identified the optimal mode of renal replacement for AKI in terms of clinically relevant endpoints such as patient survival or recovery of renal function. As for other complex health interventions, the costs and consequences of AKI treatment are relevant to health-care providers and decision makers aiming to maximize health outcomes despite fixed health resources. Studies from several different centers suggest that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is more costly than intermittent hemodialysis and less economically attractive than even intensive intermittent dialysis. On the other hand, while the incremental costs of providing CRRT are significant, they remain relatively small compared with the projected costs of providing chronic dialysis to survivors who do not recover renal function. Even small differences in the risk of chronic dialysis in survivors are likely to determine the economic attractiveness of the different types of renal replacement therapies. To clarify the true incremental cost-effectiveness of these therapies, future RCTs should collect data on long-term survival, the need for chronic dialysis, and detailed information on costs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-139x.2011.00836.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21517991/,economics
"Under the Affordable Care Act, preventive care measures, including vaccinations and screenings, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the US Preventive Services Task Force must be covered in full by insurance. These recommendations affect the cost of medical care. Yet neither organization explicitly incorporates measures of efficiency or cost-effectiveness in making its recommendations. To redress this shortcoming, we propose a decision-making framework for these two organizations based on the principles of economic efficiency. Our analysis suggests that routine use of a preventive service should be recommended for full insurance coverage if the service's cost-effectiveness exceeds a socially determined threshold. For less cost-effective services, we suggest that information about effectiveness and cost should be provided to consumers by physicians or government, but the choice of care and insurance coverage for care should be made by individuals. For the least cost-effective services, the two organizations should discourage public and private insurers from covering such services and report their unfavorable cost-effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25368000/,economics
"Spillover effects on the welfare of family members may refer to caregiver health effects, informal care time costs, or both. This review focuses on methods that have been used to measure and value informal care time and makes suggestions for their appropriate use in cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness analyses. It highlights the importance of methods to value informal care time that are independent of caregiver health effects in order to minimize double counting of spillover effects. Although the concept of including caregiver time costs in economic evaluations is not new, relatively few societal perspective cost-effectiveness analyses have included informal care, with the exception of dementia. This is due in part to challenges in measuring and valuing time costs. Analysts can collect information on time spent in informal care or can assess its impact in displacing other time use, notably time in paid employment. A key challenge is to ensure appropriate comparison groups that do not require informal care to be able to correctly estimate attributable informal care time or foregone market work. To value informal care time, analysts can use estimates of hourly earnings in either opportunity cost or replacement cost approaches. Researchers have used widely varying estimates of hourly earnings. Alternatively, stated-preference methods (i.e. contingent valuation, conjoint analysis) can be used to value the effect of informal care on utility, but this can entail double counting with health effects. Lack of consensus and standardization of methods makes it difficult to compare estimates of informal care costs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00782-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30953263/,economics
"The risks of a less than optimum provision of drugs are shared between patients, medical staff, health insurances and the society as a whole. Often, though, they are unavoidable, sometimes due to legal constraints. Taking multiple myeloma, iron deficiency, and macula degeneration as examples it will be demonstrated that the optimal supply with drugs frequently involving off-label and not reimbursable drugs - cannot only benefit the patient, but can also be cost-saving for the health insurances. The most recent endeavours by the German government to restrain drug expenditures have remained ineffective. Nonetheless, it is expected from patients and physicians alike to bear an ever-increasing share of the health care costs. This problem has no universal solution. Common efforts of all participants in health care are necessary to find a way to evade the explosion of health care costs and to ensure continuous funding of drugs. It is important, however, that patients not be denied access to (often life-lengthening) drugs because of legal ramifications.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2008.09.022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19213456/,economics

"Since climate change is the paramount concern of recent literature, macroeconomic factors such as green growth and economic globalization may play an integral role in achieving ecological sustainability in the presence of eco-innovation. However, the combined contributions of green growth, economic globalization, and eco-innovation towards achieving ecological sustainability are missing from the existing knowledge. Therefore, we investigate the combined influence of these variables in the presence of human capital, financial development, and gross domestic product on ecological footprint per capita for a panel of 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1990 through 2017. The method of panel quantile regression is used to produce sound results across varying levels of the ecological footprint of OECD nations. The main results are as follows: firstly, green productivity growth linearly and non-linearly mitigates the ecological degradation, presenting a more pronounced ecological protection impact for higher quantiles, followed by medium and lower quantiles. Secondly, economic globalization manifests mixed effects: it induces ecological deterioration impact in the absence of its interaction with eco-innovation, while it brings about an ecological protection impact with the interaction term. Thirdly, eco-innovation demonstrates an ecological protection impact for all quantiles, with the most influential impact in countries with higher ecological footprint per capita, followed by medium and lower footprints. Based on empirical results, we propose productive utilization of environmental resources for ecological sustainability through product and process innovation and efficient management practices. Besides, we recommend cultivating energy-efficient and clean environmental technologies for long-term ecological sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113980,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34689028/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Psoriasis is associated with significant economic burdens. Data regarding costs for psoriasis patients in Taiwan are not available.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the economic burden of psoriasis in Taiwan.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Psoriasis patients and their controls were identified from the 2006 National Health Insurance (NHI) research database, and differences in annual healthcare utilization and costs between psoriasis cases and controls were predicted by two-part models and generalized linear models. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in five hospital settings to collect information on out-of-pocket payments and productivity losses associated with seeking care. All analyses were stratified by the severity level of psoriasis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From the payer's perspective, the NHI cost associated with moderate to severe psoriasis (sPsO) was NT$41,525 and that with mild psoriasis (mPsO) was NT$14,816. Adding the out-of-pocket payments (NT$13,095 for sPsO and NT$7237 for mPsO) and the loss of productivity (NT$6203 for sPsO and NT$2750 for mPsO), the annual total cost for sPsO was NT$60,823 and that for mPsO was NT$24,803.

The findings highlight difficulties in establishing accurate estimates of spending on public health, but also point to cutbacks in many countries and an overall declining share of health expenditure going to public health.

"Background:
        
      
      In the Netherlands, decisions about the reimbursement of new pharmaceuticals are based on cost effectiveness, as well as therapeutic value and budget impact. Since 1 January 2005, drug manufacturers are formally required to substantiate the cost effectiveness of drugs that have therapeutic added value in comparison with existing ones through pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Dutch guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research provide methods guidance, ensuring consistency in both the evidence and the decision-making process about drug reimbursement.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      This study reviewed the methodological quality of all 21 formally required pharmacoeconomic evaluations of new pharmaceuticals between 1 January 2005 and 1 October 2008, and verified whether these evaluations complied with pharmacoeconomic guidelines.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data on the quality of the pharmacoeconomic evaluations were extracted from the pharmacoeconomic reports published by the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ). The Board's newsletters provided information on the advice to, and reimbursement decisions made by, the Dutch Minister of Health. All data extraction was carried out by two independent reviewers, and descriptive analyses were conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The methodological quality was sound in only 8 of the 21 pharmacoeconomic evaluations. In most cases, the perspective of analysis, the comparator drugs, and the reporting of both total and incremental costs and effects were correct. However, drug indication, form (i.e. cost utility/cost effectiveness) and time horizon of the evaluations were frequently flawed. Moreover, the costs and effects of the pharmaceuticals were not always analysed correctly, and modelling studies were often non-transparent. Twelve drugs were reimbursed, and nine were not.
    


          Conclusions:

This would improve the methodological quality of the pharmacoeconomic evaluations and ensure consistency in the evidence and the decision-making process for drug reimbursement in the Netherlands.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11539850-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22074610/,economics
"In economic evaluation of health care, main stream practice is to discount benefits at the same rate as costs. But main papers in which this practice is advocated have missed a distinction between two quite different evaluation problems: (1) How much does the time of program occurrence matter for value and (2) how much do delays in health benefits from programs implemented at a given time matter? The papers have furthermore focused on logical and arithmetic arguments rather than on real value considerations. These 'consistency arguments' are at best trivial, at worst logically flawed. At the end of the day, there is a sensible argument for equal discounting of costs and benefits rooted in microeconomic theory of rational, utility maximising consumers' saving behaviour. But even this argument is problematic, first because the model is not clearly supported by empirical observations of individuals' time preferences for health, second because it relates only to evaluation in terms of overall individual utility.

"Context:
        
      
      Independent practice associations (IPAs) are developing new methods of physician reimbursement to balance the objectives of encouraging individual productivity and clinical cooperation. The economic literature on payment incentives, derived from nonhealth industries, predicts that methods blending elements of fee-for-service and capitation will outperform exclusive reliance on either form of payment.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To identify emerging payment methods within IPA physician groups that contract with managed care organizations.
    


          Design and setting:
        
      
      Case studies of 7 large IPAs in the San Francisco, Calif, metropolitan region that served 826000 health maintenance organization (HMO) patients during the summer and fall of 1998.
    


          Main outcome measure:
        
      
      Payment methods of IPAs for primary care physicians, specialists, and physicians grouped by specialty department within the overall IPA structure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All the IPAs contracted with multiple HMOs for the full range of primary and specialty care physicians' services but paid member physicians using methods that blended elements of fee-for-service and subcapitation. For primary care, most IPAs used monthly capitation adjusted for patient age, sex, and selected diagnoses, supplemented with fee-for-service payment for a wide range of visits and procedures, including patient visits in subacute, skilled nursing facility, emergency department, or home settings; for preventive care services; for office procedures requiring expensive supplies; and, most importantly, for borderline primary care procedures that either could be performed directly or referred to specialty care. All the IPAs paid specialty departments on a capitated basis and delegated to the departments responsibility for allocating the budget among individuals. Allocation mechanisms for individual specialists included adjusted fee-for-service, referral-based capitation, and blends of both.
    


          Conclusion:

"In recent years, evidence has emerged regarding the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT). Despite growing evidence in this field, there is need for appropriate research designs that effectively reflect the person-centred system of care promoted in osteopathy and provide data which can inform policy decisions within the healthcare system. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify, appraise and synthesise the evidence from comparative effectiveness and economic evaluation research involving OMT. A database search was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, PEDro, AMED, SCOPUS and OSTMED.DR, from their inception to May 2015. Two separate searches were undertaken to identify original research articles encompassing the economic evaluation and comparative effectiveness of OMT. Identified comparative effectives studies were evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and appraised using the Good Reporting of Comparative Effectiveness (GRACE) principles. Identified economic studies were assessed with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines. Sixteen studies reporting the findings of comparative effectiveness (n = 9) and economic evaluation (n = 7) research were included. The comparative effectiveness studies reported outcomes for varied health conditions and the majority (n = 6) demonstrated a high risk of bias. The economic evaluations included a range of analyses and considerable differences in the quality of reporting were evident.

"Background:
        
      
      The cost-effectiveness of heart failure management programs (HF-MPs) is highly variable. We explored intervention and clinical characteristics likely to influence cost outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of economic analyses alongside randomized clinical trials comparing HF-MPs and usual care. Electronic databases were searched for English peer-reviewed articles published between 1990 and 2013.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 511 articles identified, 34 comprising 35 analyses met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen analyses (51%) reported a HF-MP as more effective and less costly; four analyses (11%), and five analyses (14%) also reported they were more effective but with no significant or an increased cost difference, respectively. Alternatively, five analyses (14%) reported no statistically significant difference in effects or costs, and one analysis (3%) reported no statistically significant effect difference but was less costly. Finally, two analyses (6%) reported no statistically significant effect difference but were more costly. Interventions that reduced hospital admissions tended to result in favorable cost outcomes, moderated by increased resource use, intervention cost and/or the durability of the intervention effect. The reporting quality of economic evaluation assessed by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist varied substantially between 5% and 91% (median 45%; 34 articles) of the checklist criteria adequately addressed. Overall, none of the study, patient or intervention characteristics appeared to independently influence the cost-effectiveness of a HF-MP.

      Searches were undertaken in three databases to identify economic evaluations meeting predefined inclusion criteria. Methodological and reporting standards listed in the country-specific guidelines were converted into discrete binary variables to calculate mean adherence scores. Quality appraisal was done using Drummond's checklist. Stratified analysis was undertaken to identify independent variables affecting adherence.

Attempts at determining the costs of treatment varied widely. When the OMERACT filters were applied to the various measures it was felt that discrimination and/or feasibility was a problem for most of the current economic outcome measures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Measures of cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility are currently the gold standard; however, feasibility of such analyses is an issue. Collaboration with health economists to guide future research is highly recommended.",https://doi.org/10.11607/ijp.3405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23998145/,economics
"Scarce resources in healthcare are a fact of life everywhere. Providing optimal healthcare for haemophilia means delivering the best possible clinical outcomes at an acceptable total cost, however that is defined by individual societies. Health economics helps us to do this. So far, economic evaluation has enhanced our understanding of some of the economic implications of haemophilia and has provided some guidance on the way forward to optimize efficient allocation of resources for this condition. Further advances and consensus on evaluation methods and standards for the economics of haemophilia are required, however. This need will continue in the face of new, more sophisticated and therefore more costly haemophilia therapies.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2516.2002.00639.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12010414/,economics
"Health economics is a relatively new discipline, though its antecedents can be traced back to William Petty FRS (1623-1687). In high-income countries, the academic discipline and scientific literature have grown rapidly since the 1960s. In low- and middle-income countries, the growth of health economics has been strongly influenced by trends in health policy, especially among the international and bilateral agencies involved in supporting health sector development. Valuable and influential research has been done in areas such as cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis, financing of healthcare, healthcare provision, and health systems analysis, but there has been insufficient questioning of the relevance of theories and policy recommendations in the rich world literature to the circumstances of poorer countries. Characteristics such as a country's economic structure, strength of political and social institutions, management capacity, and dependence on external agencies, mean that theories and models cannot necessarily be transferred between settings. Recent innovations in the health economics literature on low- and middle-income countries indicate how health economics can be shaped to provide more relevant advice for policy. For this to be taken further, it is critical that such countries develop stronger capacity for health economics within their universities and research institutes, with greater local commitment of funding.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.0451,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25009059/,economics
"Recent health care reforms have introduced prospective payments and have allowed patients to choose their preferred providers. The expected outcome is efficiency in production and an increase in the quality level. The former objective should be obtained by the prospective payment scheme; the latter by the demand mechanism, through the competition between providers. Unfortunately, because of asymmetry of information, patients are unable to observe the true quality and the demand for health care services depends on a perceived quality as influenced by the hospital advertising. Inefficiency in the resource allocation and social welfare loss are the two likely effects. In this paper we show how the purchaser can implement effective policies to overcome these undesired effects.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-007-9027-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17659373/,economics

"During 2003-05, states faced some of the largest budget shortfalls since World War II. With a focus on Medicaid and SCHIP, we examine budget decisions in eight states during this period. Increasing Medicaid enrollment because of the economic down-turn and rising health care costs compounded state budget shortfalls as state revenues dropped; problems peaked in 2004. States, however, were reluctant to confront their budget deficits as long-term problems and implemented a variety of one-time revenue strategies and spending reductions that push fiscal problems into the future. The arrival of federal fiscal relief in late 2003 helped states avoid deeper cuts but did not eliminate cutbacks.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w5.385,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16105853/,economics
"The literature on economic efficiency in providing hospital services has been growing recently. Often such literature examines the costs of providing services at varying volumes of treatments per location per year. However, instead of measuring cost directly, these studies use patient bills (charges) aa a proxy for cost. Charges may bear little resemblance to economic cost, and use of charges as a proxy for economic cost may lead researchers to draw unwarranted conclusions about economic efficiency. Because of the differences between economic cost, accounting cost, and charges to the patient, actual resource consumption should be used as a measure of cost.",https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-96-1-102,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7053682/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The importance of co-morbid diabetes and depression is gaining increased attention. Quantifying the socio-economic and clinical impacts of co-morbidity is important given the high costs of these diseases. This review synthesised evidence on the economic impact of co-morbidity and potential cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      11 databases from 1980 until June 2011 searched. In addition, websites and reference lists of studies scrutinised and hand search of selected journals performed. Reviewers independently assessed abstracts, with economic data extracted from relevant studies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      62 studies were identified. 47 examined the impact of co-morbidity on health care and other resource utilisation. 11 of these included productivity losses, although none quantified the impact of mortality. Most demonstrated an association between co-morbidity and increasing health service utilisation and cost. Adverse impacts on workforce participation and absenteeism were found. 15 economic evaluations were also identified. Most focused on primary care led collaborative and/or stepped care, suggesting actions may be cost effective. We did not identify any studies looking at actions to reduce the risk of diabetes in people with depression.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Most studies are set in the US, which may be due to focus on English language databases. Few studies looked at impacts beyond one year or outside the health care system.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is an evidence base demonstrating the adverse economic impacts of co-morbid diabetes and depression and potential for cost effective intervention. This evidence base might be strengthened through modelling studies on cost effectiveness using different time periods, contexts and settings.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-0327(12)70008-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23062857/,economics
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Organ transplant is a resource-intensive service that has been subjected to increasing scrutiny in this era of cost containment. A detailed understanding of the economic (societal) and financial (transplant provider) implications of organ quality, recipient characteristics, and allocation policy is vital for the transplant professionals.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Prior studies of kidney transplant economics demonstrate significant cost savings achieved by eliminating the need for long-term dialysis. However, transplant providers are experiencing higher financial costs because of changes in recipient characteristics and broader use of marginal organs. Liver transplantation economics are also more challenging because of the severity of illness-based organ allocation. Furthermore, the use of more allografts recovered from donors after cardiac death has been demonstrated to increase costs with minimal benefits. Finally, successful long-term mechanical support devices have fundamentally changed the economic implications of advanced heart failure care.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Although care for end-stage organ failure through transplant is one of the landmark accomplishments of 20th century medicine, maintaining or expanding access to transplant care is threatened by the high cost of care. Novel strategies are vital to reduce the financial burden faced by the centers that transplant high-risk patients and utilize lower quality organs.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0b013e32835f0757,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23449346/,economics
"Stroke results in significant healthcare costs and decreased quality of life. Thoughtful healthcare delivery redesign can help solve this problem through lower-cost, higher-quality care. The dominant fee-for-service reimbursement system may not incentivize delivery systems to invest in new cost-saving delivery innovations. Furthermore, lack of transparency hinder development of new systems of care. However, emerging payment models, including bundled payments and prospective payment, promote adoption of value-based stroke care methods. Both prevention and treatment of stroke offer opportunities to improve value-for-money via adoption of a package of emerging innovations.

"Reference price systems for prescription drugs constitute widely adopted cost containment tools. Under these regimes, patients co-pay a fraction of the difference between a drug's pharmacy retail price and a reference price that is set by the government. Reference prices are either externally (based on drug prices in other countries) or internally (based on domestic drug prices) determined. We study the effects of a change from external to internal reference pricing in Denmark in 2005. We find that the reform led to substantial reductions in retail prices, reference prices and patient co-payments as well as to sizable decreases in overall producer revenues and health care expenditures. The reform induced consumers to substitute away from branded drugs for which we estimate strong preferences. The increase in consumer welfare due to the reform therefore depends on whether or not we take perceived quality differences into account in its calculation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2014.04.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24879578/,economics
"This study assesses organizational and market factors related to high-tech service differentiation in local hospital markets. The sample includes 1704 nonfederal, general acute hospitals in urban counties in the United States. We relate organizational and market factors in 2011 to service differentiation in 2013, using ordinary least squares regression. Data are compiled from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals, Area Resource File, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Results show that hospitals differentiate more services relative to market rivals if they are larger than the rival and if the hospitals are further apart geographically. Hospitals differentiate more services if they are large, teaching, and nonprofit or public and if they face more market competition. Hospitals differentiate fewer services from rivals if they belong to multihospital systems. The findings underscore the pressures that urban hospitals face to offer high-tech services despite the potential of high-tech services to drive hospital costs upward.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0046958019882591,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31672081/,economics
"Increasing life expectancy, the introduction of costly new drugs and contributions from the health fund which do not cover overall costs, all contribute to financial problems for statutory health insurances (SHI) in oncology. Only an evidence-based approach can help to address these problems. In a first step patient-relevant benefits have to be substantiated as a necessary prerequisite for coverage of any treatment by SHIs. For products with no additional benefit compared to established forms of therapy the price will be limited by the established cost-benefit ratio. For products with additional benefits pricing is more difficult. For this situation the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) has developed general methods for the assessment of the relation of benefits to costs. Pricing based on this health economic evaluation is developed using efficiency frontier plots. However, this method is prone to manipulation and needs to be refined. Therapies without comparators, so-called soloists, cannot be priced in this way. New approaches to increase cost efficiency need to be developed in order to ensure the availability of high quality care in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00120-011-2733-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22159704/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Mobile health (mHealth) is often reputed to be cost-effective or cost-saving. Despite optimism, the strength of the evidence supporting this assertion has been limited. In this systematic review the body of evidence related to economic evaluations of mHealth interventions is assessed and summarized.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seven electronic bibliographic databases, grey literature, and relevant references were searched. Eligibility criteria included original articles, comparison of costs and consequences of interventions (one categorized as a primary mHealth intervention or mHealth intervention as a component of other interventions), health and economic outcomes and published in English. Full economic evaluations were appraised using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist and The PRISMA guidelines were followed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Searches identified 5902 results, of which 318 were examined at full text, and 39 were included in this review. The 39 studies spanned 19 countries, most of which were conducted in upper and upper-middle income countries (34, 87.2%). Primary mHealth interventions (35, 89.7%), behavior change communication type interventions (e.g., improve attendance rates, medication adherence) (27, 69.2%), and short messaging system (SMS) as the mHealth function (e.g., used to send reminders, information, provide support, conduct surveys or collect data) (22, 56.4%) were most frequent; the most frequent disease or condition focuses were outpatient clinic attendance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The average percent of CHEERS checklist items reported was 79.6% (range 47.62-100, STD 14.18) and the top quartile reported 91.3-100%. In 29 studies (74.3%), researchers reported that the mHealth intervention was cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost saving at base case.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Findings highlight a growing body of economic evidence for mHealth interventions. Although all studies included a comparison of intervention effectiveness of a health-related outcome and reported economic data, many did not report all recommended economic outcome items and were lacking in comprehensive analysis. The identified economic evaluations varied by disease or condition focus, economic outcome measurements, perspectives, and were distributed unevenly geographically, limiting formal meta-analysis. Further research is needed in low and low-middle income countries and to understand the impact of different mHealth types.

"To overcome the limitations of neoclassical economics, researchers have leveraged tools of statistical physics to build novel theories. The idea was to elucidate the macroscopic features of financial markets from the interaction of its microscopic constituents, the investors. In this framework, the model of the financial agents has been kept separate from that of their interaction. Here, instead, we explore the possibility of letting the interaction topology emerge from the model of the agents' behavior. Then, we investigate how the emerging cobweb of relationship affects the overall market dynamics. To this aim, we leverage tools from complex systems analysis and nonlinear dynamics, and model the network of mutual influence as the output of a dynamical system describing the edge evolution. In this work, the driver of the link evolution is the relative reputation between possibly coupled agents. The reputation is built differently depending on the extent of rationality of the investors. The continuous edge activation or deactivation induces the emergence of leaders and of peculiar network structures, typical of real influence networks. The subsequent impact on the market dynamics is investigated through extensive numerical simulations in selected scenarios populated by partially rational investors.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171891,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28196144/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the impact of rising health insurance premiums on coverage rates.
    


          Data sources & study setting:
        
      
      Our analysis is based on two cohorts of nonelderly Americans residing in 64 large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) surveyed in the Current Population Survey in 1989-1991 and 1998-2000. Measures of premiums are based on data from the Health Insurance Association of America and the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Benefits.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Probit regression and instrumental variable techniques are used to estimate the association between rising local health insurance costs and the falling propensity for individuals to have any health insurance coverage, controlling for a rich array of economic, demographic, and policy covariates.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      More than half of the decline in coverage rates experienced over the 1990s is attributable to the increase in health insurance premiums (2.0 percentage points of the 3.1 percentage point decline). Medicaid expansions led to a 1 percentage point increase in coverage. Changes in economic and demographic factors had little net effect. The number of people uninsured could increase by 1.9-6.3 million in the decade ending 2010 if real, per capita medical costs increase at a rate of 1-3 percentage points, holding all else constant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Initiatives aimed at reducing the number of uninsured must confront the growing pressure on coverage rates generated by rising costs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00409.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16033490/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      An open medical market is supposed to be a promising tool for preserving the meagre resources of the German public health care system. The competition between humane and economic practice induces conflicts which burden physicians as well as patients. To analyse this problem by scientific means, inpatients were interviewed with the help of a standardised protocol.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      During 10 weeks 524 inpatients were interviewed. The structured questionnaire consisted of nine closed-ended questions with multiple-choice answers. Question 3 included a free amendment. The gender ratio was balanced, and the age pattern represented the typical patient collective of our clinic.
    


          Results and conclusion:
        
      
      The majority of patients expect negative changes in their medical service and the social attitude towards patients and physicians due to promoted medical competition. Besides an increasing financial load, losses in trust, self-determination, and therapeutic freedom are expected. Instead a responsible transparency will not be achieved. Patients still judge the economically dominated reforms on the German health care market with scepticism or even hostility. In their point of view future discussions must aim at a more modern attitude towards health economics in order to bridge the schism they perceive between medical competition and humanitarianism.

"Global discussions on universal health coverage (UHC) have focussed attention on the need for increased government funding for health care in many low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this paper is to explore potential targets for government spending on health to progress towards UHC. An explicit target for government expenditure on health care relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is a potentially powerful tool for holding governments to account in progressing to UHC, particularly in the context of UHC's inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals. It is likely to be more influential than the Abuja target, which requires decreases in budget allocations to other sectors and is opposed by finance ministries for undermining their autonomy in making sectoral budget allocation decisions. International Monetary Fund and World Health Organisation data sets were used to analyse the relationship between government health expenditure and proxy indicators for the UHC goals of financial protection and access to quality health care, and triangulated with available country case studies estimating the resource requirements for a universal health system. Our analyses point towards a target of government spending on health of at least 5% of GDP for progressing towards UHC. This can be supplemented by a per capita target of $86 to promote universal access to primary care services in low-income countries.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133116000414,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28332456/,economics
"Although Medicare is a national program, administration of Part B payments to physicians is in the hands of insurance organizations in ten Medicare regions. The carriers follow varying practices in using actual charges within localities as the basis for determining reasonable charges for physicians' services. While some of these practices have already been shown to influence fee levels, reasonable charge determination involves many more whose influence has not been systematically studied. This paper reviews preliminary findings from a study which examines carrier differences in discretionary practices as to specialties, localities and other claims data that may be merged or compared with Medicare data in determining customary and prevailing prices used to set limits on Medicare payments, and other practices reported in an official questionnaire to carriers. The effect on fee levels and other measures of program performance is being studied after taking into account social, economic and health resource variables extracted from the Area Resource File, that are expected to influence local medical prices through the demand for and supply of physicians' services. Dependent variables representing fees are the 50th percentile of the distribution of weighted customary charges of individual physicians in an area and Supplementary Medical Insurance expenditure per enrollee. The preliminary findings in this paper concern discretionary practices, socioeconomic variables and fee distributions.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-197906000-00009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/376967/,economics
"Provider market power is a powerful driver of high health care costs in the United States. Despite decades of antitrust litigation and regulatory interventions, the problem has worsened and threatens to undermine the benefits of market-based policies. A critical but neglected challenge for all health care reform proposals relying on market competition to address costs is finding effective tools to address the extant market power of dominant hospitals, hospital systems, and many specialty physician practices. This article analyzes the principal market-oriented approaches that have been used in the past and proposed for the future. It argues that antitrust law has an important but constrained role to play and has proved to be especially inept in dealing with extant market power. It finds serious deficiencies in the conduct decrees imposed by some courts and in open-ended regulatory regimes such as those established by Certificate of Public Advantage laws. Although not without administrative complications, policies that target providers who possess market power by capping prices may be the most effective means to control costs and retain the benefits of a competitive delivery system.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28874482/,economics
"Studies have shown that factors like trade, urbanization, and economic growth may increase the ecological footprint (EFP) since ecological distortions are mainly human-induced. Therefore, this study explores the effect of economic growth and urbanization on the EFP, accounting for foreign direct investment and trade in Nigeria, using data from 1977 to 2016. This study used the EFP variable as against the CO2 emissions used in the previous studies since the former is a more comprehensive and extensive measure of environmental quality. We apply the novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) simulations for model estimation, the Bayer and Hanck J Time Ser Anal 34: 83-95, (2013) combined cointegration, and the ARDL bounds test for cointegration. Although the results affirmed the presence of long-run relationship among the variables, economic growth deteriorates the environment in the short run, while urbanization exacts no harmful impact. In the long run, FDI and trade deteriorate the environment while economic growth adds to environmental quality. It is recommended that policymakers strengthen the existing environmental regulations to curtail harmful trade and provide rural infrastructures to abate urban anomaly.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11637-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33410031/,economics
"In a context of cost containment and demands for better quality in public health care, payment systems are used as an instrument to promote efficiency improvements in service providers.

The paper also explores the evolution of the efficiency and quality of the hospitals after its implementation using the Malmquist index. Results indicate that hospitals have slightly improved their efficiency, particularly urban hospitals, and these improvements are not significantly related to a negative evolution of quality. However, it is not possible to assert to what extent, improvements are the consequence of the new payment system.

Using annual data from 1995 to 2012, we employ various panel econometric techniques to achieve the study objectives. Given the nature of variables, the paper applies panel autoregressive distributed lag models to estimate the long-run elasticities of energy intensity. The long-run estimates confirm that tourism investments play an essential role in improving energy efficiency across the transportation and residential sectors. Furthermore, the results show that both the foreign direct investment inflows and trade openness also play a considerable role in reducing energy uses across these sectors. Finally, the findings suggest that the tourism investments Granger cause energy efficiency of transportation and residential sectors in the short-run. Given these findings, the paper adds considerable value to the empirical literature and also provides various policy- and practical implications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05315-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31065977/,economics
"With the planned introduction of Diagnosis related groups (DRG) in the German in-patient reimbursement system an economic brake will be put on the hospitals. The upcoming expected growth of the older German population and the ongoing process of better diagnostic and therapeutic procedures leads to a gap between costs and resources in the established health care system. With the introduction of the DRGs starts a process of one payment for one main diagnosis in hospital care. This requires a better resource control and leads to a tightrope walk between medical and economic aspects. The short time consequences result in great efforts of correct coding of diagnoses and procedures, as a survival strategy for surgical departments. More or less are new structures necessary, the development of ""clinical pathways"" and the increase or decrease of capacities will become the main tasks in the next years.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2002-33569,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12200724/,economics
"This paper discusses the politics of anti-inflationary policy in the medical care sector. We first clarify the issue by distinguishing between four different conceptions commonly used when discussing medical inflation. We then present some of the standard solutions to these problems suggested by economists. In the main part of the paper, we analyze the response of the government. We show that the underlying causes for failure in the economic market are likely to exist in the political market as well. In particular, the public good aspect of anti-inflationary policy fails to provide a strong incentive for the consumers of medical care. In contrast, the providers have very powerful incentives in the political market because the benefits of governmental action in this sector greatly affect them. Providers exert great pressure to prevent government policies aimed at reducing medical care expenditures. We present evidence and theory to explicate which sets of circumstances are most conducive to governmental action. We show that the most effective anti-inflationary programs in medical financing are least likely to be implemented and that a dispersed, pluralistic financing structure reduces the government's incentive to curb inflation.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-1-1-69,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/828636/,economics
"Protecting households from high out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for health care is an important health system goal. High OOP payments can push households into poverty and make them vulnerable to catastrophic health expenditures. This study, based in India, aims to: (a) estimate OOP payments for health and related impoverishment across economic groups; (b) decompose OOP payments and relate the contribution of their components to impoverishment; and (c) examine how well recently introduced national insurance schemes meant for the poor are able to provide financial protection. The analysis of nationally representative data from India shows that 3.5% of the population fall below the poverty line and 5% households suffer catastrophic health expenditures. The poverty deepening impact of OOP payments was at a maximum in people below the poverty line in comparison with those above (Rs. 10.45 vs. Rs. 1.50, respectively). Medicines constitute the main share (72%) of total OOP payments. This share reaches 82% for outpatient care, compared with 42% for inpatient care. Removing OOP payments for inpatient care leads to a negligible fall in the poverty headcount ratio and poverty gap. However, if OOP payments for either medicines or outpatient care are removed then only 0.5% people fall into poverty due to spending on health. These findings suggest that insurance schemes which cover only hospital expenses, like those being rolled out nationally in India, will fail to adequately protect the poor against impoverishment due to spending on health. Further, issues related to identifying the poor and their targeting also constrain the scheme's impact. A broader coverage of benefits, to include medicines and outpatient care for the poor and near poor (i.e. those just above the poverty line), is necessary to achieve significant protection from impoverishment.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czr029,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21486910/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      The outpatient pharmaceutical expenditure in developed countries represents a huge percentage of the total health budget, because of that, it is necessary to use tools aimed to control and guarantee an efficient use of these resources. Improving the current construction of the indicator of pharmaceutical expenditure in order to have a more adjusted tool of pharmaceutical expenditure control.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We introduce the concept of ""equivalent patient"" in the standardization of outpatient pharmaceutical expenditure, considering in its design several socio demographic variables in order to supersede the previous model which just considered the ""Co-payment status"" for adjusting the outpatient pharmaceutical expenditure. We considered variables as age, sex, co-payment status and nationality to elaborate the concept of equivalent patient.
    


          Results:
        
      
      By applying the standardization method we obtained 160 groups of consumption with weights from 0,10 to 4,39 equivalent patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We obtained a tool capable of improving the construction of Pharmaceutical Expenditure Indicators, which are essential for the design of measures aimed to stimulate the rational use of drugs. In a micro level of analysis, the new indicator is useful to establish economic incentives aimed to encourage good performance from physicians in the prescription field.",https://doi.org/10.4321/s1135-57272012000400005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076083/,economics
"Most estimates of the consequences of alternative health insurance proposals focus on national impact, but the extent of cross-state diversity in uninsurance rates, economic and labor-market characteristics, and health care markets suggests that the impact of strategies will also vary. We illustrate this variation by comparing the effects of standard tax credit and Medicaid expansion proposals across states. Some states do well (or poorly) under all policies; others benefit under some but not others. Across policies, state effects on uninsurance rates vary by at least a factor of 2.5. Uniform national strategies that target the uninsured do not generate uniform national outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w5.259,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15941741/,economics
"As high-cost users of health care, people with disabilities or chronic conditions are particularly vulnerable to risk selection. Preferred risk selection, in which insurers avoid enrolling high-risk people, threatens their access to coverage. Adverse selection, in which high-risk people enroll in the most generous plans, compromises the financial viability of plans that are most responsive to their specific needs. The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits some forms of risk selection, but does not prevent all disability-based distinctions in insurance practices. From a disability perspective, risk selection must be addressed in a manner that: (1) adequately reflects the health care costs of such individuals; (2) eliminates their need to engage in adverse selection; (3) does not stigmatize them; (4) preserves confidentiality of information; (5) uses substantial outcome measures to ensure quality; and (6) creates market conditions that discourage disability-based discrimination. A risk adjuster based on prior use/expenditures or on a diagnostic indicator sensitive to disability issues may be effective. Failure of reform to address risk selection may threaten the viability of a market-based health care system.",https://doi.org/10.1053/apmr.2001.20829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11295020/,economics
"The responsibility for healthcare in Sweden is shared by the central government, county councils and municipalities. The counties and municipalities are free to make their own prioritizations within the framework of the state healthcare laws. To guide prioritization of healthcare resources in Sweden, there is consensus that cost-effectiveness constitutes one of the three principles. The objective of this paper is to describe how cost-effectiveness, and hence health economic evaluations (HEE), have a role in pricing decisions, reimbursement of pharmaceuticals as well as the overall prioritization and allocation of resources in the Swedish healthcare system. There are various organizations involved in the processes of implementing health technologies in the Swedish healthcare system, several of which consider or produce HEEs when assessing different technologies: the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV), the county councils' group on new drug therapies (NLT), the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU), regional HTA agencies and the Public Health Agency of Sweden. The only governmental agency that has official and mandatory guidelines for how to perform HEE is TLV (LFNAR 2003:2). Even though HEEs may seem to have a clear and explicit role in the decision-making processes in the Swedish healthcare system, there are various obstacles and challenges in the use and dissemination of the results.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2014.09.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444295/,economics

Public finance share and inflation were found to be associated with lower per capita health care expenditure. No consistent correlation was found between the age-dependency ratio and health care expenditure.

"Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) and its Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG) have celebrated a second anniversary. There is little doubt that the momentum of change started by the prospective payment concept will be around for some time. The formula for success contains a new approach to the management of health care organizations, instilling new life into health care management, creating challenges of new relationships and roles for medical staff, and serving to reshape the organizational structure of health care providers. Medicare will not be the only benefactor of this new scheme as prepayment spreads to other payors and providers of health care. Health care organizations have an opportunity to be innovative. Success will depend on whether health care executives and physicians can change, whether the results are satisfactory to users and payors, and whether the right incentives are preserved. The practice of infectious disease can play a unique and beneficial role in the prevention and control of infections through cost-effective surveillance programs and in the development and management of the antibiotics formulary.

"The fate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 is uncertain. Much of the opposition is grounded in popular hostility to expansive federal control over individuals' health care decision-making. But the new law reinforces existing third-party payment, primarily through employers and government programs. This financing already restricts personal choice of health plans and coverage options. Private employers, managed care executives, and public officials make the key spending decisions in health care. Unlike consumers in other sectors of the economy, individuals are mostly passive spectators. Normal market dynamics do not exist, and consumer choice is frustrated. Curiously, public programs, such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the Medicare Advantage Program, and the Medicare Part D Drug program, are the main exceptions to the norm. In these programs, individuals control the flow of dollars over the purchase of health plans. In crucial areas such as access to care and benefits, cost control, quality, and patient satisfaction, these programs have a strong record. By realigning health reform with the primacy of personal choice, and building on the experience of these programs, policymakers can expand consumer control through defined-contribution financing. Specifically, Congress can replace the existing tax regime for commercial private health insurance with a national tax credit system, provide generous financial assistance for the poor, and transform Medicare into a ""premium support"" program.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-720x.2012.00689.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23061584/,economics

"COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Europe. The purpose of this literature review was to critically evaluate published data on COPD prevalence and the cost of COPD interventions in European countries. Selection of literature was based on article retrieval from a systematic literature search using PubMed and EMBASE. Only articles providing data in European countries published between January 1990 and March 2003 were included. European epidemiological (cross-sectional, cohort, case-control) and economic (cost-of-illness-, cost-minimization-, cost-effectiveness-, cost-benefit-, cost-utility-analysis) studies were included. Of 74 retrieved epidemiologic studies, only seven (9%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In the selected literature, COPD prevalence ranged from 3% among Finnish women to 57% among Italian men and women, 45 years and older. Of 56 economic studies, 24 satisfied entry criteria. Results from the final cost-of-illness studies indicated that hospital care and medication represented the major portion of costs associated with COPD. In a survey conducted in 1998/99, annual direct expenditures for COPD treatment per patient in Europe ranged from Euro 530 in France to Euro 3238 in Spain. There was a differential increase in COPD prevalence predominantly related to an aging patient population, with a high incidence of exposure to cigarette smoke. Data also showed differences in the economic impact of COPD in Europe based on the proportion of patients with severe COPD, frequency of exacerbations, and number of hospitalizations. Overall, results of this review demonstrated the need for global epidemiologic and economic studies to allow for more uniform guidelines for the prevention and cost-effective treatment of patients with COPD.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00151829-200504060-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16336024/,economics

"Local authorities in England have responsibility for public health, however, in recent years, budgets have been drastically reduced placing decision makers under unprecedented financial pressure. Although health economics can offer support for decision making, there is limited evidence of it being used in practice. The aim of this study was to undertake in-depth qualitative research within one local authority to better understand the context for public health decision making; what, and how economics evidence is being used; and invite suggestions for how methods could be improved to better support local public health decision making. The study included both observational methods and in-depth interviews. Key meetings were observed and semi-structured interviews conducted with participants who had a decision-making role to explore views on economics, to understand the barriers to using evidence and to invite suggestions for improvements to methods. Despite all informants valuing the use of health economics, many barriers were cited: including a perception of a narrow focus on the health sector; lack of consideration of population impact; and problems with translating long timescales to short term impact. Methodological suggestions included the broadening of frameworks; increased use of natural experiments; and capturing wider non-health outcomes that resonate with the priorities of multiple stakeholders.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s174413311800052x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30632474/,economics
"The new treatment procedures of the German Statutory Accident Insurance (DGUV) have ramifications for the injury type procedure clinics (VAV) from medical, economic and structural aspects. Whereas the latter can be assessed as positive, the medical and economical aspects are perceived as being negative. Problems arise from the partially unclear formulation of the injury type catalogue, which results in unpleasant negotiations with the occupational insurance associations with respect to financial remuneration for services rendered. Furthermore, the medical competence of the VAV clinics will be reduced by the preset specifications of the VAV catalogue, which opens up an additional field of tension between medical treatment, fulfillment of the obligatory training and acquisition of personnel as well as the continually increasing economic pressure. From the perspective of the author, the relinquence of medical competence imposed by the regulations of the new VAV catalogue is ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" because many VAV clinics nationwide also partially have competence in the severe injury type procedure (SAV). A concrete ""competence-based approval"" for the individual areas of the VAV procedure would be sensible and would maintain the comprehensive care of insured persons and also increase or strengthen the willingness of participating VAV hospitals for unconditional implementation of the new VAV procedure.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00113-017-0393-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28801739/,economics

This model is to be seen as a tool of commercialism, and such a restructuring of psychiatry represents a wide-reaching political maneuver which actively introduces economical parameters into the field and will have a great impact on psychiatry. P4P starts with the false premise that medicine has to be structured like industry. This premise is false because psychiatry has to do with relationships to patients, and not with the production of a product.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To analyze the impacts of pharmaceutical sector policies implemented to contain country spending during the economic recession--a reference price system in Finland and a mix of policies including changes in reimbursement rates, a generic promotion campaign and discounts granted to the public payer in Portugal - on utilization of, as a proxy for access to, antipsychotic medicines.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      We obtained monthly IMS Health sales data in standard units of antipsychotic medicines in Portugal and Finland for the period January 2007 to December 2011. We used an interrupted time series design to estimate changes in overall use and generic market shares by comparing pre-policy and post-policy levels and trends.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both countries' policy approaches were associated with slight, likely unintended, decreases in overall use of antipsychotic medicines and with increases in generic market shares of major antipsychotic products. In Finland, quetiapine and risperidone generic market shares increased substantially (estimates one year post-policy compared to before, quetiapine: 6.80% [3.92%, 9.68%]; risperidone: 11.13% [6.79%, 15.48%]. The policy interventions in Portugal resulted in a substantially increased generic market share for amisulpride (estimate one year post-policy compared to before: 22.95% [21.01%, 24.90%]; generic risperidone already dominated the market prior to the policy interventions.

      Different policy approaches to contain pharmaceutical expenditures in times of the economic recession in Finland and Portugal had intended--increased use of generics--and likely unintended--slightly decreased overall sales, possibly consistent with decreased access to needed medicines--impacts.

"Objectives:
        
      
      This article presents an overview of the Spanish health sector variables and drug policies as well as highlights the perspectives of new reforms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Initially, the text frames the health sector in the sociodemographic context; it describes the past two decades of demographic changes noting particularly the very low birth rate and the growth in the proportion of the elderly. It also summarizes the main aggregate economic trends emphasizing the gross national product growth of near an annual 4% for the past 10 years and the decrease in the unemployment rate from high values of approximately 20% to half that rate in the same period, together with a stabilization of the inflation rate around 4%, still higher than EU average values. Second, this article describes the Spanish health sector organization and financing, underlining that it is mostly a publicly funded system (approximately 80% of total health-care expenditures are public) and that the universal coverage is financed out of general taxation after two decades of transition from social security-based premiums. Simultaneously to that universalization of the health-care rights, Spain started a political decentralization process in almost all the spheres of the public administration, health issues included. The article describes the changes in budgeting, management, and funding that nowadays fully belong to the regions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An essential part of the text is devoted to the pharmaceutical sector and its policies. Drug budgets represent almost 25% of the total public health expenditures; this proportion is approximately 50% of primary care expenditures. The incentive payments to achieve a more efficient prescription are approximately 2% of primary care physicians' gross salary. Doctors in hospitals have scarce incentives related to this issue. Some examples are presented of how this decentralization process affects the pharmaceutical policies that are designed and implemented by both the central and the regional governments. Regions are currently developing health technology assessment departments that will also perform activities on the economic evaluation of drugs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The planned reforms will still retain at the central government level the control of three major drug policies: authorization, pricing, and reimbursement. Several policies are currently focused on increasing the 6% share of generic drugs in the total drug market toward the EU average. The decentralization will allow the regions to modify some reimbursement policies and mainly to establish new incentives on prescription and purchasing procedures of drugs by the hospitals. The new drug agency is foreseen to assume the utilization of cost-effectiveness studies to provide economic information in the pricing and reimbursement processes.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1524-4733.6.s1.6.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12846926/,economics

"Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland have taken steps toward regulated competition on the health insurance market to enhance efficiency and consumer responsiveness. The rationale of giving the consumer a periodic choice of health insurer is that individual risk-bearing insurers are stimulated to effectively purchase and manage the care on behalf of their enrollees. For Europe this is largely a terra incognita, while the United States have at least fifty years of relevant experience. Twenty years ago the United States were confronted with a substantial backlash against managed care. Based on the US experience we come to the following lessons for Europe. First, the greatest backlash against managed care can be expected from the healthcare providers. Second, consumers are willing to give up to some extent their free choice of healthcare provider in return for a lower premium. Third, insurers should (be allowed to) offer consumers a choice between an insurance product with free choice of provider and lower-priced products with restricted reimbursement for non-contracted providers. Fourth, insurers should use input from consumers, provide them in a timely manner with relevant information about the (non-) contracted providers, and reassure consumers that in-network providers offer good quality care. Fifth, the development of national guidelines and quality indicators, with input from the medical profession, can increase the acceptance of managed care.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.03.010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27055353/,economics

          Results:
        
      
      The influence of economic data in the decision-making process is limited, for other factors appear to have greater weight: (1) efficacy and safety of medicines (2) relations between decision-makers and the pharmaceutical industry and (3) patient quality of life. Economic data used was mainly related to medication prices and quantities consumed. This data was used in a large number of decisions and seemed to have more importance in hospitals than in clinics. Information related to resources that could be saved by the inclusion of a new medicine on formularies was seldom used and apparently considered less important in hospitals than in clinics. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations were very rarely used. Six barriers to the use of economic data were raised by the pharmacists, including: lack of time, which limits the collection and analysis of such information; insufficient health economics training, an obstacle to decision-makers' analytical capacity; and closed budgets within hospitals.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Economic data concerning 'medication budgets' appears to have a greater impact in public and semi-private hospitals than in private clinics. Obstacles linked to the decision-making context itself were particularly highlighted, and it can be concluded that in order to increase the use of economic data, it is first necessary to create an environment that is more favourable to its application.",https://doi.org/10.1023/b:phar.0000006523.22131.69,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689815/,economics
"This paper has two, mutually supportive purposes: (1) to show that the modern economic rationale for universal social health insurance is consistent with the classical liberal understanding of property rights; (2) to show that the writings of the leading liberal sages-Locke, Smith, Mill, and Hayek-are congenial to programs economically similar to universal social health insurance, and, in Hayek's cases, were specifically approving. It is hoped that these facts and reasonings, which are unlikely to be known in toto to those who do not normally study across the intersection of philosophy and economics, will encourage a dialogue that reasserts in a non-ideological way the neglected role of property rights in the health economic assessment of social health insurance alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-005-6600-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15714262/,economics
"Several economic factors are forcing changes in the American health care system. Many of these future changes will be implemented by the government. If left unguided, the governmental agencies could regulate doctors' practices, duties, and fees and place them in a bureaucratic maze. The cost of these changes to society may not represent either a cash saving or increased quality of medical care. Some of the anticipated changes could make medicine a less rewarding intellectual career. We, as dermatologists, should be aware of these changes as they affect our specialty, and we should actively work with our governmental authorities to ensure that any changes in our profession will really benefit the tax-paying public.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-4362.1985.tb05763.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4008150/,economics
"The health care system in the United States is in chaos. The conflict is between containing costs on an aggregate level while, at the same time, not reducing services to the individual if the services are essential for quality care. There is little information on which to base decisions about the value of services. Health care organizations and delivery models must be restructured because current models are out of date. To accomplish this restructuring, better information is needed on why hospitals and doctors do what they do. Success in developing information and decision models that result in patients receiving only medically necessary services will contribute greatly to promoting high quality, cost-conscious care.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0735-1097(89)90155-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2671099/,economics

"The friction-cost method has been put forward as an alternative to the human-capital method as it allows more realistic estimates of productivity costs to be calculated for use in economic evaluations. The possibility of replacement of (long-term) absentees is at the heart of the friction-cost method. It recognises that society will restore initial production levels after some period of adaptation, the length of which may depend on the availability of labour and, hence, on unemployment. The friction-cost method has received two main criticisms in the literature: (i) it has no theoretical underpinning; and (ii) it treats leisure time as having no value. We demonstrate in a simple 'theoretical' time-allocation model how time use shifts in the friction-cost method and that leisure is not treated as having no value. Rather, it is considered to be valued in terms of QALYs--as is normally the case in economic evaluation. The time-allocation model also demonstrates that when using the friction-cost or human-capital method the changes in the amount of unpaid work and leisure time need to be valued separately. Unpaid production losses from the previously unemployed may be larger than the gain in unpaid production gain of the absentee, resulting in a societal loss of unpaid work or the sacrifice of leisure in order to make up for lost unpaid work. These changes should be incorporated into economic analyses.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200523020-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15748085/,economics
"This paper examines the development of contracting within the NHS on the basis of the data collected as part of a national survey of English District Health Authorities carried out in late 1994. The paper starts with a discussion of the background to contracting and its evolution during the first 4 years of the NHS internal market. The second section describes the methodology employed in the national survey. The third section presents the results of the survey alongside a discussion of their relevance in terms of the economics of contracting. This section shows the prevalence of different types of contracts and discusses the emergence of the most common type-sophisticated block contracts. Details are provided of how contracts deal with issues such as the measurement of activity, the pricing of projected activity and of activity variances (mainly at marginal cost), as well as the involvement of clinicians in contracting. Other topics explored include the management of extra contractual referrals, contracting for specialized services, arbitration arrangements, the purchaser efficiency index and contracts with the independent sector. The final section offers some concluding thoughts on the current state and future of contracting in the NHS.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199607)5:4<353::aid-hec215>3.0.co;2-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8880172/,economics
"The interest of nurses in methods of economic evaluation appears limited to cost-effectiveness analysis, with an apparent unawareness of other methods of economic appraisal and the types of efficiency they consider. The main methods of economic appraisal are discussed, and linked to different kinds of efficiency. Methods for the valuation of health states, an important accompaniment to the methods of economic appraisal, are briefly described along with some of the practical difficulties. If skilled nursing care--alone or with other disciplines--changes health status then the measurement and valuation of such states may be used to inform resource allocation decisions involving nursing. It could be argued that the main impact of nursing is on quality of life, and if so this suggests cost utility analysis, and not cost-effectiveness analysis, as the natural level of appraisal for nursing. The use of these methods in research, and participation in their future development, are both suggested as valid targets for nurses to aim for.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.1995.tb02529.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7714290/,economics
"A review of the relation between insurance and psychiatric services addresses the economic concerns involved. Under third-party reimbursement, a range of predictability and stability of treatment costs is observed; overall cost benefit and effectiveness for a variety of therapeutic procedures is demonstrated and socio-cultural factors play a role in the users demand behavior. The cost of medical care is a small percentage of the system's total cost and judicious use of psychiatric consultation reduces medical and surgical expenditures. Inherent difficulties for the profession exist in a universal health care scheme. The acceptability of psychological impairment and the confidentiality dilemma are among the issues reviewed. Further attention must be paid to the therapist's fee, behaviour and income needs. A traditional defensiveness regarding these matters should be overcome through a peer review process in order to further delineate responsible financial norms of psychiatric practice. The ""laissez-faire"" attitude observed in most of our training programs towards financial matters must be addressed in order to participate effectively in the ongoing sociopolitical dialogue on the funding of health care.",https://doi.org/10.1177/070674378503000304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3922609/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Examine the effects of regulated competition on the drug pricing in China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on product-level data, a regression method was employed for pricing by using data from Tianjin Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) database. The market competition measures distinguished generic competition within the same molecule from therapeutic competition within the same therapeutic class.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The increases in pricing are inversely related to the number of generic competitions. The generic sub-group results vary from the originator sub-group. For the generics, generic competition has a significantly reduced effect on the price; however, only therapeutic competition has a significantly reduced effect on the originator price.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Regulated competition has a positive role in shaping the pharmaceutical market. Furthermore, regulated competition affects the price differently for the sub-groups. The promotion of competition between generic and originator in order to reap full competition benefit and reduce frictions among policies are necessary.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2017.1251318,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27762144/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Despite the huge cost of the program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has maintained a policy that cost-effectiveness is not considered in national coverage determinations (NCDs).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess whether an implicit cost-effectiveness threshold exists and to determine if economic evidence has been considered in previous NCDs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was conducted to identify estimates of cost-effectiveness relevant to each NCD from 1999-2007 (n = 103). The economic evaluation that best represented each coverage decision was included in a review of the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions considered in NCDs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 64 coverage decisions determined to have a corresponding cost-effectiveness estimate, 49 were associated with a positive coverage decision and 15 with a noncoverage decision. Of the positive decisions, 20 were associated with an economic evaluation that estimated the intervention to be dominant (costs less and was more effective than the alternative), 12 with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than $50,000, 8 with an ICER greater than $50,000 but less than $100,000, and 9 with an ICER greater than $100,000. Fourteen of the sample of 64 decision memos cited or discussed cost-effectiveness information.
    


          Conclusions:

"There has been much recent debate in the health economics literature as to the (near) equivalence of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that whether such a (near) equivalence exists depends on whether one defines economic evaluations as 'CBA' or 'CEA' on the basis of either what is measured or what question the analyst is seeking to answer. The former basis of definition is popular within the 'decision science' approach to economic evaluation, but does not seem to have any theoretical support. If the latter, more theoretically correct, basis is accepted, there is no longer a case for the (near) equivalence of CBA and CEA.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199813040-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10178663/,economics
"Traditionally, most health care systems which pretend to any sort of rationality and cost control have sought to allocate their limited funds in order to secure equal opportunity of access for equal need. The UK government is implementing a fundamental change of resource allocation philosophy towards 'contributing to the reduction of avoidable health inequalities'. The purpose of this essay is to explore some of the economic issues that arise when seeking to allocate health care resources according to the new criterion. It indicates that health inequalities might arise because of variations in the quality of health services, variations in access to those services, or variations in the way people produce health, and that the resource allocation consequences differ depending on which source is being addressed. The paper shows that an objective of reducing health inequalities is not necessarily compatible with an objective of equity of access, nor with the objective of maximising health gain. The results have profound consequences for approaches towards economic evaluation, the role of clinical guidelines and performance management, as well as for resource allocation methods.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.692,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12457368/,economics
"This study assesses the impact of certificate-of-need (CON) regulation for hospitals on various measures of health spending per capita, hospital supply, diffusion of technology, and hospital industry organization. Using a time series cross-sectional methodology, we estimate the net impact of CON policies on costs, supply, technology diffusion, and industry organization, controlling for area characteristics, the presence of other forms of regulation, such as hospital rate-setting, and competition. Mature CON programs are associated with a modest (5 percent) long-term reduction in acute care spending per capita, but not with a significant reduction in total per capita spending. There is no evidence of a surge in acquisition of facilities or in costs following removal of CON regulations. Mature CON programs also result in a slight (2 percent) reduction in bed supply but higher costs per day and per admission, along with higher hospital profits. CON regulations generally have no detectable effect on diffusion of various hospital-based technologies. It is doubtful that CON regulations have had much effect on quality of care, positive or negative. Such regulations may have improved access, but there is little empirical evidence to document this.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-23-3-455,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9626641/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      To examine the effect of the recession on the financial performance of safety-net versus non-safety-net hospitals.
    


          Data sources/study setting:
        
      
      Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases, Medicare Cost Reports, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, InterStudy, and Area Health Resource File.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Retrospective, longitudinal panel of hospitals, 2007-2011. Safety-net hospitals were identified using percentage of patients who were Medicaid or uninsured. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate average effects of the recession on hospital operating and total margins, revenues and expenses in each year, 2008-2011, comparing safety-net with non-safety-net hospitals.
    


          Data collection/extraction methods:
        
      
      1,453 urban, nonfederal, general acute hospitals in 32 states with complete data.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      Safety-net hospitals, as identified in 2007, had lower operating and total margins. The gap in operating margin between safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals was sustained throughout the recession; however, total margin was more negatively affected for non-safety-net hospitals in 2008. Higher percentages of Medicaid and uninsured patients were associated with lower revenue in private hospitals in all years, and lower revenue and expenses in public hospitals in 2011.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Safety-net hospitals may not be disproportionately vulnerable to macro-economic fluctuations, but their significantly lower margins leave less financial cushion to weather sustained financial pressure.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.12230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25220012/,economics

"Economic evaluation is used for decision-making processes in healthcare technologies in many developed countries. In Japan, no health economic data have been requested for drugs, medical devices, and interventions till date. However, economic evaluation is gradually gaining importance, and a trial implementation of the cost-effectiveness evaluation of drugs and medical devices has begun. Discussions on economic evaluation began in May 2012 within a newly established sub-committee of the Chuikyo, referred to as the ""Special Committee on Cost Effectiveness."" After four years of discussions, this committee determined that during the trial implementation, the results of the cost-effectiveness evaluation would be used for the re-pricing of drugs and medical devices at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2017. Chuikyo selected 13 products (7 drugs and 6 medical devices) as targets for this evaluation. These products will be evaluated until the end of FY 2017 based on the following process: manufacturers will submit the data of economic evaluation; the National Institute of Public Health will coordinate the review process; academic groups will perform the actual review of the submitted data, and the expert committee will appraise these data.

"Benefit incidence analysis (BIA) considers who (in terms of socio-economic groups) receive what benefit from using health services. While traditionally BIA has focused on only publicly funded health services, to assess whether or not public subsidies are 'pro-poor', the same methodological approach can be used to assess how well the overall health system is performing in terms of the distribution of service benefits. This is becoming increasingly important in the context of the growing emphasis on promoting universal health systems. To conduct a BIA, a household survey dataset that incorporates both information on health service utilization and some measure of socio-economic status is required. The other core data requirement is unit costs of different types of health service. When utilization rates are combined with unit costs for different health services, the distribution of benefits from using services, expressed in monetary terms, can be estimated and compared with the distribution of the need for health care. This paper aims to provide an introduction to the methods used in the 'traditional' public sector BIA, and how the same methods can be applied to undertake an assessment of the whole health system.

"Aim:
        
      
      To investigate whether screening for gallstone disease was economically feasible and clinically effective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This clinical study was initially conducted in 2002 in Taipei, Taiwan. The study cohort total included 2386 healthy adults who were voluntarily admitted to a regional teaching hospital for a physical check-up. Annual follow-up screening with ultrasound sonography for gallstone disease continued until December 31, 2007. A decision analysis using the Markov Decision Model was constructed to compare different screening regimes for gallstone disease. The economic evaluation included estimates of both the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of screening for gallstone disease.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Direct costs included the cost of screening, regular clinical fees, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and hospitalization. Indirect costs represent the loss of productivity attributable to the patient's disease state, and were estimated using the gross domestic product for 2011 in Taiwan. Longer time intervals in screening for gallstone disease were associated with the reduced efficacy and utility of screening and with increased cost. The cost per life-year gained (average cost-effectiveness ratio) for annual screening, biennial screening, 3-year screening, 4-year screening, 5-year screening, and no-screening was new Taiwan dollars (NTD) 39076, NTD 58059, NTD 72168, NTD 104488, NTD 126941, and NTD 197473, respectively (P < 0.05). The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained by annual screening was NTD 40725; biennial screening, NTD 64868; 3-year screening, NTD 84532; 4-year screening, NTD 110962; 5-year screening, NTD 142053; and for the control group, NTD 202979 (P < 0.05). The threshold values indicated that the ultrasound sonography screening programs were highly sensitive to screening costs in a plausible range.

"Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) were introduced in Germany in 2004 as a medico-economic classification system. In this analysis, we looked at reconstructive surgery after breast cancer, focusing on changes of the fee-per-case system in the last 6 years. Immediate, delayed, pedicle and free flaps as well as alloplastic reconstructive methods were analysed using data from German reference hospitals. We analysed the length of stay, reimbursements, costs and profits. The biggest profit margin was found in free perforator flaps. These were up to 3 times higher than in alloplastic reconstruction and pedicle flaps. Due to the fact that the underlying costs for the calculation of reimbursement are always retrospective, we accounted for the rate of price increase. In spite of increasing mean profits, foregone profits of up to €574 per case due to inflation were not taken into consideration. Contrary to actual guidelines, neither the immediate reconstruction of the breast by autologous tissue, nor the bilateral reconstruction is taken into account economically. Although a more differentiated reimbursement of breast reconstruction by DRG has taken place in the last years, the subject still remains a classical example for insufficient mapping of new medical standards in our DRG system. As the choice of surgical therapy is increasingly influenced by free market mechanisms, the risk for economic selection in contradiction to clinical recommendations becomes a real problem. Even 9 years after its introduction, the German DRG system is far from being a learning or quick adapting system.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1306362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22495963/,economics
"With the advent of government guidelines for the provision of cost-effectiveness data, economic evidence has been elevated to a status similar to that of evidence of efficacy and safety, which is required before licensing of pharmaceutical products. Whilst the precise nature of government requirements is likely to vary from place to place, they pose a number of practical problems for pharmaceutical companies, in the funding of studies and in the need to modify the clinical trials programme to facilitate economic data collection. Economic evaluation requirements have been viewed by various parties as a basis for pricing and reimbursement, as a form of cost containment and as a way of securing more value for money in the healthcare system. It is unlikely that economic evidence could ever form the sole basis for setting price, since both industry and government often seek to introduce other factors into the price negotiations. Requirements for economic evidence may also be an inefficient form of cost containment, compared with other methods such as budgetary caps. These offer some potential as a way of securing more value for money, but they should be applied equally across all health technologies. In the future there needs to be much more clarity of purpose in government guidelines, and methodological standards for economic analysis need to be refined.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199400061-00012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10155586/,economics
"The interest in economic evaluation of health care programmes is steadily increasing, but the impact of economic evaluations on decisions concerning the allocation of resources to health care programmes is unclear. In this paper we examine different decision and policy situations where economic evaluation of health care programmes could potentially be used. Economic evaluation as an aid to: the development of treatment guidelines, decisions within health care organizations, introduction of new medical technologies, reimbursement decisions, and pricing decisions are examined. It is concluded that economic evaluation seems to be most useful in the development of treatment guidelines and as an aid to reimbursement decisions. The importance of the incentives to use economic evaluation embodied in the health care system is also stressed. It is argued that it is too early to introduce regulations that require the use of economic evaluation in for instance reimbursement decisions. A more cautious approach may be preferred with economic evaluation used more selectively until the methods and the field have developed further.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(95)00716-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10145120/,economics

"As healthcare expenses grow, concern about how government and private agencies decide to allocate funds for healthcare resources and services also grows. Decisions for healthcare funding are not made arbitrarily but are based on sound ethical principles and practical considerations. This article is a review of 5 ethically based healthcare funding models discussed in the literature that are currently used to justify funding choices. If healthcare professionals and managers are better informed about the ethical reasoning behind funding choices, they could better determine which resource allocation alternatives to support. But where should we spend our resources? Although healthcare professionals have a duty to advocate for all healthcare recipients to receive a fair share of resources, the author concludes that our greater duty as a profession is to the good of society as a whole. Balancing allocation decisions by considering all of the competing healthcare funding models and the ethical bases for them is suggested rather than to advocate too strongly for favored models.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00128488-200410000-00008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15586083/,economics

"Choices on discount rates have important implications for the outcomes of economic evaluations of health interventions and policies. In global health, such evaluations typically apply a discount rate of 3% for health outcomes and costs, mirroring guidance developed for high-income countries, notably the USA. The article investigates the suitability of these guidelines for global health [i.e. with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)] and seeks to identify best practice. Our analysis builds on an overview of the academic literature on discounting in health evaluations, existing academic or government-related guidelines on discounting, a review on discount rates applied in economic evaluations in global health, and cross-country macroeconomic data. The social discount rate generally applied in global health of 3% annually is inconsistent with rates of economic growth experienced outside the most advanced economies. For low- and lower-middle-income countries, a discount rate of at least 5% is more appropriate, and one around 4% for upper-middle-income countries. Alternative approaches-e.g. motivated by the returns to alternative investments or by the cost of financing-could usefully be applied, dependent on policy context. The current practise could lead to systematic bias towards over-valuing the future costs and health benefits of interventions. For health economic evaluations in global health, guidelines on discounting need to be adapted to take account of the different economic contexts of LMICs.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czz127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31625564/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      In the absence of socio-economical consequences of hypersomnia this study addresses the factual indirect and direct costs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two thousand two hundred and eight patients with a hypersomnia diagnosis from 1998 to 2005 were identified in the Danish national patient registry (NPR), each compared with 4 age and gender adjusted, randomly chosen citizens selected from the Civil Registration System Statistics. The health cost was decomposed in direct and indirect yearly costs, including labor supply and social transfer payments. Direct costs included frequencies and costs of discharges and outpatient use by cost weights according to diagnosis related groups and specific outpatient prices based on data from The Danish Ministry of Health. The use of and costs of drugs was based on data from the Danish Medicines Agency. The frequencies and costs from primary sectors were based on data from The National Health Security. Indirect costs were based on income data from the coherent social statistics (CSS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients with hypersomnia presented significant higher health related contact rate, expenses and medication use. No differences were identified in employment and income. The yearly sum of direct and indirect costs were yearly euro3402 vs. euro1212 in controls (P < 0.001), corresponding to a yearly excess costs euro2190. The patients presented higher transfer income, total euro889.

"Background:
        
      
      This article is the first of two that focus on recent changes in the funding of dental services in the United States.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study is based on analyses of data regarding dental expenditures among children 2 to 17 years of age from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey and the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Both of these surveys were designed to produce national estimates of annual medical expenditures in the United States.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, real per capita dental expenditures among 2- to 17-year-old children who had had a dental visit fell from $578.05 in 1987 to $498.57 in 1996. Large increases per patient were reported for the poorest children, while decreases were reported for children from families with higher incomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Much of the increase from 1987 to 1996 in dental expenditures among economically disadvantaged children who had had a dental visit was due to an increase in care provided by dentists that was not reimbursed.
    


          Practice implications:

"Purpose:
        
      
      To identify the potential effect on global economic productivity of successful interventions, that are planned as part of the ""VISION 2020-right to sight"" initiative. The initiative aims to eliminate avoidable blindness.
    


          Design:
        
      
      This study used economic and epidemiologic modeling.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Existing data and assumptions about blindness prevalence, national populations, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, labor force participation, and unemployment rates were used to project the economic productivity loss associated with unaccommodated blindness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Without extra interventions, the global number of blind individuals would increase from 44 million in the year 2000 to 76 million in 2020. A successful VISION 2020 initiative would result in only 24 million blind in 2020 and lead to 429 million blind person-years avoided.

"The purpose of this report was to: (i) outline the potential value of health economic studies into age-related macular degeneration (AMD); (ii) provide an overview of health economic studies pertinent to AMD; and (iii) outline the basic frame work of cost-of-illness studies (a useful first step in applying economic methods). The detection and management of sensory loss in the elderly plays a key role in the Australian Government's Healthy Ageing Strategy. Age-related macular degeneration is currently the leading cause of blindness in elderly Australians. Although a large proportion of AMD cases remain untreatable, the introduction of photo-dynamic therapy provides a relatively expensive and possibly cost-effective innovation for others. Antioxidant therapy has also been proven effective in reducing progression of early to late disease. The discipline of economics can contribute to an understanding of AMD prevention and treatment through: (i) describing the current burden of disease; (ii) predicting the changes in the burden of disease over time, and (iii) evaluating the efficiency of different interventions. Cost-of-illness studies have been performed in many fields of medicine. Little work, however, has been done on describing the economic impact from AMD. A number of different economic evaluation methods can be used in judging the efficiency of possible interventions to reduce the disease burden of AMD. Although complementary in nature, each has specific uses and limitations. Studies of the economic impact of eye diseases are both feasible and necessary for informed health care decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1442-9071.2003.00715.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14641161/,economics
"Subclinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis is rarely treated during lactation because it is widely believed to be uneconomical, although there are no economic studies that support this view. Partial budgeting was used to develop a deterministic simulation model to estimate the net cost or benefit of antibiotic treatment of subclinical S. aureus mastitis during lactation. Direct and indirect effects of treatment were taken into account, including prevention of clinical flare-ups and contagious transmission. Input variables were based on literature and on 2003-2004 prices in the Netherlands. When contagious transmission of S. aureus was likely (reproductive ratio R = 5.3), 3- and 8-d treatments resulted in an average net profit of 95.62 euros and 142.42 euros, respectively, compared with no treatment. When the probability of S. aureus transmission was low (R = 0.32), the average economic benefit of 3- or 8-d treatment was -21.12 euros and -57.70 euros, respectively. On low-transmission farms, 3-d treatment was profitable when the appropriate cows were selected for treatment using known risk factors for cure. Sensitivity analysis showed that the 6 most influential input variables in the model were chance of bacteriological cure, R, probability of culling, retention pay-off, and cost of antibiotics and bacterial culture. Although the economic outcome of lactational treatment of subclinical S. aureus mastitis is highly herd-, cow-, and strain-dependent, treatment is economically justified in many situations.",https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.s0022-0302(05)73113-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16291618/,economics
"This study applied an economic framework to the analysis of public health nurse (PHN) salaries, assessing their relationships to nurse qualifications, agency resources, community economic base, and area competition for the nurse supply. Data were obtained through interviews with 125 Ohio health departments and from various state and local reports. Associations between salaries and explanatory variables were analyzed through correlations and stepwise regression models. The PHN salaries were significantly lower and more compressed than salaries for nurses in area hospitals. Agency and community characteristics were more important than nurse education and experience in explaining salary variations. Maximum PHN salary attainable was significantly related to level of health department funding and community unemployment rate. Health departments in rural locations paid lower salaries at both minimum and maximum levels. Evidence suggested the presence of entry-level wage competition by health departments with both area hospitals and other community nursing agencies. Each 1% increase in minimum hospital nurse salaries was linked to a 0.66% increase in PHN salaries. Findings support the need to improve competitive positions of health departments as nurse shortages intensify.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-1446.1990.tb00632.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2217057/,economics
"The economic crisis that struck most Latin American and Caribbean countries beginning in 1982 has caused sharp reductions in domestic investment and in imports; domestic consumption has been less affected, while public sector spending has responded in different degrees in different countries. In general, public spending on health decreased, sometimes quite dramatically, but some countries were able to maintain the real value of noninvestment spending for health by central governments. It is much harder to tell what may have happened to output of health services, and still harder to know how health status has been affected. Scattered evidence suggests two conclusions. First, worsened economic conditions can seriously damage health status, with effects on infant mortality and on the patterns of disease and death, especially for children. Second, these repercussions do not have to occur, and public programs designed specifically to maintain basic health services and to assure adequate nutrition are effective in offsetting the worst consequences of economic hardship.",https://doi.org/10.2190/7ec9-pm6n-6llj-x2pc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3114159/,economics

This is found to be the case even when the executive has the same opportunity cost of travel as her employees and even when the executive is the sole owner of the firm, retaining all profits.

"ESG factors are becoming mainstream in portfolio investment strategies, attracting increasing fund inflows from investors who are aligning their investment values to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) declared by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investments. Do investors sacrifice return for pursuing ESG-aligned megatrend goals? The study analyses the risk-adjusted financial performance of ESG-themed megatrend investment strategies in global equity markets. The analysis covers nine themes for the period 2015-2019: environmental megatrends covering energy efficiency, food security, and water scarcity; social megatrends covering ageing, millennials, and urbanisation; governance megatrends covered by cybersecurity, disruptive technologies, and robotics. We construct megatrend factor portfolios based on signalling theory and formulate a novel measure for stock megatrend exposure (MTE), based on the relative fund flows into the corresponding thematic ETFs. We apply pure factor portfolios methodology based on constrained WLS cross-sectional regressions to calculate Fama-French factor returns. Time-series regression rests on the generalised method of moments estimator (GMM) that uses robust distance instruments. Our findings show that each environmental megatrend, as well as the disruptive technologies megatrend, yielded positive and significant alphas relative to the passive strategy, although this outperformance becomes statistically insignificant in the Fama-French 5-factor model context. The important result is that most of the megatrend factor portfolios yielded significant non-negative alphas; which supports our assumption that megatrend investing strategy promotes SDGs while not sacrificing returns, even when accounting for transaction costs up to 50bps/annum. Higher transaction costs, as is the case for some of these ETFs with expense ratios reaching 80-100bps, may be an indication of two things: ESG-themed megatrend investors were willing to sacrifice ca. 30-50bps of annual return to remain aligned with sustainability targets, or that expense ratio may well decline in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244225,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33351834/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      This model introduces a unique and inexpensive technique to estimate profit increases that might be expected from: (i) an additional clinical trial to establish a drug's second clinical indication; and (ii) a survey of market demand.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Microsoft Excel spreadsheets are used to solicit selected expert opinions about the new product's annual market share under scenarios reflecting different pricing points, promotional expenditures and clinical advantage.
    


          Main outcome measures and results:
        
      
      The preprogrammed model returns profit-maximising price, promotional expenditure and market differentiation for each expert and the group as a whole. The extent of disagreement among the experts is used to estimate the additional profits which might be expected from a clinical trial and a market survey. Results from an illustrative application indicated greater incremental profits could be expected from the survey of market demand. The clinical trial generated smaller expected incremental profits because several experts felt that the trial's potential results would not affect the drug's profit-maximising price.
    


          Conclusions:

"The outcome of the competitive revolution in health care will depend critically on how it affects physicians' behavior and their interaction with patients. From the standpoint of physicians, competition often seems mediated by three influences affecting their day-to-day practice environment: the organizational phenomenon, the customer phenomenon, and the commodification phenomenon. A careful examination of these three phenomena offers reasons to believe that both the supporters and detractors of competition may be partially correct. Competitive markets may work extraordinarily well for some consumers and very poorly for others.

"Objective:
        
      
      Analyze statistical risks facing CMS and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We calculate the probability that shared savings formulas lead to inappropriate payment, payment denial, and/or financial penalties, assuming that ACOs generate real savings in Medicare spending ranging from 0-10%. We also calculate expected payments from CMS to ACOs under these scenarios.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The probability of an incorrect outcome is heavily dependent on ACO enrollment size. For example, in the MSSP two-sided model, an ACO with 5,000 enrollees that keeps spending constant faces a 0.24 probability of being inappropriately rewarded for savings and a 0.26 probability of paying an undeserved penalty for increased spending. For an ACO with 50,000 enrollees, both of these probabilities of incorrect outcomes are equal to 0.02. The probability of inappropriate payment denial declines as real ACO savings increase. Still, for ACOs with 5,000 patients, the probability of denial is at least 0.15 even when true savings are 5-7%. Depending on ACO size and the real ACO savings rate, expected ACO payments vary from $115,000 to $35.3 million.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our analysis indicates there may be greater statistical uncertainty in the MSSP than previously recognized. CMS and ACOs will have to consider this uncertainty in their financial, administrative, and care management planning. We also suggest analytic strategies that can be used to refine ACO payment formulas in the longer term to ensure that the MSSP (and other ACO initiatives that will be influenced by it) work as efficiently as possible.",https://doi.org/10.5600/mmrr.002.04.a04,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24800155/,economics

"Dr. E. Enghofer (Wien, Austria) summarized the content of the presentations and discussions of the symposium in his concluding remarks. 1. The organizers should be congradulated on their initiative in bringing together at the symposium experts from different disciplines, i.e., medicine, ethics, health economics, jurisprudence, the pharmaceutical industry and, last but not least, cost providers. 2. Health economics as an issue in health care has been around for quite some while. One example can be found in the German Drug Guidelines dating back to 1990, where the following terms have already been defined: therapeutic benefit, medical needs, and achieving therapeutic goals. 3. Health economics serves as a ""support function"" in the medical decision-making process. It has as yet no decisive role in the application to license a drug nor in questions concerning a physician's liability. Health economics as a discipline, however, was a reminder of, and served as a catalytic function for: a) The differentiation between the benefit of a medical intervention and its pure effectiveness. b) The definition of medical standards as a means to compare the quality of health care between different institutions, to uncover quality deficits and to develop strategies for the optimization of medical quality (quality management). Routine deviation from these standards is unethical. The German Cancer Society has taken on the task of defining such standards in cancer care. c) The difference between rationalising and rationing health care. The spending of the current health-care budget needs to be screened for unnecessary and/or inappropriate diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities as well as for ""below-standard"" care. The money that can be saved here can then be shifted towards financing ""state of the art"" medicine or can be used in the decision to substitute certain procedures. 4. The a priori definition of the desired outcome of a medical intervention is of paramount importance for the evaluation of the actual treatment result. Economical evaluations are easier when cure rather than palliation is the aim of a particular treatment and when alternative therapies do exist such that cost comparisons are possible. In any case, therapeutic interventions need to be adapted to the desired treatment goal; only then can the question be answered whether or not the means (cost) are (is) justified. 5. Outcome studies need to take into account every relevant medical aspect (i.e. disease management studies), and they should be accompanied by evaluation studies. The latter must also include unselected patients in daily practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01218528,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7593134/,economics
"Concerns exist regarding the additional cost of patient care when patients are enrolled in clinical trials at hospitals. To assess the avoidance of drug costs by conducting sponsored clinical trials, a retrospective analysis evaluating drug cost avoidance in all sponsored clinical trials was conducted in 2008 at the most prominent medical center in Taiwan. The National Health Insurance (NHI) reimbursement prices of either the investigated drugs or the standardized drug therapy for each specific disease were used to calculate the cost avoidance. Drug cost avoidance from sponsored clinical trials per year, per trial, per patient, in different therapeutic areas, and in different phases was analyzed. Three quarters of the cost avoidance in drug expenditures from 194 sponsored clinical trials were estimated. All cost values are in US Dollars. Around $11.2 million was avoided at the center in 2008. The average value of cost avoidance was $58,000/trial-year or $3,900/participant-year. The early-phase trials and phase III trials accounted for 25% and 56% of all trials, respectively, while they constituted 32% and 49% of the total costs avoided, respectively. The most frequently conducted and highest cost-avoiding trials were those for antineoplastic agents, especially targeted therapy which accounted for 85% of the total cost avoidance of anti-cancer trials. This study demonstrates the profoundly positive economic impact on the healthcare system in Taiwan by sponsored clinical trials. To understand the trend of economic benefits of the trials on pharmaceutical expenditure, it would be important to analyze the cost avoidance of trials regularly in an institution.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2011.04.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21530679/,economics
"The reforms to the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) of recent years have greatly increased the role of economic incentives in the hospital sector. Hospitals now have to compete for the business of GP and health authority purchasers and are assumed to have an incentive to minimise costs. This makes the analysis of cost functions much more relevant than has previously been the case. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential usefulness of the translog cost function applied in the NHS internal market. Three main issues are identified that limit the role of this type of cost function in the internal market: the adequacy of the econometric model (including data quality); the assumptions underlying the model, and; the interpretation of economies of scale, marginal costs and economies of scope that can be derived from such a cost function. It is concluded that at present the application of translog cost function analysis in the NHS is of limited usefulness, but that it does indicate areas for further methodological research.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4730040604,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653186/,economics
"Parasitology is a challenge. At one level, the structural and genetic complexities of parasites provide ample technical challenges in regard to an understanding of parasite variability and adaptability, epidemiological diversity, drug resistance, etc. The intricacies of host parasite relationships including the immunology of parasitism will continually surprise yet frustrate the vaccine developer and keep the bravest immunoparasitologist busy and creative for decades. As if the technical considerations were not challenging enough, we see difficulties arising in sustaining a research endeavour and preserving a critical mass of researchers through the generation of high-level, long-term funding support. Contributing to this situation is the fact that most parasitic diseases of major impact in humans are largely centred around the rural poor in tropical, less industrially-developed countries and therefore of little or of fickle interest to the strictly commercially oriented. Moreover, the focus in the rural industries has moved away from aspects of on-farm production with lower priority given to studies on even the 'economically-important' parasites of livestock. It is contended that this may change again with pressures and clear marketing advantages to preserving a 'clean and green' image for Australia's primary industries. Overall, the extraordinary technical and conceptual advances in recent times have been tempered by uncertainties in research funding and severe cuts from some traditional sources for both fundamental and strategic/applied research in Parasitology. Several have highlighted the fact that deliverables in terms of new methods of disease control have been sparse and some claims made in the past have certainly been exaggerated. Yet the prospects and achievements at the front end of the long R&D pathway have never been brighter. In this article we examine the merits of a 'portfolio approach' to generating research funds in Parasitology and Science and Technology in Australia more generally, with an emphasis on strategies that, through welding good science with clear, medium-term product objectives, increase research funding opportunities.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0020-7519(99)00053-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10480719/,economics

"The markets for health insurance and health care are not naturally competitive: they are susceptible to many forms of market failure. Health plans and consumers may use strategies that lead to inequity and inefficiency. But experience with successful models of competition suggests that tools are available to enable sponsors (active collective agents on the demand side who contract with health plans to structure and manage competition) to use competition to achieve a reasonable degree of efficiency and equity for their sponsored populations. All this implies a more complex, dynamic, and sophisticated view of competition than one usually finds in apologia for free markets.

"This study demonstrates that some safety-net hospitals--those that provide a large share of the care to low-income, uninsured, and Medicaid populations--survived and even thrived before the recent recession. We analyzed the financial performance and governance of 150 hospitals during 2003-07. We found, counterintuitively, that those directly governed by elected officials and in highly competitive markets were more profitable than other safety-net hospitals. They were financially healthy primarily because they obtained subsidies from state and local governments, such as property tax transfers or supplemental Medicaid payments, including disproportionate share payments. However, safety-net hospitals now face a new market reality. The economic downturn, slow recovery, and politics of deficit reduction have eroded the ability of local governments to support the safety net. Many safety-net hospitals have not focused on effective management, cost control, quality improvement, or services that attract insured patients. As a result, and coupled with new uncertainties regarding Medicaid expansion stemming from the recent Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act, many are likely to face increasing financial and competitive pressures that may threaten their survival.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.1401,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22869645/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      This contribution gives an overview on estimating the economic impact of substance use (SU) and substance use disorders (SUDs) from a societal perspective.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      In this Expert Review, we first discuss the scope of the economic costs of SU to society and the methods used to estimate them. In general, cost studies should not be limited to SUDs, but should also include costs related to the consequences of any type of SU to achieve a comprehensive picture of the societal burden. Further, estimating potentially avoidable costs will increase the value of cost studies. Importantly, methodologically sound cost studies shed light on the magnitude of societal problems related to SU and can be used as a reference point to evaluate regulatory policies and other preventive measures. The area of estimating potential economic benefits of SU is understudied and lacks a theoretical and methodological framework.
    


          Expert opinion:
        
      
      Overall, economic studies on the impact of SU and SUDs can strongly contribute to better-informed decision-making in the creation of regulatory and control policies. The least developed area of research refers to a consensus methodology that could be used in studies which compare economic costs to potential economic benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1916470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33899647/,economics
"The introduction of a new antidepressant, venlafaxine, a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), has provided researchers with the opportunity to take a closer look at the issues involved in selecting a product for a formulary. To aid decision makers in considering the adoption of this new therapy, a pharmacoeconomic simulation model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SNRIs versus traditional oral therapies in the management of patients with major depressive disorders (MDDs) from a cost-based payer perspective. Four treatment regimens for MDD were compared: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, heterocyclic antidepressants, and SNRIs. The principles of decision analysis were used to calculate outcome probabilities based on data from a meta-analysis. The expected cost of each regimen was calculated using cost data from a survey of three health maintenance organizations located in Missouri, Massachusetts, and California. The model suggests that SNRI therapy demonstrates the highest level of cost-effectiveness in an inpatient setting when using both brand and generic acquisition costs of the drugs. When comparing treatment regimens for out-patients, the generic heterocyclic antidepressants demonstrate the highest level of cost-effectiveness: when using band acquisition costs, the SNRIs demonstrate the highest level of cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis calculated the robustness of the conclusions to all major parameters.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0149-2918(95)80014-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7758056/,economics

"For the past 20 years, the federal government has reimbursed hospital services by administrating pricing. Simply put, under such a system the government dictated the prices of medical services. Not only has administrative pricing failed to control medical inflation, but such failure could have been predicted from a review of basic economics. Accordingly, to eliminate the deleterious effects of administrative pricing, it is not surprising that the government is gathering information on hospital quality and cost in anticipation of a return to a system in which the price for hospital services is determined by the market. For some hospitals, this will be good news because they will be able to negotiate a more favorable rate of reimbursement. Unfortunately, for some hospitals a market system will be bad news because the government is not going to negotiate a provider contract with every hospital. In short, when the government returns to a market system for pricing of hospital services, competition among hospitals is going to become even more competitive.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-9215.2004.03739.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15805767/,economics

"With the advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the issue of water shortage has become a bottleneck for China's economic development. Based on the structural decomposition analysis and multi-regional input-output tables of China in 2002 and 2012, this paper explores the drivers of the change in China's production water usage from the regional relevance perspective. Results show a significant increase in China's production water usage during the study period. The relationship between production water usage and per capita GDP shows an inverted U-shaped curve, and the economic scale by provinces has been improved, while the trend of production water usage differs. There are rapid increases in production water usage in economically developing provinces, while it is falling sharply in developed provinces. The crucial factors promoting its growth are changes in consumption level, population scale, and regional economic patterns. The technical effect is the most important factor in curbing the growth, followed by effects of final demand sectoral and distribution structure. The provinces and sectors with more production water usage shows higher technical and final demand effects. Therefore, it is necessary to promote water-saving activities, enhance the water-saving technical effect, and optimize final demand structure to promote economic growth with low-water usage.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11522-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230791/,economics
"We investigate determinants of market entry and premiums within the context of the Affordable Care Act's Marketplaces for individual insurance. Using Bresnahan and Reiss (1991) as the conceptual framework, we study how competition and firm heterogeneity relate to premiums in 36 states using Federally Facilitated or Supported Marketplaces in 2016. Our primary data source is the Qualified Health Plan Landscape File, augmented with market characteristics from the American Community Survey and Area Health Resource File as well as insurer-level information from federal Medical Loss Ratio annual reports. We first estimate a model of insurer entry and then investigate the relationship between a market's predicted number of entrants and insurer-level premiums. Our entry model results suggest that competition is increasing with the number of insurers, most notably as the market size increases from 3 to 4 entrants. Results from the premium regression suggest that each additional entrant is associated with approximately 4% lower premiums, controlling for other factors. An alternative explanation for the relationship between entrants and premiums is that more efficient insurers (who can price lower) are the ones that enter markets with many entrants, and this is reflected in lower premiums. An exploratory analysis of insurers' non-claims costs (a proxy for insurer efficiency) reveals that average costs among entrants are rising slightly with the number of insurers in the market. This pattern does not support the hypothesis that premiums decrease with more entrants because those entrants are more efficient, suggesting instead that the results are being driven mostly by price competition.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-017-9215-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28447230/,economics
"This paper examines the link between price regulation and pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) investment. I identify two mechanisms through which price regulation may exert an influence on R&D: an expected-profit effect and a cash-flow effect. Using established models of the determinants of pharmaceutical R&D, I exploit a unique fact to quantify firm exposure to pharmaceutical price regulation: relative to the rest of the world, the U.S. pharmaceutical market is largely unregulated with respect to price. Using this fact within the context of a system of quasi-structural equations, I simulate how a new policy regulating pharmaceutical prices in the U.S. will affect R&D investment. I find that such a policy will lead to a decline in industry R&D by between 23.4 and 32.7%. This prediction, however, is accompanied by several caveats. Moreover, it says nothing about the implications for social welfare; therefore, these issues are also discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.897,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15386673/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The United States is the only high-income nation without universal, government-funded or -mandated health insurance employing a unified payment system. The US multi-payer system leaves residents uninsured or underinsured, despite overall healthcare costs far above other nations. Single-payer (often referred to as Medicare for All), a proposed policy solution since 1990, is receiving renewed press attention and popular support. Our review seeks to assess the projected cost impact of a single-payer approach.
    


          Methods and findings:
        
      
      We conducted our literature search between June 1 and December 31, 2018, without start date restriction for included studies. We surveyed an expert panel and searched PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, and preexisting lists for formal economic studies of the projected costs of single-payer plans for the US or for individual states. Reviewer pairs extracted data on methods and findings using a template. We quantified changes in total costs standardized to percentage of contemporaneous healthcare spending. Additionally, we quantified cost changes by subtype, such as costs due to increased healthcare utilization and savings due to simplified payment administration, lower drug costs, and other factors. We further examined how modeling assumptions affected results. Our search yielded economic analyses of the cost of 22 single-payer plans over the past 30 years. Exclusions were due to inadequate technical data or assuming a substantial ongoing role for private insurers. We found that 19 (86%) of the analyses predicted net savings (median net result was a savings of 3.46% of total costs) in the first year of program operation and 20 (91%) predicted savings over several years; anticipated growth rates would result in long-term net savings for all plans. The largest source of savings was simplified payment administration (median 8.8%), and the best predictors of net savings were the magnitude of utilization increase, and savings on administration and drug costs (R2 of 0.035, 0.43, and 0.62, respectively). Only drug cost savings remained significant in multivariate analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in methods, which precluded us from conducting a formal meta-analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this systematic review, we found a high degree of analytic consensus for the fiscal feasibility of a single-payer approach in the US. Actual costs will depend on plan features and implementation. Future research should refine estimates of the effects of coverage expansion on utilization, evaluate provider administrative costs in varied existing single-payer systems, analyze implementation options, and evaluate US-based single-payer programs, as available.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31940342/,economics

Definitions of NHI have shifted depending on their perspectives and philosophical leanings, their understanding of the issues, and their degree of influence on the process. Based on NHI feasibility studies, market research, and stakeholder analysis conducted in five countries, this article analyses the policy formulation stage of NHI development in these tiny countries. Given the level of economic development and the existing administrative capacity of the governments, this 'phase one' NHI could be a pragmatic first step in introducing a health insurance component into the social security systems of the countries, and gradually reforming other aspects of the health sector. The article is structured around key questions which help to define the positions and relationships of key stakeholders, and then evaluate NHI plans in terms of economic viability, equity, administrative feasibility and efficiency, cost containment incentives, and political palatability.

"A simulation approach was used to compare the effects of different methods of determining reasonable charges for physicians' services under Medicare on government outlays, physician revenues, and beneficiaries' financial burdens. This is an important policy area because of fee inflation and rises in physician income. Queens County claims for 1976 and 1977 were used for this analysis. The different methods that were compared to the current method, which is the 75h percentile of weighted customary charges adjusted for the Economic Index, included a single prevailing that dispensed with specialty groupings, an unadjusted prevailing eliminating the Economic Index correction, and average reasonable charges in a base year computed with and without regard for specialty board certification. The results of the trials showed that program costs are about 8 per cent higher without the Economic Index. The single prevailing cuts government costs but substantially raises beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs. Patients not receiving assignment were most likely to have greater burdens. The average reasonable charge approach had little effect on any of the participants and does not justify the additional expense of the shift in computer programs.

"Although economic evaluation in health care has a long-standing tradition in the United Kingdom, very little is known about its impact on decision making, particularly following the introduction of the internal market. Since managed competition appears to be growing in popularity worldwide, the U.K. is an interesting case study, as the reforms are well underway and there have been a number of efforts to conduct and disseminate economic evaluations. In this paper the potential for using economic evaluation in health care decision making in the U.K. is discussed. Then its actual impact is assessed in two ways. First, two case studies are discussed, on heart transplantation and the use of pharmaceuticals in the management of labour in pregnancy. Second, new data from a recent survey of potential users of economic evaluations are presented, with the emphasis on exploring the reasons for the impact, or lack of impact, of economic results. It is concluded that the NHS reforms increase the potential for the use of economic evaluation. However, there is a need to increase decision makers' awareness of economic studies and to help them interpret study methodology and results. Although worries about validity of economic studies are one of the major barriers to their use, other important barriers relate to the multiple objectives being pursued, of which increased efficiency is just one, and the difficulties of freeing resources from existing services in order to divert them to more cost-effective treatments and programmes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(96)00398-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9226783/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To explore pharmacists' perceptions on the use of economic evaluations in decision-making within Medicine Management Committees (MMCs), identify factors that influence the uptake of economic evidence and examine the usefulness of different presentations of economic evidence.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This two-stage qualitative study was carried out in July and August 2004 in two hospitals in northwest England. First, a researcher observed the decision-making process at two MMCs. Handwritten notes were made during observation, which were later transcribed. Subsequently, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of pharmacists involved in the MMCs. The interviews explored pharmacists' views on the usefulness of economic evaluations in decision-making, the factors influencing the uptake of economic evidence by the MMCs, and the optimal presentation of economic results. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. All the transcribed data were thematically analysed using the constant comparison approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In all, six new drug applications were observed and ten pharmacists were interviewed. Pharmacists were observed to play an important role in decisions about drug formularies in hospitals. Although interviewees considered that timely economic evaluations would be useful in reviewing new medicines, the actual use of economic evidence in decision-making within MMCs was limited. The barriers to using economic evaluations included pharmacists' lack of initiative to search for and difficulty in understanding economic evaluations, and the perceived availability, credibility and transferability of economic studies. However, the main barrier to implementing economic evidence was the decision makers' concern about the impact of the medicines on the hospitals' drug budgets. Interviewees felt that they understood and trusted disaggregated economic results better than aggregated ones.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study found the use of economic evidence in decision-making at both MMCs was limited. To improve the usefulness of economic evaluations in MMCs, members of MMCs will need more training in accessing, understanding and appraising economic evidence; researchers need to improve the credibility and transferability of economic studies, and present the results in clear and understandable ways. However, due to the restricted focus of local, short-term drug budgets, evidence-based decision-making remains a challenge for local MMCs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-007-9125-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17566869/,economics
"Product vendors and manufacturers are increasingly aware that purchasers of health care will fund new clinical treatments only if they are perceived to deliver value-for-money. This influences companies' internal commercial decisions, including the price they set for their products. Other things being equal, there is a price threshold, which is the maximum price at which the device will be funded and which, if its value were known, would play a central role in price determination. This paper examines the problem of pricing a medical device from the vendor's point of view in the presence of uncertainty about what the price threshold will be. A formal solution is obtained by maximising the expected value of the net revenue function, assuming a Bayesian prior distribution for the price threshold. A least admissible price is identified. The model can also be used as a tool for analysing proposed pricing policies when no formal prior specification of uncertainty is available.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1807,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22021085/,economics
"This article examines costs as they relate to the financial costs of providing drug abuse treatment in private and public health plans, costs to society relating to drug abuse, and many smaller costing studies of various stakeholders in the health care system. A bibliography is developed from searches across PubMed, Web of Science, and other bibliographic sources. The review indicates that a wide collection of cost findings is available to policy makers. For example, the financial aspects of health plans have been dominated by considerations of actuarial costs of parity for drug abuse treatment. Cost-of-illness methods have been developed and extended to drug abuse costing to measure the national level of burden and are important to the economic evaluation of interventions at the program level. Costing is done in many small and focused studies, reflecting the interests of different stakeholders in the health care system. For costs in programs and health plans, as well as cost offsets of the impact of substance abuse treatment on medical expenditures, findings are surprisingly important to policy makers. Maintaining ongoing research that is highly policy relevant from the point of view of health services, more is needed on costing concepts and measurement applications.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2007.04.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17596904/,economics
"Traditional cost systems cause cost distortions because they cannot meet the requirements of today's businesses. Therefore, a new and more effective cost system is needed. Consequently, time-driven activity-based costing system has emerged. The unit cost of supplying capacity and the time needed to perform an activity are the only 2 factors considered by the system. Furthermore, this system determines unused capacity by considering practical capacity. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the efficiency of the time-driven activity-based costing system and to display how it can be applied in a health care institution. A case study was conducted in a private hospital in Cyprus. Interviews and direct observations were used to collect the data. The case study revealed that the cost of unused capacity is allocated to both open and laparoscopic (closed) surgeries. Thus, by using the time-driven activity-based costing system, managers should eliminate the cost of unused capacity so as to obtain better results. Based on the results of the study, hospital management is better able to understand the costs of different surgeries. In addition, managers can easily notice the cost of unused capacity and decide how many employees to be dismissed or directed to other productive areas.",https://doi.org/10.1097/hcm.0b013e31827ed898,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23364414/,economics

Complex social networks have received increasing attention from researchers. Recent work has focused on mechanisms that produce scale-free networks. We theoretically and empirically characterize the buyer-supplier network of the US economy and find that purely scale-free models have trouble matching key attributes of the network. We construct an alternative model that incorporates realistic features of firms' buyer-supplier relationships and estimate the model's parameters using microdata on firms' self-reported customers. This alternative framework is better able to match the attributes of the actual economic network and aids in further understanding several important economic phenomena.,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1015564108,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21402924/,economics
"This paper describes three prototypical systems of therapeutic reference pricing (RP) for pharmaceuticals--Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand--and examines their effects on the availability of new drugs, reimbursement levels, manufacturer prices, and out-of-pocket surcharges to patients. RP for pharmaceuticals is not simply analogous to a defined contribution approach to subsidizing insurance coverage. Although a major purpose of RP is to stimulate competition, theory suggests that the achievement of this goal is unlikely, and this is confirmed by the empirical evidence. Other effects of RP differ across countries in predictable ways, reflecting each country's system design and other cost-control policies. New Zealand's RP system has reduced reimbursement and limited the availability of new drugs, particularly more expensive drugs. Compared to these three countries, if RP were applied in the United States, it would likely have a more negative effect on prices of onpatent products because of the more competitive U.S. generic market, and on research and development (R&D) and the future supply of new drugs, because of the much larger U.S. share of global pharmaceutical sales.",https://doi.org/10.2202/1558-9544.1050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15612334/,economics
"Economic analysis is a method for allocating resources among competing alternatives. Four techniques commonly used in an economic analysis are cost-minimization analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and cost-utility analysis. These analyses provide information to guide medical decisions and to set funding priorities. Understanding the differences between the techniques allows for better decision making. Although economic analysis is used widely in other fields of medicine, its use in studies of disorders of the hand has been sparse. Only recently has economic analysis been included in studies focused on the care of the upper-extremity patient. As such, to interpret the results of these studies better, hand surgeons need to understand the similarities and differences and the strengths and weaknesses of the different techniques. Such an understanding will allow hand surgeons to know when economic analyses are comparable. Furthermore it will aid them in providing their patients not only medically sound care, but also economically efficient care. This article provides a synopsis of the most widely used and accepted techniques for performing an economic analysis. The key concepts of each of the 4 techniques are shown by using the small number of studies that are available in the upper-extremity literature.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.02.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16632063/,economics
"In recent years there has been a large increase in the number of economic evaluations of pharmaceuticals. Many of these studies have been commissioned by individual pharmaceutical companies, in support of new or existing products. In 2 countries, Australia and Canada (in the province of Ontario), draft guidelines issued by the government have outlined the requirements for economic evaluations to be submitted in support of requests for reimbursement (government subsidy) of particular products. One consequence of the guidelines is that they clarify what is required, and in specifying the procedure for submission of dossiers, identify a clear audience for the economic evaluation. In contrast, the situation in Europe is diverse. A wide range of healthcare systems exist, including national health services and more liberal systems, involving a wide range of insurers and providers. European countries also differ widely in their approach to the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals. Because of this diversity, the nature, conduct and impact of economic evaluation in Europe is not clear. It is therefore difficult for pharmaceutical companies to develop appropriate strategies for economic evaluation and for analysts to decide on appropriate study methodology. This article reviews the nature of any official guidance or requirements for economic evaluation, the potential for use of economic evaluation, the range of studies carried out and the identifiable impacts. There is currently no official guidance in any country, although some countries are considering issuing guidelines. In some countries there is official encouragement to pharmaceutical companies to undertake studies, and where economic data have been presented they have been considered by the relevant committees. The potential uses of economic evaluation vary widely from country to country. These can be classified in terms of a potential role in undertaking national price negotiations, deciding on reimbursement status or copayment level, deciding on inclusion in local formularies or in treatment guidelines, or in improving prescribing decisions. Approximately 80 economic evaluations of pharmaceutical products have been conducted to date in Europe, covering a wide range of clinical areas. There are relatively few examples of identifiable effects of such studies. In part this is because it is often difficult to assess the part played by various items of data. Nevertheless, the overriding conclusion is that economic evaluation of medicines is likely to be more relevant in Europe in the future. The problem for the pharmaceutical industry is in determining when and how.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199304030-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10146921/,economics
"The objective of this article is to examine the impact of economic evaluation on the reimbursement process for pharmaceuticals. The changes in the structure of reimbursement policies necessary to incorporate economic evaluation have been accomplished without major difficulty in most jurisdictions. However, several methodological differences in international guidelines for economic evaluation exist, only some of which can easily be justified. A number of beneficial changes in reimbursement processes have also been observed, such as a trend toward requiring the measurement of more meaningful clinical end points and increased engagement between manufacturers, drug regulators, and payers. A consistent finding in studies of reimbursement decisions is that economic considerations have been influential, second only to the strength of the clinical evidence for the drug of interest. The impact of economic evaluation on the allocation of health care resources is hard to ascertain because little is known about the extent to which reimbursement decisions actually lead to changes in health care practice. However, there is evidence that economic evaluation has assisted price negotiations and enabled reimbursement agencies to target drugs to those patients who will benefit the most.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2373148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23974475/,economics
"Health care economic analyses are becoming increasingly important as health care costs consume an increasing proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP). Among the different forms of health care economic analysis are (1) cost-minimization analysis, (2) cost-benefit analysis, (3) cost-effectiveness analysis, and (4) cost-utility analysis.

"Aims:
        
      
      To assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative smoking cessation scenarios from the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service (NHS).
    


          Design:
        
      
      We used the European study on Quantifying Utility of Investment in Protection from Tobacco model (EQUIPTMOD), a Markov-based state transition economic model, to estimate the return on investment (ROI) of: (a) the current provision of smoking cessation services (brief physician advice and printed self-helped material + smoking ban and tobacco duty at current levels); and (b) four alternative scenarios to complement the current provision: coverage of proactive telephone calls; nicotine replacement therapy (mono and combo) [prescription nicotine replacement therapy (Rx NRT)]; varenicline (standard duration); or bupropion. A rate of 3% was used to discount life-time costs and benefits.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Spain.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Adult smoking population (16+ years).
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Health-care costs associated with treatment of smoking attributable diseases (lung cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary infection and stroke); intervention costs; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were summarized using various ROI estimates.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The cost of implementing the current provision of smoking cessation services is approximately €61 million in the current year. This translates to 18 quitters per 1000 smokers and a life-time benefit-cost ratio of 5, compared with no such provision. All alternative scenarios were dominant (cost-saving: less expensive to run and generated more QALYs) from the life-time perspective, compared with the current provision. The life-time benefit-cost ratios were: 1.87 (proactive telephone calls); 1.17 (Rx NRT); 2.40 (varenicline-standard duration); and bupropion (2.18). The results remained robust in the sensitivity analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      According to the EQUIPTMOD modelling tool it would be cost-effective for the Spanish authorities to expand the reach of existing GP brief interventions for smoking cessation, provide pro-active telephone support, and reimburse smoking cessation medication to smokers trying to stop. Such policies would more than pay for themselves in the long run.",https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29532966/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To explore the variance of unit costs of hospital medical services due to different costing methods employed in the analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective and descriptive study at Kaengkhoi District Hospital, Saraburi Province, Thailand, in the fiscal year 2002. The process started with a calculation of unit costs of medical services as a base case. After that, the unit costs were re-calculated based on various methods. Finally, the variations of the results obtained from various methods and the base case were computed and compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total annualized capital cost of buildings and capital items calculated by the accounting-based approach (averaging the capital purchase prices throughout their useful life) was 13.02% lower than that calculated by the economic-based approach (combination of depreciation cost and interest on undepreciated portion over the useful life). A change of discount rate from 3% to 6% results in a 4.76% increase of the hospital's total annualized capital cost. When the useful life of durable goods was changed from 5 to 10 years, the total annualized capital cost of the hospital decreased by 17.28% from that of the base case. Regarding alternative criteria of indirect cost allocation, unit cost of medical services changed by a range of -6.99% to +4.05%. We explored the effect on unit cost of medical services in one department. Various costing methods, including departmental allocation methods, ranged between -85% and +32% against those of the base case. Based on the variation analysis, the economic-based approach was suitable for capital cost calculation. For the useful life of capital items, appropriate duration should be studied and standardized. Regarding allocation criteria, single-output criteria might be more efficient than the combined-output and complicated ones. For the departmental allocation methods, micro-costing method was the most suitable method at the time of study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These different costing methods should be standardized and developed as guidelines since they could affect implementation of the national health insurance scheme and health financing management.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01815.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17445147/,economics
"Value-based medicine is the practice of medicine emphasizing the value received from an intervention. Value is measured by objectively quantifying: 1) the improvement in quality of life and/or 2) the improvement in length of life conferred by an intervention. Evidence-based medicine often measures the improvement gained in length of life, but generally ignores the importance of quality of life improvement or loss. Value-based medicine incorporates the best features of evidence-based medicine and takes evidence-based data to a higher level by incorporating the quality of life perceptions of patients with a disease in concerning the value of an intervention. Inherent in value-based medicine are the costs associated with an intervention. The resources expended for the value gained in value-based medicine is measured with cost-utility analysis in terms of the US dollars/QALY (money spent per quality-adjusted life-year gained).

"Arrow wrote his classic article in simpler times, as those who chance upon this article forty years hence will say of today. It was a new era in science and medicine, soon to be fueled by new resources from Medicare and the National Institutes of Health. Fiscal constraint was a stranger, physicians were in short supply, and information asymmetry was pervasive. In the intervening years, Americans have become more comfortable with health care issues. Fatal illness, which was rarely discussed with patients in 1960, is now researched by them on the Internet, and greater attention is paid to patient rights. Nonetheless, concerns about quality have, if anything, increased. Indeed, it is public concern about quality that has invited governmental regulation and induced a defensive posture among medical organizations, which are rushing to establish their own instruments of quality, and it is these same public concerns that have facilitated the ability of managed care to offer itself as the guarantor of quality. However, center stage is now held by another issue: health care costs. As a result, the focus has shifted from resolving information asymmetry by enhancing quality to controlling national health expenditures by changing the size and composition of the health care workforce. Licensure, which was restrictive in 1960, is more relaxed today, thereby reducing the entry barriers for the NPC disciplines, several of which were just beginning when Arrow wrote his article. The entry of NPCs into the realm of physician's services partially counterbalances the constraints that have been placed on physician supply, although the major contributions of NPCs are skewed to the primary care end of the spectrum while the major constraints on physician supply affect specialists. The growing presence of NPCs creates a dynamic market in which practitioners in various disciplines both compete and collaborate. It is, in fact, the perfect market that Arrow reluctantly longed for, in which providers who have different levels of skill offer their services at varying prices. But consumers have little upon which to base their choices. And while many of the services offered by NPCs replace physician services at a lower price, others represent additional services, which add to aggregate spending. Arrow sought to explain how a market replete with uncertainty could function. He saw that licensure, entry rationing, and educational subsidies could work to enhance quality, but they did so at the expense of the market. The market has seen it differently and has usurped these tools for its own purposes, leaving quality to look for other sponsors. Has it done so wisely? We have yet to see how well a multidisciplinary workforce of autonomous providers will function, but both successes and failures abound. What is more apparent is how entry rationing and restrictions on educational subsidies have capped the supply of physicians and limited the production of specialists at a time when there is increasing demand for their services. Arrow identified potent tools for affecting the characteristics of the health care workforce. They now must be redirected to the needs of the future.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-26-5-925,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11765272/,economics
"Monetary financing - the funding of state expenditure via the creation of new money rather than through taxation or borrowing - has become a taboo policy instrument in advanced economies. It is generally associated with dangerously high inflation and/or war. Relatedly, a key institutional feature of modern independent central banks is that they are not obligated to support government expenditure via money creation. Since the financial crisis of 2007-2008, however, unorthodox monetary policies, in particular quantitative easing, coupled with stagnant growth and high levels of public and private debt have led to questions over the monetary financing taboo. Debates on the topic have so far been mainly theoretical with little attention to the social and political dynamics of historical instances of monetary financing. This paper analyses one of the most significant twentieth-century cases: Canada from the period after the Great Depression up until the monetarist revolution of the 1970s. The period was a successful one for the Canadian economy, with high growth and employment and manageable inflation. It offers some interesting insights into the relationship between states and central banks and present-day discussions around the governance of money creation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12278,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28783229/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Economic evaluations in healthcare are designed to inform decisions by the estimation of cost and effect trade-off of two or more interventions. This review identified and appraised the quality of reporting of economic evaluations in plastic surgery based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Ovid Health Star, and Business Source Complete from January 1, 2012 to November 30, 2019. Data extracted included: the type of economic evaluation (i.e., cost-utility analysis (CUA), cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), cost-minimization analysis (CMA)), domain of plastic surgery, journal, year, and country of publication. The CHEERS checklist (with 24 items) was used to appraise the quality of reporting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-two economic evaluations were identified; CUA (10%), CEA (31%), CBA (4%), and CMA (50%). Breast surgery was the top domain (48%). Most were conducted in the USA (61%) and published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery journal (28%). One-third were published in the last two years. The average CHEERS checklist compliance score was 15 (63%). The average CHEERS checklist compliance score per type of evaluation was 19 (77%) for CUA, 17 (70%) for CEA, 13 (52%) for CBA, and 14 (57%) for CMA. The least reported CHEERS checklist items included: time horizon (15%), discount rate (18%), and assessment of heterogeneity (15%). Thirty-two percent of studies were inappropriately titled (i.e., methodologically incorrect).

"The economic consequences of the approximately 500,000 strokes that occur each year in the US are staggering. The direct cost of providing care for stroke victims in 1993 has been estimated to be $US17 billion, with an additional $US13 billion in indirect costs attributable to lost earnings due to stroke-related mortality and morbidity. Estimates of the cost of stroke over a patient's lifetime vary according to age at first stroke and type of stroke. In 1990, these estimates ranged from $US91,000 for ischaemic stroke, $US124,000 for intracerebral haemorrhage, and $US228,000 for subarachnoid haemorrhage. Factors driving the economics of stroke include the epidemiology of stroke, treatment patterns and settings, and social and behavioural factors. Evaluating the economic consequences of alternative interventions designed to prevent strokes or improve stroke outcomes involves a weighing of incremental costs and effectiveness. Previous efforts have focused primarily on measuring costs, with a recent shift to trying to measure patient preferences for stroke outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00003495-199700543-00008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9360852/,economics
"The ideal market structure would give each medical care organization effective incentives to produce maximum value for money for enrolled subscribers. It should be based on integrated financing and delivery systems--partnerships that link doctors, hospitals and insurers--with per capita prepayment, with providers at risk for cost of care and cost of poor quality, publicly accountable for quality and per capita costs. The ideal market structure must be managed by active intelligent collective purchasing agents, called sponsors, that contract with health care systems and set the rules of competition. Sponsors structure and manage the enrollment process; they create price-elastic demand; they manage risk selection; and they create and administer equitable rules of coverage.

"The imperfect risk adjustment of prospective payment for hospitals may have dramatic consequences on equity. If the hospital is able to distinguish subgroups of patients with different expected costs within a group for which the risk-adjusted payment per admission is the same, it is likely to select the most profitable cases and deny care to the others. Meanwhile, hospitals refusing to practice patients' selection may experience solvency problems. In the long term, either those hospitals fail and access to care is at risk, or they decrease the quality of treatments and access to quality is at risk. In Belgium, since 1995, a prospective payment per case has replaced the traditional per diem payments for non-medical expenditures. A fixed number of days are paid to each admission, based on the patient's characteristics, namely diagnosis, age and geriatric profile. In this paper, we examine the imperfect risk adjustment related to the non-inclusion of socio-economic factors in the hospital financing formula. Using data from 61 Belgian hospitals from 1995, we observe that socio-economic status, which is currently not accounted for as risk adjuster, has a significant impact on length of stay (LOS). We estimate that patients in the upper-income categories, patients with a self-employed status and patients with an employee status are beneficial for hospitals' financial results, due to their shorter stays. On the contrary, the non-active, the low-income patients and patients benefiting from an insurance preferential regime represent, on average, a financial loss for hospitals. Finally, we find that financial results under the current financing scheme are biased due to the non-inclusion of SES risk-adjustors. Hospitals with the most beneficial social case-mix are shown to experience a shift from a positive to a negative financial outcome when SES risk adjustors are included, while the reverse is observed for hospitals with the worst social case-mix.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.07.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17888552/,economics

HCRA was expected to encourage price competition which in turn was anticipated to lower hospital revenues and expenses. We measured the differential effects on hospital revenues and expenses in markets with varying degrees of competition. We also measured the relationship between hospital revenues and expenses and the increased concentration resulting from the formation of local hospital systems. We found that revenues and expenses both grew more slowly for hospitals located in more competitive markets; hospital systems that increased concentration tended to have higher revenues. In the short run at least, price competition induced by HCRA did constrain both hospital expense and revenue growth, although the increase in hospital mergers countered this trend.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_42.2.183,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16196315/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Chronic, noncommunicable diseases are on the rise globally, with tobacco consumption being an important contributing risk factor. These increases result in significant economic costs due to increased healthcare costs, productive lives lost, and productive days lost due to illness. Estimates of these economic costs are scarce in low- and middle-income countries.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Drawing on a diverse range of data sources, direct healthcare costs, and productivity losses due to illness and premature deaths were estimated using the cost-of-illness approach. The present value of lifetime earnings was used to estimate productivity losses from premature deaths.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We estimate that 25 708 deaths among persons aged 35-74 in 2016 are smoking-attributable. The economic cost of smoking was R42 billion (US$2.88 billion), of which R14.48 billion was for healthcare costs (hospitalization and outpatient department visits). The economic cost of smoking amounted to 0.97% of the South African GDP in 2016, while the healthcare cost of smoking-related diseases was 4.1% of total South African health expenditure. The costs are lower for women because of their lower smoking prevalence.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The economic burden of smoking calls for a further scaling-up of tobacco-control interventions in South Africa.

      This article addresses the paucity of research on the detailed economic costs of smoking in low-and middle-income countries, including South Africa. Our calculations, based on an extensive range of recent data, provide the most detailed estimate to date and include quantification of the direct and indirect costs of smoking in South Africa. We found that the magnitude of the costs related to smoking in South Africa is larger than in the previous estimates and that for every Rand received in the form of cigarette tax, society loses 3.43 Rands. This article provides an economic case for evidence-based tobacco control in South Africa.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32832993/,economics
"This paper is an evaluative survey of the economic literature on the relationship between technology and/or innovation and health expenditures. Various types of analysis viz. econometric modelling; three residual approaches; the cost-of-illness approach; and the literature on supplier interests are contrasted, and the results presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy and planning implications, and a simple, and conventional, proposal is made that could unambiguously determine this relationship in the case of process innovations.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.4740010403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10311981/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To examine evidence on the economic impact of electronic prescribing (EP) systems in the hospital setting.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, the European Network of Health Economic Evaluation Database and Web of Science from inception to October 2013. Full and partial economic evaluations of EP or computerized provider order entry were included. We excluded studies assessing prescribing packages for specific drugs, and monetary outcomes that were not related to medicines. A checklist was used to evaluate risk of bias and evidence quality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search yielded 1160 articles of which three met the inclusion criteria. Two were full economic evaluations and one a partial economic evaluation. A meta-analysis was not appropriate as studies were heterogeneous in design, economic evaluation method, interventions and outcome measures. Two studies investigated the financial impact of reducing preventable adverse drug events. The third measured savings related to various aspects of the system including those related to medication. Two studies reported positive financial effects. However the overall quality of the economic evidence was low and key details often not reported.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      There seems to be some evidence of financial benefits of EP in the hospital setting. However, it is not clear if evidence is transferable to other settings. Research is scarce and limited in quality, and reported methods are not always transparent. Further robust, high quality research is required to establish if hospital EP is cost effective and thus inform policy makers' decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.11.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26878756/,economics
"Several impediments have delayed the adoption of filmless imaging by the majority of radiology practitioners. These factors include concerns for technology obsolescence, limited available capital, and lack of existing information technology (IT) infrastructure and experienced personnel. Application service providers (ASPs) have begun to emerge as an alternative approach to the more traditional acquisition of picture archiving and communication (PAC) systems. This approach offers the prospective PACS customer the opportunity to outsource hardware, software, and IT services to a vendor on a fee-per-use basis. The ideal candidates for such an approach would be small to medium-sized hospitals with limited existing IT infrastructure. Using the ASP model, prospective PACS customers can purchase services unique to their needs and upgrade or expand these as needed. As ASP vendors increase their customer base, there is the potential for customers to achieve unique economies of scale not available through traditional financing means. This report discusses the economic and operational issues associated with ASPs, as well as potential limitations and future implications of this phenomenon.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10278-001-0017-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11310909/,economics
"This article explains the origins, development, and passage of the single most influential postwar innovation in medical financing: Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS). Inexorably rising medical inflation and deep economic deterioration forced policymakers in the late 1970s to pursue radical reform of Medicare to keep the program from insolvency. Congress and the Reagan administration eventually turned to the one alternative reimbursement system that analysts and academics had studied more than any other and had even tested with apparent success in New Jersey: prospective payment with diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Rather than simply reimbursing hospitals whatever costs they charged to treat Medicare patients, the new model paid hospitals a predetermined, set rate based on the patient's diagnosis. The most significant change in health policy since Medicare and Medicaid's passage in 1965 went virtually unnoticed by the general public. Nevertheless, the change was nothing short of revolutionary. For the first time, the federal government gained the upper hand in its financial relationship with the hospital industry. Medicare's new prospective payment system with DRGs triggered a shift in the balance of political and economic power between the providers of medical care (hospitals and physicians) and those who paid for it--power that providers had successfully accumulated for more than half a century.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jhmas/jrj038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16467485/,economics
"This study aims to evaluate the General Health Insurance System (GHIS) in Turkey implemented since 1 October 2008, in order to assess whether the GHIS will be able to achieve its objective of universal coverage. Both the breadth and depth of coverage will be taken into account. The study notes out that some socio-economic problems, such as a significant informal economy, high unemployment rate, inefficiency in the creation of adequate employment opportunities, inequitable income distribution, and widespread poverty, are the main problems preventing the GHIS from reaching breadth of coverage in Turkey. Contribution conditions for entitlement to health services prevent the GHIS from providing breadth of coverage too. Outof- pocket payments, which are higher than in European and OECD countries, narrow the depth of coverage, but the GHIS brings additional user fees. Statistics show that despite its objective, the GHIS struggles to provide universal coverage. It seems the GHIS will not be able to provide universal coverage in the near future because of the socio-economic conditions and conditions for entitlement to health services. In this case the government will either introduce radical arrangements to cope with the socio-economic problems and issues with the funding system or should consider switching from an insurance-based system towards a tax-based system.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.1079,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21913355/,economics
"Although the rapid increase in Medicaid managed care during the early 1990s attracted commercial plans to the program, by the late 1990s commercial plan participation in Medicaid had begun to decline. This study examines the role of Medicaid policies, plan characteristics, and local health care market conditions in a commercial plan's decision to exit. We find that many of the factors that influence commercial plans' decisions to exit Medicaid are within the control of state policymakers and program administrators, including capitation rates, service carve-outs, mandatory enrollment policies, and the number of Medicaid enrollees and areas served by the plan.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.24.4.1084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16012149/,economics
"The traditional view of hospital competition has posited that hospitals compete primarily along 'quality' dimensions, in the form of fancy equipment to attract admitting physicians and pleasant surroundings to entice patients. Price competition among hospitals is thought to be non-existent. This paper estimates the effects of various hospital market characteristics on hospital prices and expenses in an attempt to determine the form of hospital competition. The results suggest that both price and quality competition are greater in markets that are less concentrated, although the net effect of the two on prices is insignificant. It appears, therefore, that, despite important distortions, hospital markets are not immune to standard competitive forces.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(88)90028-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10291477/,economics
"In 1991, Zimbabwe introduced cost recovery measures as part of its programme of economic reforms, following a course taken by many developing countries. The system of user fees in public health care, aimed to 'protect and support the vulnerable groups' by exemption or incremental fees based on 4 income brackets. Drugs were charged at a percentage of the recommended retail price in the private sector. This study of 488 outpatients at a referral hospital in Harare examined how the new fee system functioned 6 months after its introduction. Patients were interviewed and their prescription records examined. Mean charges were determined for each fee category and revenue from drug charges was analyzed in relation to purchase cost to determine the gross profit. 31% of patients were exempted from all fees upon proof of monthly earnings of less than Z$150 (Z$5 = US$1). The remainder were classified into three fee-paying categories. The mean purchase cost for drug items was Z$3.89 per outpatient prescription. Outpatients paid a mean drug charge of Z$9.75 after exemption or discount. This was 2.5 times the cost price. The number of drug items obtained differed according to fee status: the fee-exempt category received a mean of 2.9 drug items compared with 1.9 drug items in the fee-paying categories. This difference originated at the point of prescribing. A number of practical problems in fee collection were noted. The drug pricing system generated high profit even after re-distribution to low-income users. This was attributed to economical and rationalized public sector drug procurement. Observation indicated that a proportion of the vulnerable were not effectively protected due to stringent requirements for proof of income. Appraisal of the fee policy indicated the need for more effective cross-subsidy and better administrative procedures; fee revenue should be directed towards improvement in quality of service.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/10.3.319,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10151850/,economics
"This paper presents a review of the Chinese pharmaceutical policy in order to analyse the forms of effective market competition introduced or not in the system. Registration, pricing and trade are three areas showing the limits on competition. The government limits the duration of the registration procedure to three years, which leaves some opportunities for challengers to market similar products afterwards. The pricing system in place is a maximum price ceiling. The price structure reveals a net difference of treatment between foreign products and domestic products. With respect to trading policy, the government applies a selective licensing policy for exports and imposes variable custom taxes on a product-by-product basis on imports. At a micro level, the Chinese market has instant market conditions with fair trade where manufacturers, importers and distributors can meet. Different cost-sharing experiments between the state, the working units and the patients also introduce more sensitivity to prices from the consumer. Such a duality between the limits imposed on competition by public policy tools and the experiments or market conditions in place at the level of the organisations underlines the ambiguity of the move towards a market economy in the Chinese pharmaceutical market.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(94)90054-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10138727/,economics
"We study the risk-selection and cost-shifting behavior of physicians in a unique capitation payment model in Ontario, using the incentive to enroll and care for complex and vulnerable patients as a case study. This incentive, which is incremental to the regular capitation payment, ceases after the first year of patient enrollment and may therefore impact on the physician's decision to continue to enroll the patient. Furthermore, because the enrolled patients in Ontario can seek care from any provider, the enrolling physician may shift some treatment costs to other providers. Using longitudinal administrative data and a control group of physicians in the fee-for-service model who were eligible for the same incentive, we find no evidence of either patient 'dumping' or cost shifting. These results highlight the need to re-examine the conventional wisdom about risk selection for physician payment models that significantly deviate from the stylized capitation model.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.10.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24210763/,economics
"We forecast a slowdown in national health spending growth in 2002 and 2003, reflecting slower projected Medicare and private personal health spending growth. These factors outweigh higher projected Medicaid spending growth, caused by weak labor markets, and an expectation of continued high private health insurance premium inflation related to the underwriting cycle. Over the entire projection period, national health spending growth is still expected to outpace economic growth. The result is that the health share of gross domestic product is projected to increase from 14.1 percent in 2001 to 17.7 percent in 2012.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w3.54,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14527235/,economics
"The claim that managed care plans are more efficient than fee-for-service plans has been made so often that it has reached the status of folklore, but the evidence is inconclusive. The claim is usually based on one or both of the following errors: (1) lower medical care costs mean lower total costs (medical plus administrative costs) and (2) lower HMO premiums mean HMOs are more efficient than fee-for-service plans. The first assertion ignores evidence indicating that managed care has driven up administrative costs for both insurers and providers. The second ignores evidence that managed care plans have numerous methods of shifting costs that are unavailable or less available to fee-for-service plans. The lull in health care inflation during the mid-1990s is often cited as evidence that managed care is efficient. But the lull may have been caused not by the spread of managed care but by the near-simultaneous occurrence of four events: a downturn in the insurance underwriting cycle, the 1990-1991 recession, endorsement of managed competition by numerous politicians, and the merger fever triggered by those endorsements.",https://doi.org/10.2190/mpv6-f4gm-yry8-vaw0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11271648/,economics
"Economic analysis of life-saving investments in both the public and private sectors has the potential to dramatically improve longevity and the quality of life, but only if the analyses on which decisions are based are done well. In this article, we analyze a data set that provides information on the content and quality of journal articles that measure the cost-effectiveness of life-saving investments. Our study is the first to provide a detailed multivariate analysis of factors affecting objective measures of quality. We also explore whether a series of recommendations by an expert panel convened by the U.S. Public Health Service affect the way analyses of specific life-saving investments are done. Our results suggest that four factors are positively correlated with an index we construct to measure analytical quality: (1) having at least one author affiliated with a university, (2) publication in a journal that has experience in publishing these analyses, (3) if the life-saving investment is located in the United States, and (4) if the analysis considers a measure of social costs or benefits. Somewhat surprisingly, a study's funding source and whether it is affiliated with industry are not significantly correlated with the quality index.

"Objectives:
        
      
      This study is an attempt to demystify and clarify the idea of cost in health economics and health technology assessment (HTA).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Its method draws on standard concepts in economics. Cost is a more elusive concept than is commonly thought and can be particularly elusive in multidisciplinary territory like HTA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The article explains that cost is more completely defined as opportunity cost, why cost is necessarily associated with a decision, and that it will always vary according to the context of that decision: whether choice is about inputs or outputs, what the alternatives are, the timing of the consequences of the decision, the nature of the commitment to which a decision maker is committed, who the decision maker is, and the constraints and discretion limiting or liberating the decision maker. Distinctions between short and long runs and between fixed and variable inputs are matters of choice, not technology, and are similarly context-dependent. Harms or negative consequences are, in general, not costs. Whether so-called ""clinically unrelated"" future costs and benefits should be counted in current decisions again depends on context.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The costs of entire health programs are context-dependent, relating to planned rates of activity, volumes, and timings. The implications for the methods of HTA are different in the contexts of low- and middle-income countries compared with high-income countries, and further differ contextually according to the budget constraints (fixed or variable) facing decision makers.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462318000612,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30326982/,economics
"In this work, the conceptual designs of the established Organosolv process and a novel biphasic, so-called Organocat process are developed and analyzed. Solvent recycling and energy integration are emphasized to properly assess economic viability. Both processes show a similar energy consumption (approximately 5 MJ/kg(dry biomass)). However, they still show a lack of economic attractiveness even at larger scale. The Organocat process is more favorable due to more efficient lignin separation. The analysis uncovers the remaining challenges toward an economically viable design. They largely originate from by-products formation, product isolation, and solvent recycling. Necessary improvements in process chemistry, equipment design, energy efficiency and process design are discussed to establish economically attractive Organosolv-like processes of moderate capacity as a building block of a future biorefinery.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.09.078,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24157680/,economics

"Epileptic seizures are associated with significant morbidity, impaired quality of life, mortality and substantial healthcare costs. Treatment with anti-epileptic drugs is the mainstay of therapy, with pharmacotherapy aiming to achieve seizure freedom or seizure reduction. Given that approximately 30% of patients are not controlled with monotherapy regimens, adjunctive therapy with multiple anti-epileptic drugs can be envisaged. This article aims to review economic evaluations of anti-epileptic drugs as adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy in adult patients. Studies were included if they examined the costs and consequences of different pharmacotherapeutic adjunctive therapies for refractory epilepsy. Uncertainty surrounds the cost-effectiveness of anti-epileptic drugs as adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy owing to methodological limitations and design differences between studies. Although cost-effectiveness estimates vary between studies, adjunctive therapy of refractory epilepsy appears to be cost effective, depending on the cost-effectiveness threshold used by pricing/reimbursement agencies. However, there is a need for more, better-designed and comprehensive economic evaluations of adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy with anti-epileptic drugs.",https://doi.org/10.1586/erp.10.18,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20545595/,economics

"Health insurance does not insure health. It reimburses the costs of health care, and enables potential users of care to pool their risks. But public health insurance is qualitatively different from private, in that risk pooling is not its only or even its primary function. Public systems also redistribute, deliberately, from low to high risk individuals. Perhaps even more important, public insurance is a mechanism for the collective purchase of care. It enables buyers, through their political representatives, to bargain with providers over both price and quantity of care, and thus to control overall system costs, in a way that individual patients cannot. This paper contrasts the experience of public insurance in Canada with private coverage in the U.S., to show how universal public coverage, used as a 'collective purchasing agency', has led to both better coverage and lower costs. Current policy changes in the U.S., described as 'competitive', are in fact efforts to create private collective purchasing agencies to bargain with providers on behalf of individuals. Yet economic analysis has been largely incapable of grasping this process, continuing to treat public and private insurance alike as simply reductions in the price of care faced by individual consumers, and thus generating erroneous predictions and analyses of the behaviour of public systems. It has encouraged a fruitless concern with the prices faced by patients, while ignoring the overwhelming significance of the structure and objectives of the insurer. This failure may be traceable to fundamental flaws in the concept of a transactor in economic theory.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(87)90026-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10312072/,economics
"During economic doldrums, decision making on investments for safety is even more difficult than it already is when funds are abundant. This paper attempts to offer some guidance. After stating the present challenge to prevention of losses in the process industries, the systematic approach of quantified risk assessment is briefly reviewed and improvements in the methodology are mentioned. In addition, attention is given to the use of a risk matrix to survey a plant and to derive a plan of action. Subsequently, the reduction of risk is reviewed. Measures for prevention, protection, and mitigation are discussed. The organization of safety has become at least as important as technical safety of equipment and standards. It is reflected in the introduction of a safety management system. Furthermore, the design process in a pro-active approach is described and the concept of inherent safety is briefly addressed. The concept of Layer of Protection Analysis is explained and also the reason why it is relevant to provide a cost-benefit analysis.

"This paper addresses two seeming paradoxes in the realm of employer-provided health insurance: First, businesses consistently claim that they bear the burden of the insurance they provide for employees, despite theory and empirical evidence indicating that workers bear the full incidence. Second, benefit generosity and the percentage of premiums paid by employers have decreased in recent decades, despite the preferential tax treatment of employer-paid benefits relative to wages-trends unexplained by the standard incidence model. This paper offers a revised incidence model based on nominal wage rigidity, in an attempt to explain these paradoxes. The model predicts that when the nominal wage constraint binds, some of the burden of increasing insurance premiums will fall on firms, particularly small companies with low-wage employees. In response, firms will reduce employment, decrease benefit generosity, and require larger employee premium contributions. Using Current Population Survey data from 2000-2001, I find evidence for this kind of wage rigidity and its associated impact on the employment and premium contributions of low-wage insured workers during a period of rapid premium growth.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-005-6603-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15714265/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      Competition rules maximise consumer welfare by promoting efficient use of scarce resource and thus high output, low prices, high quality, varied services, innovation, production and distribution. European courts consider doctors and hospital staff as undertakings (any entity that performs economic activities), so that if they enter into agreements then they have to comply with competition rules. This paper's objective is to determine whether competition law, which applies to undertakings, can in fact be applied to different healthcare-sector players and whether specific rules are needed regarding competition between healthcare undertakings.
    


          Design/methodology/approach:
        
      
      Data were selected from relevant European and national case law, European institution legal documents (such as regulations, guidelines and communications) and healthcare competition law literature, and then examined.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The paper finds that competition rules are applicable to healthcare players considering the consequences if competition rules are applied to the healthcare market. For market processes to result in the appropriate cost, quality and output, competition law must be proactive. In other words, quality must be fully factored into the competitive mix, allowing consumers to weigh healthcare price and non-price characteristics.
    


          Research limitations/implications:
        
      
      Countries have different healthcare system and competition rules (although similar), competition rule impact is different for each country. Some healthcare systems are more regulated and there will be less opportunity for healthcare players to compete.
    


          Practical implications:
        
      
      Efficiently applying competition law to healthcare players means that several challenges need facing, such as healthcare quality complexity and court scepticism.
    


          Originality/value:

"New evidence on the quality of health care from public services in Niger is discussed in terms of the relationships between quality, costs, cost-effectiveness and financing. Although structural attributes of quality appeared to improve with the pilot project in Niger, significant gaps in the implementation of diagnostic and treatment protocols were observed, particularly in monitoring vital signs, diagnostic examination and provider-patient communications. Quality improvements required significant investments in both fixed and variable costs; however, many of these costs were basic input requirements for operation. It is likely that optimal cost-effectiveness of services was not achieved because of the noted deficiencies in quality. In the test district of Boboye, the revenues from the copayments alone covered about 34% of the costs of medicines or about 20% of costs of drugs and administration. In Say, user fees covered about 50-55% of the costs of medicines or 35-40% of the amount spent on medicines and cost-recovery administration. In Boboye, taxes plus the additional copayments covered 120-180% of the cost of medicines, or 75-105% of the cost of medicines plus administration of cost recovery.

Overall, Australia's expenditure on health is relatively high and, with an increasingly aged population, this expenditure is not likely to decrease. With the current concerns over cost-containment in the health sector it is important to assess the value of nursing care in economic terms. This paper explores the issue of valuing of nursing care within the framework of the Australian Health Care System. Questions are posed of nurses as to whether they are prepared to confront the realities of the health care arena and whether they are ready to value nursing practice in terms of economic value. As well as answering these questions, the paper argues that nursing costs are not sufficiently reimbursed under the current Australian health benefits, and that this poor estimation of the worth of health care may stem from the historical and social influences of nursing and the care provided by nurses. The paper concludes that the Australian health care system is clearly no longer static and that the public cannot afford to support the costs associated with a growing health care industry. Moreover, nursing can no longer afford not to be viewed as an entity in it's own right. A greater awareness of nursing's output will result if organisational or institutional changes are encouraged for the benefit of the Australian society, as a whole, as well as for the nursing profession.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2648.1997.1997025454.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9080270/,economics
"Non-compliance with drug therapies not only limits their effectiveness, but in some instances, is associated with grave clinical sequelae and substantial economic burden. It is important, therefore, to consider non-compliance in economic evaluations. A review of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, which have applied sensitivity analysis to non-compliance rates, was undertaken to evaluate the impact of non-compliance on the cost-effectiveness of different drug therapies. Although 22 evaluations satisfied the inclusion criteria, additional information was obtained from the authors of most studies, as the published details were inadequate. The majority of evaluations assumed altered effectiveness owing to reduced compliance in the absence of supportive clinical evidence. Because of the disparity in the nature of the outcomes, the measures of non-compliance and the time horizon of the studies evaluated, it was not possible to compare the magnitude of the impact of non-compliance among different drug-disease combinations. However, it was evident that non-compliance always results in a reduction in efficacy, but its impact on costs varied substantially. The importance of incorporating measures of compliance is highlighted, as failing to account for 'real world' compliance rates in pharmacoeconomic evaluations may lead to selection of sub-optimal treatment strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.609,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11747044/,economics
"In this study, the authors used simulation to explore factors that might influence hospitals' decisions to adopt evidence-based interventions. Specifically, they developed a simulation model to examine the extent to which hospitals would benefit economically from the transitional care model (TCM). The TCM is designed to transition high-risk older adults from hospitals back to communities using interventions focused on preventing readmissions.The authors used qualitative methods to identify and validate simulation facets. Four simulation experiments explored the economic impact of the TCM on more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals: (1) magnitude of readmission penalty, (2) application to specific diagnosis-related groups, (3) level of cost sharing between payer and provider, and (4) capitated versus fee-for-service payments. The simulator projected hospital-specific economic effects. The authors used Monte Carlo methods for the simulations, which were parameterized with public data sets from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and TCM data from randomized controlled trials and comparative effectiveness studies.Under current conditions, the simulation indicated that only 10 of more than 3,000 Medicare-certified hospitals would benefit financially from the TCM. If current readmission penalties were doubled, the number of hospitals projected to benefit would increase to 300. Targeting selected diagnosis cohorts would also increase the number of hospitals to 300. If payers reimbursed providers for 100% of the TCM costs, 2,000 hospitals would benefit financially. Under a capitated payment model, 1,500 hospitals would benefit from the TCM.Current CMS penalties-or reasonable increases-have little economic effect on the TCM. In the current environment, two strategies are likely to facilitate adoption: (1) persuading payers to reimburse TCM costs and (2) focusing on hospitals with higher bed occupancies and higher revenue patients.",https://doi.org/10.1097/jhm-d-18-00114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31274814/,economics
"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has implemented an inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (IRF-PPS) based on case-mix groups (CMGs).

Although this late change in plans is a major triumph for physical medicine and rehabilitation and for the patients we serve, economic incentives inherent in the IRF-PPS may still transform inpatient rehabilitation as it is currently practiced in the United States.

Using data from hospitals in 1972 we analyzed the impact of market structure on average hospital costs, measured in terms of both cost per patient and cost per patient day. Under the retrospective reimbursement system in place at the time, hospitals in more competitive environments exhibited significantly higher costs of production than did those in less competitive environments.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(85)90012-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10276358/,economics
"According to economists from the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, the introduction of performance pay for primary and secondary school teachers would lead to an increase in Dutch GDP of one-and-a-half percent in 2070. A new epistemic practice of microeconomic forecasting undergirded this attempt to make the distant future part of the political present. Taking the construction of the economic growth potential of performance pay as a starting point, this article analyzes how microeconomic forecasting emerged in one of the world's oldest forecasting bureaus - and to what consequences. First, it highlights the institutional preconditions for this 'turn to micro' in an institution that had pioneered in the field of macroeconomic forecasting. Second, the article analyzes microeconomic forecasting as a distinct epistemic practice that brings different forms of economic expertise together to make the future of educational reforms commensurable. Finally, it analyzes the political consequences of this new epistemic practice in the sense that it not only enables but simultaneously limits the provision of policy-relevant evidence. Beyond the specificities of the case, the article contributes to the sociological study of economic policy devices against the background of a predominant market bias in the STS research on economics.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312719837364,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30880588/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      When guidelines for health economic evaluations prescribe that a societal perspective should be adopted, productivity costs should be included. However, previous research suggests that, in practice, productivity costs are often neglected. This may considerably bias the results of cost-effectiveness studies, particularly those regarding treatments targeted at diseases with a high incidence rate in the working population, such as depressive disorders.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to, first, investigate whether economic evaluations of treatments for depressive disorders include productivity costs and, if so, how. Second, to investigate how the inclusion or exclusion of productivity costs affects incremental costs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review was performed. Included articles were reviewed to determine (i) whether productivity costs had been included and (ii) whether the studies adhered to national health economic guidelines about the inclusion or exclusion of these costs. For those studies that did include productivity costs, we calculated what proportion of total costs were productivity costs. Subsequently, the incremental costs, excluding productivity costs, were calculated and compared with the incremental costs presented in the original article, to analyse the impact of productivity costs on final results. Regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the level of productivity costs and the type of depressive disorder, the type of treatment and study characteristics such as time horizon used and productivity cost valuation method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 81 unique economic evaluations of treatments for adults with depressive disorders were identified, 24 of which included productivity costs in the numerator and one in the denominator. Approximately 69% of the economic evaluations ignored productivity costs. Two-thirds of the studies complied with national guidelines regarding the inclusion of productivity costs. For the studies that included productivity costs, these costs reflected an average of 60% of total costs per treatment arm. The inclusion or exclusion of productivity costs substantially affected incremental costs in a number of studies. Regression analyses showed that the level of productivity costs was significantly associated with study characteristics such as average age, the methods of data collection regarding work time lost, the values attached to lost work time, the type of depressive disorder, the type of treatment provided and the level of direct costs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Studies that do not include productivity costs may, in many cases, poorly reflect full societal costs (or savings) of an intervention. Furthermore, when comparing total costs reported in studies that include productivity costs, it should be noted that study characteristics such as the methods used to assess productivity costs may affect their level.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11539970-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545189/,economics
"Economics affects everyone and the economic impact of HIV/AIDS will take generations to unfold. Recent macroeconomic predictions have emphasized the concept of human capital, and predicted that much higher costs will be associated with the epidemic than earlier suggestions that economies might simply grow more slowly implied. At a firm or sector level AIDS increases the costs of doing business; impact studies at this level are therefore more important for planning. Impacts at household level are some of the most immediate and devastating, owing to the close relationship between households being affected by HIV/AIDS and subsequent impoverishment. The economic impacts of HIV/AIDS at each level will be modified through prevention and treatment interventions. The potential savings to governments through implementation of a programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission provide some of the most compelling evidence for action. However, health services are suffering under a dual burden of increased demand and reduced capacity to deliver, which contributes to a cycle of poor health and economic decline.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2004.10.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15778110/,economics
"Policymakers are increasingly interested in reducing healthcare costs and inefficiencies through innovative payment strategies. These strategies may have heterogeneous impacts across geographic areas, potentially reducing or exacerbating geographic variation in healthcare spending. In this paper, we exploit a major payment reform for home health care to examine whether reductions in reimbursement lead to differential changes in treatment intensity and provider costs depending on the level of competition in a market. Using Medicare claims, we find that while providers in more competitive markets had higher average costs in the pre-reform period, these markets experienced larger proportional reductions in treatment intensity and costs after the reform relative to less competitive markets. This led to a convergence in spending across geographic areas. We find that much of the reduction in provider costs is driven by greater exit of ""high-cost"" providers in more competitive markets.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.12.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28073062/,economics

"The size of the plastic surgery workforce has important effects on the financial environment of the specialty. Economic theory predicts that increasing the area supply of surgeons performing aesthetic surgery will result in lower fees for their services. This study tested that theory in the actual aesthetic surgery marketplace. The study examined the ratio of plastic surgeons to the general population of several states. It then traced the aesthetic surgery fees resulting from different densities of area plastic surgeons. This information was economically analyzed to project the fee effects of possible future changes in the number of practicing plastic surgeons. For the states of New York, California, and Texas, there is a proportional decrease in fees as the density of plastic surgeons increases. For example, New York has 34 percent more plastic surgeons proportionally than Texas, and its fees are 30 percent lower in real dollars. Economic analysis can project the fee effects of changing the supply of surgeons performing aesthetic surgery. The analysis reveals that a 30 percent national increase in the supply of plastic surgeons would lower fees by approximately 32 percent. Similarly, if the number of plastic surgeons increases by 50 percent, fees will decrease by approximately 53 percent. However, these fee effects can be mitigated by expanding the demand for aesthetic surgery. In conclusion, the size of the plastic surgery workforce has profound effects on the fees paid for aesthetic surgery, and the magnitude of these effects can be understood, predicted, and optimized using the tools of economics.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00006534-199908000-00043,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10654705/,economics
"Ireland's private health insurance market provides primarily supplementary health insurance for hospital services, operating alongside a public hospital system to which residents have universal access entitlements, subject to some copayments for those without a medical card. The State subsidises the purchase of private health insurance through measures including tax relief on premiums and not charging the full economic cost for private beds in public hospitals. Furthermore, privately insured patients occupying public beds in public hospitals did not, until 2014, incur charges for such accommodation, apart from modest statutory charges. In the Budget in October 2013, a number of measures were announced that began to unwind these subsidies. Although it was initially feared that these measures would add to premium inflation, leading in turn to further discontinuation of health insurance, the evidence suggests that premium inflation has eased and take-up has stabilised, although some of this may have been due to the introduction of lifetime community rating in May 2015. Nevertheless, it would appear that the restriction on the subsidisation of private health insurance has not had a significant adverse effect on the market, while it has reduced an inequitable cross-subsidy.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2015.08.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26321146/,economics

"The market for new drugs is changing: personalised drugs will increase the heterogeneity in patients' responses and, possibly, costs. In this context, price regulation will play an increasingly important role. In this article, we argue that personalised medicine opens new scenarios in the relationship between value-based prices, regulation and industry listing strategies. Our focus is on the role of asymmetry of information and competition. We show that, if the firm has more information than the payer on the heterogeneity in patients' responses and it adopts a profit-maximising listing strategy, the outcome may be independent of the choice of the type of value-based price. In this case, the information advantage that the manufacturer has prevents the payer from using marginal value-based prices to extract part of the surplus. However, in a dynamic setting where competition by a new entrant is possible, the choice of the type of value-based price may matter. We suggest that more research should be devoted to the dynamic analysis of price regulation for personalised medicines.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-019-00541-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31788763/,economics

"We investigated the effects of prospectively identified factors on the duration of hospital stay and part A charges in 240 hospitalizations (of 230 patients) for the diagnosis-related group ""medical back problems"" (DRG 243) at a tertiary-care institution in 1985 to determine whether heterogeneity existed within this reimbursement category. We confirmed our initial postulates that nonosteoporotic fractures and neck problems, as well as hospitalizations primarily for myelography after outpatient neurologic evaluation, had considerably different economic outcomes and thus excluded these categories from further analysis. Statistical analysis (forward stepwise regression) of the remaining 132 patients who had ""general medical back problems"" showed that increasing age, associated osteoporosis, and therapeutic injections best explained variation in the natural logarithm of duration of stay (R2 = 0.16). Total number of diagnoses, spondylosis, associated osteoporosis, age, therapeutic injections, and performance of special procedures best explained the variation in the logarithm of part A charges (R2 = 0.29). The ability to identify factors within a specified category that affect the duration of hospitalization and part A charges jeopardizes the fairness of prospective payment, and we believe that DRG 243 should be adjusted for age, comorbidity, and readily identifiable clinical syndromes that have disparate economic consequences. Because of poorly substantiated efficacy and a significant association with longer hospital stays and higher part A charges, clinicians should review the use of therapeutic injections for medical back problems. Analysis of case-mix such as ours should be helpful in promoting efficient practice and ensuring the fairness of any reimbursement system.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0025-6196(12)64888-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3131599/,economics

We used Medicare Part D data for the period 2006-15 to examine sudden large price increases in generic drugs in the context of their base prices, duration, and accompanying changes in patients' out-of-pocket spending. The fraction of drugs that at least doubled in price increased from 1.00 percent of generic products in 2007 to 4.39 percent in 2013. Almost all were initially low- or medium-price medications and not among the most widely used generics. Changes in out-of-pocket spending for these drugs were modest. However, the elevated prices persisted for two to five years. Data for 2011-15 showed similar trends.

"Background:
        
      
      A commonly held view of the decision rule in economic evaluations in health care is that the final incremental cost-effectiveness ratio needs to be judged against some threshold, which is equal for all quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains. This reflects the assumption that ""a QALY is a QALY"" no matter who receives it, or the equity notion that all QALY gains are equally valuable, regardless of the context in which they are realized. If such an assumption does not adequately reflect the distributional concerns in society, however, different thresholds could be used for different QALY gains, whose relative values can be seen as ""equity weights.""

"This article uses Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data to assess whether a single-payer health system delivers more care at less cost than do other universal coverage models. Single-payer plans are defined as those that rely on a limited number of revenue sources and systems in which financing is concentrated and private insurance for hospital and medical services is limited. Single-payer advocates argue that this organizational model is best able to reduce administrative costs, control provider payments, and limit the supply of services. This analysis shows that single-payer-like systems do not do a consistently better job of controlling physician incomes but do achieve some administrative cost savings compared to more fragmented systems. Overall, single-payer systems are modestly less costly than their peers and spend a slightly smaller share of the gross domestic product (GDP) on health. There are, however, substantial variations both over time and across countries in the performance of the single-payer-like nations, as well as among the nations in the other universal coverage model categories. Overall, the differences in system performance among the universal coverage OECD countries are very small, while the difference between the performance of any one of these countries and the United States is enormous and persistent.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2009-017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19633224/,economics

The results show that most waste treatment methods have a role to play in a robust and flexible integrated waste management system, and that the waste hierarchy is valid as a rule of thumb from an environmental perspective. A review of social aspects shows that there is a general willingness among people to source separate wastes.

"Implant costs comprise the largest proportion of operating room supply costs for orthopedic trauma care. Over the years, hospitals have devised several methods of controlling these costs with the help of physicians. With increasing economic pressure, these negotiations have a tremendous ability to decrease the cost of trauma care. In the past, physicians have taken no responsibility for implant pricing which has made cost control difficult. The reasons have been multifactorial. However, industry surgeon consulting fees, research support, and surgeon comfort with certain implant systems have played a large role in slowing adoption of cost-control measures. With the advent of physician gainsharing and comanagement agreements, physicians now have impetus to change.

"We estimated the economic costs of informal care in the community from 2015 to 2030, using an Australian microsimulation model, Care&WorkMOD. The model was based on data from three Surveys of Disability, Ageing, and Carers (SDACs) for the Australian population aged 15-64 years old. Estimated national income lost was AU$3.58 billion in 2015, increasing to $5.33 billion in 2030 (49% increase). Lost tax payments were estimated at AU$0.99 billion in 2015, increasing to AU$1.44 billion in 2030 (45% increase), and additional welfare payments were expected to rise from $1.45 billion in 2015 to AU$1.94 in 2030 (34% increase). There are substantial economic costs both to informal carers and the government due to carers being out of the labour-force to provide informal care for people with chronic diseases. Health and social policies supporting carers to remain in the labour force may allow governments to make substantial savings, while improving the economic situation of carers.",https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.12670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30378213/,economics
"This essay has sought to develop a rationale for new approach to the formal modeling of intergovernmental budgetary relations. The focus has been on health care budgeting, and on evidence from centrally-planned systems in Eastern Europe. But it has been argued that the modeling strategy advanced here will have applicability across policy areas, and across types of political and economic systems. The description of developments in human service provision emphasized the growing complexity of policy activity along both vertical and horizontal dimensions, and the accompanying increase in competition and in strategic thinking as central elements of policy activity generally, and of intergovernmental budgetary relations specifically. It has been argued that these developments are observable not only in Western pluralist systems--where the adumbration of evidence makes it increasingly difficult to take exception to these generalizations--but also in highly-structured systems such as the communist-governed systems of Eastern Europe. The possibility that certain elements of human service policy activity are becoming increasingly similar across ideologically and structurally different system types has numerous significant implications worth exploring. The next step will be the testing of the full set of linear systems theory models with data from Eastern Europe. If these tests are encouraging, important methodological implications for the modeling of budgetary activity would seem to follow.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-8-3-519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6417221/,economics

This paper provides an empirical test of the theory of strategic regulatory entry deterrence--the theory that subgroups of firms within an industry will use the regulatory process to increase rivals' costs and thereby deter rivals' entry. The results suggest that the commercial practice restrictions present in the ophthalmic industry deterred chain optical firms' entry into the market. This result in combination with earlier findings that the restrictions increase optometrists' prices suggests that cost-raising strategies can be used to disadvantage rivals or drive them out of the market without the need to lower price.,https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(89)90025-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10296711/,economics
"To economically evaluate a new drug or other medical innovation one must assess both the changes in costs and in benefits. Safety and efficacy matter, but so do resources costs and social benefits. This paper evaluates the effects on expenditures of the recent introduction of cimetidine, a drug used in the prevention and treatment of duodenal ulcers. This evaluation is of interest in its own right and also as a ""guide"" for studying similar effects of other innovations. State Medicaid records are used to test the effects on hospitalization and aggregate medical care expenditures of this new medical innovation. After controlling to the extent possible for potential selection bias, we find that: 1) usage of cimetidine is associated with a lower level of medical care expenditures and fewer days of hospitalization per patient for those duodenal ulcer patients who had zero health care expenditures and zero days of hospitalization during the presample period; an annual cost saving of some $320.00 (20 per cent) per patient is indicated. Further analysis disclosed, however, that this saving was lower for patients with somewhat higher levels of health care expenditures and hospitalization in the presample period, and to some extent was reversed for the patients whose prior year's medical care expenditures and hospitalization were highest.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-198208000-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6810034/,economics

"The likely impact of applying the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to higher education are examined. GATS aims to ""open up"" services to competition: no preference can be shown to national or government providers. The consequences for teaching are likely to be that private companies, with degree-awarding powers, would be eligible for the same subsidies as public providers. Appealing to the inadequate recently introduced ""benchmark"" statements as proof of quality, they would provide a ""bare bones"" service at lower cost. Public subsidies would go: education being reduced to that minimum which could be packaged in terms of verifiable ""learning outcomes"". The loss of ""higher"" aspirations, such education of critically-minded citizens of a democratic and civilized society would impoverish the university's research culture which demands honesty and openness to public scrutiny. Most university research is substantially supported by public subsidy. Under GATS discipline, commercial providers of research services could be entitled to similar public subsidies. Publicly funded fundamental research would fade, leaving university research totally dependent for funds upon the good will of industry and commerce. Present problems, such as the suppression of unwelcome results and the use of questionable results to manipulate public opinion, would considerably increase.

"Background:
        
      
      Blood disorders comprise a wide range of diseases including anaemia, malignant blood disorders, and haemorrhagic disorders. Although they are a common cause of disease, no systematic cost-of-illness studies have been done to assess the economic effect of non-malignant blood disorders in Europe. We aimed to assess the economic burden of non-malignant blood disorders across the 28 countries of the European Union (EU), Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Non-malignant blood disorder-related costs (WHO International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD] D50-89) were estimated for 28 EU countries, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland for 2012. Country-specific costs were estimated with aggregate data on morbidity, mortality, and health-care resource use obtained from international and national sources. Health-care costs were estimated from expenditure on primary care, outpatient care, emergency care, hospital inpatient care, and drugs. Costs of informal care and productivity losses due to morbidity and early death were also included. To these costs we added those due to malignant blood disorders (ICD-10 C81-96 and D47) as estimated in a Burns and colleagues' companion Article to obtain the total costs of blood disorders.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Non-malignant disorders of the blood cost the 31 European countries €11 billion in 2012. Health-care costs accounted for €8 billion (75% of total costs), productivity losses for €2 billion (19%), and informal care for less than €1 billion (6%). Averaged across the European population studied, non-malignant disorders of the blood represented an annual health-care cost of €159 per ten citizens. Combining malignant and non-malignant blood disorders, the total cost of blood disorders was €23 billion in 2012.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Our study highlights the economic burden that non-malignant blood disorders place on European health-care systems and societies. Our study also shows that blood disorder costs were evenly distributed between malignant and non-malignant blood disorders. Our results should be of use to decision makers and research-funding authorities charged with allocating health-care resources and research funds.

"Background:
        
      
      There have been several explorations of factors influencing the reimbursement decisions of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) but not of other UK-based health technology assessment (HTA) organizations.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to explore the factors influencing the recommendations of the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG) on the use of new medicines in Wales.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on public data, logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the influence of cost effectiveness, the quality and quantity of clinical evidence, disease characteristics (including rarity), budget impact, and a range of other factors on the recommendations of AWMSG and its subcommittee, the New Medicines Group (NMG).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Multivariate analyses of 47 AWMSG appraisals between 2007-9 correctly predicted 87% of decisions. The results are suggestive of a positive influence on recommendations of the presence of probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) but, counter-intuitively, a statistically significant negative influence of evidence from high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [odds ratio 0.059; 95% CI 0.005, 0.699]. This latter observation may be attributed to our strict definition of high quality, which excluded the use of surrogate endpoints. Putative explanatory variables, including cost effectiveness, budget impact, underlying disease characteristics and 'ultra'-orphan drug status were not statistically significant predictors of final AWMSG decisions based on our dataset. Univariate analyses indicate that medicines with negative recommendations had significantly higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than those with positive recommendations, consistent with the pursuit of economic efficiency. There is also evidence that AWMSG considers equity issues via an ultra-orphan drugs policy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Consideration of decision uncertainty via PSA appears to positively influence the reimbursement decisions of AWMSG. The significant negative impact of the presence of high-quality RCTs, and the lack of a significant positive impact of other expected factors, may reflect issues in the plausibility of supporting evidence for medicines that received negative recommendations. Furthermore, it serves to emphasize the difficulties in applying the usual hierarchies of evidence to the HTA process, and in particular to the appraisal of high-cost specialist medicines close to market launch.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11591530-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22676385/,economics

"The contemporary expansion of investor-owned health care facilities has stimulated much controversy but little response from policymakers. We believe this results from the apparently ambiguous relationship between ownership and socially valued outcomes. In our assessment, this ambiguity occurs largely because the effects of ownership are mediated in complex ways by characteristics of the services being delivered and the training of health care providers. Reviewing both the history and current performance of nonprofit and for-profit health care facilities, we identify some of the more important of these mediating factors. Taking these into account, there is a consistent influence of ownership on the delivery of health services. On the basis of this analysis, we discuss appropriate policy responses to the future growth of investor-owned health care organizations.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-12-3-427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3316367/,economics
"In pharmacoeconomic research sponsored by companies, there is an obvious tension between the desire to undertake studies to show a marketing advantage and the desire to adhere to good scientific principles. This tension was explored in an early issue of PharmacoEconomics and is now revisited 5 years on. Bias is still perceived to be a major problem in industry-sponsored studies, both by healthcare decision-makers and journal editors. However, the debate about bias has matured over the years. Also, actual evidence of bias in study methodology is sparse, although biases in study topic selection and in the use, in promotion, of study results have been found. A number of constructive suggestions have been made in the last 5 years for reducing potential bias. These include developing methodological guidelines and standards, improving the peer review process, clarifying contractual relationships between sponsors and analysts, and ensuring appropriate use of studies in promotional activities. However, further initiatives could be undertaken. These include additional guidelines for specific detailed areas of economic evaluation methodology, changes in the structure of funding for pharmacoeconomic research, more education of consumers for pharmacoeconomic data and more research partnerships between industry and its customers.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199814010-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10182189/,economics
"In the political debate, even in academia, the concepts of ""profitability"" or ""efficiency"" are thrown around very robustly and freely with no regard for the players themselves. Economically speaking there can be no efficiency without a definition of targets in terms of outcomes and their level of quality. If even the government's Council of Economic Experts itself finds in its assessment of hospital funding that the ""reform's target parameters - improving the profitability of service provision - have developed positively"", but adds that ""whether this also applies to the quality of services provided or to the realisation of healthcare outcomes remains to be seen due to the lack of evidence"" [21], this indicates a one-sided and problematic curtailment of the concept even by highly competent bodies. Economic control of new forms of healthcare by means of prices and fees for clearly defined services is a complex problem that has not been dealt with adequately. All pricing is based on classification models aimed at ensuring cost and benefit clusters that are as homogeneous as possible. Classification models in healthcare as a basis for price control targets need constant adjusting to ensure accuracy of mapping and appropriateness to performance. A prerequisite for the methodology behind price control models of this kind is presupposing a responsible, rule-bound and criteria-based handling of ""variance"" and ""coincidence"" by means of risk-adjusted quality and price systems. They will define the character of a wide range of steering tools and have an effect that goes beyond the narrow formal confines of the sector. That is why the regulatory framework will need first and foremost to define a qualitative framework for the political ""security infrastructure"" by means of deregulated economic processes in which price control becomes accountable and is justified in terms of content.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-008-0527-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18425693/,economics
"Hospitals are responsible for a remarkable part of the annual increase in healthcare expenditure. This article examines one of the major cost drivers, the expenditure for investment in hospital assets. The study, conducted in Switzerland, identifies factors that influence hospitals' investment decisions. A suggestion on how to categorize asset investment models is presented based on the life cycle of an asset, and its influencing factors defined based on transaction cost economics. The influence of five factors (human asset specificity, physical asset specificity, uncertainty, bargaining power, and privacy of ownership) on the selection of an asset investment model is examined using a two-step fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. The research shows that outsourcing-oriented asset investment models are particularly favored in the presence of two combinations of influencing factors: First, if technological uncertainty is high and both human asset specificity and bargaining power of a hospital are low. Second, if assets are very specific, technological uncertainty is high and there is a private hospital with low bargaining power, outsourcing-oriented asset investment models are favored too. Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis, it can be demonstrated that investment decisions of hospitals do not depend on isolated influencing factors but on a combination of factors.

"Background:
        
      
      China has the largest population of cataract patients in the world. However, the cataract surgery rate per million remains low in China. We carried out a survey on costs of cataract surgery from four different graded providers in China and analyzed differences in cost among these clinics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      1,189 patients were recruited for the study in four eye clinics, located in two provinces, Guangdong province in southern China and Hubei province in central China. The average cost of each cataract surgery episode was calculated including cost of intraocular lens, cost of drugs and facility cost. We also collected information on reimbursement and disposable annual income of local residents.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean total cost per cataract intervention of four different providers varied considerably, ranging from US$ 1,293 in Union Hospital to US$ 536 in Jingshan County Hospital. In all providers, except for Jingshan County Hospital, the cost exceeded annual disposable income of local rural residents. As to the proportion of patients with reimbursement, the figure for Union Hospital was only 36%, while for other three clinics it was more than 60%. There was a significant difference between mean reimbursement ratios, with the highest ratio in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center being 71%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Significant differences in costs of cataract surgery were found among the 4 different graded providers. A part of the cost was borne by patients. Proportion of patients with reimbursement and mean reimbursement ratios were higher in economically developed regions than in economically developing regions.

"Purpose of review:
        
      
      From health systems to individuals, nephrolithiasis is economically burdensome. The aim of the current paper is to characterize the financial burden of disease associated with nephrolithiasis with an emphasis on investigating treatment modality economic efficiency.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      For small volume practices and cases where there is high risk of scope damage, disposable flexible ureteroscope utilization seems to provide economic efficiency. The rise in global prevalence of stone disease is a large contributing factor to increasing costs associated with nephrolithiasis. A large proportion of costs from kidney stones stem from ED visits and inpatient care. There are opportunities to save money by transitioning care to outpatient settings in scenarios that allow such transition. Metaphylaxis and prevention strategies are effective at lowering costs in properly selected patient populations. Flexible ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) are the most economically efficient methods of surgically treating stone disease, with PCNL being reserved for large and lower pole stones. Time off work and other indirect costs, while challenging to quantify, are important considerations in the economics of nephrolithiasis.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-020-00971-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32236700/,economics
"Debilitating, long-term illness can impose a significant economic hardship on families affected with the illness and on the wider society as well. In addition to medical research to find a cure or a prevention for such illnesses, society may wish, in the interim, to allocate resources to compensate the families burdened by the illness for the economic losses they have suffered. Such compensation will take the form of a social insurance program.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides assistance to low-income consumers through both premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). Low-income consumers' lack of health insurance literacy or information regarding CSRs may lead them to not take-up CSR benefits for which they are eligible. We use administrative data from 2014 to 2016 on roughly 22 million health insurance plan choices of low-income individuals enrolled in ACA Marketplace coverage to assess whether they behave in a manner consistent with being aware of the availability of CSRs. We take advantage of discontinuous changes in the schedule of CSR benefits to show that consumers are highly sensitive to the value of CSRs when selecting insurance plans and that a very low percentage select dominated plans. These findings suggest that CSR subsidies are salient to consumers and that the program is well designed to account for any lack of health insurance literacy among the low-income population it serves.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2017.09.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28982036/,economics
"Private insurers pay widely varying prices for inpatient care across hospitals. Previous research indicates that certain hospitals use market clout to obtain higher payment rates, but there have been few in-depth examinations of the relationship between hospital characteristics and pricing power. This study used private insurance claims data to identify hospitals receiving inpatient prices significantly higher or lower than the median in their market. High-price hospitals, compared to other hospitals, tend to be larger; be major teaching hospitals; belong to systems with large market shares; and provide specialized services, such as heart transplants and Level I trauma care. High-price hospitals also receive significant revenues from nonpatient sources, such as state Medicaid disproportionate-share hospital funds, and they enjoy healthy total financial margins. Quality indicators for high-price hospitals were mixed: High-price hospitals fared much better than low-price hospitals did in U.S. News & World Report rankings, which are largely based on reputation, while generally scoring worse on objective measures of quality, such as postsurgical mortality rates. Thus, insurers may face resistance if they attempt to steer patients away from high-price hospitals because these facilities have good reputations and offer specialized services that may be unique in their markets.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24476706/,economics

"To promote global food and ecosystem security, several innovative farming systems have been identified that better balance multiple sustainability goals. The most rapidly growing and contentious of these systems is organic agriculture. Whether organic agriculture can continue to expand will likely be determined by whether it is economically competitive with conventional agriculture. Here, we examined the financial performance of organic and conventional agriculture by conducting a meta-analysis of a global dataset spanning 55 crops grown on five continents. When organic premiums were not applied, benefit/cost ratios (-8 to -7%) and net present values (-27 to -23%) of organic agriculture were significantly lower than conventional agriculture. However, when actual premiums were applied, organic agriculture was significantly more profitable (22-35%) and had higher benefit/cost ratios (20-24%) than conventional agriculture. Although premiums were 29-32%, breakeven premiums necessary for organic profits to match conventional profits were only 5-7%, even with organic yields being 10-18% lower. Total costs were not significantly different, but labor costs were significantly higher (7-13%) with organic farming practices. Studies in our meta-analysis accounted for neither environmental costs (negative externalities) nor ecosystem services from good farming practices, which likely favor organic agriculture. With only 1% of the global agricultural land in organic production, our findings suggest that organic agriculture can continue to expand even if premiums decline. Furthermore, with their multiple sustainability benefits, organic farming systems can contribute a larger share in feeding the world.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1423674112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26034271/,economics
"Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) are currently being introduced on a national scale as a prospective reimbursement scheme in Swiss in-patient hospital care, replacing any remaining retrospective day-rate arrangements. DRGs are expected to promote transparency and efficiency while helping to contain health care costs. The governmental decision to introduce DRGs has caused considerable controversy among different stakeholders, due to diverging appraisals of what will happen when DRGs are introduced as an economic management tool in Switzerland. The controversial discourse on DRGs is particularly interesting from an ethical point of view, since all arguments inevitably contain ethical considerations. In this paper we summarise the results of our exploratory ethical studies that have led to a larger research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation: ""Impact of Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) on patient care and professional practice"" (IDoC). In section 1: 'Developing an understanding of the ethical issues at stake' we briefly explain how DRGs work, what the intended effects are, what the public is concerned about and what the scientific research tells us so far. In section 2: 'Developing an ethical framework for research on DRGs in Switzerland' we summarise the ethical issues and explain the ethical framework we will use in order to perform research on the complex issue of DRGs in Switzerland. Only once a profound understanding of the challenges exists can research on the ethical implications of DRGs be successful.",https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2012.13610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22879074/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The economic evaluation of healthcare technologies has become in many countries a basic tool for reimbursement, pricing and purchasing decisions.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this article is to examine the institutional, legal, and political factors that have impeded the application of economic evaluation and the criterion of efficiency in the process of pricing and reimbursement of new medicines in Spain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Narrative description of the current institutional framework for the use of economic evaluation in pricing and reimbursement in Spain, legal and policy framework in the field of evaluation of new medicines, and stakeholder initiatives and policies related to the use of economic evaluation outside of the pricing and reimbursement process.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Spain has an institutional framework created and established over the last years that could have facilitated a formal use of economic evaluation in the process of pricing and reimbursement. Nevertheless, the real use of economic evaluation at the central or regional level is still unknown, although application of the efficiency criterion, linking to cost-effectiveness, has been clearly required by Spanish laws and regulations at the national level. We highlight a certain degree of moral hazard from the central government that is not directly responsible for the budget impact of reimbursement and pricing decisions. There are currently a number of ongoing initiatives in the field of economic evaluation by various agents, but they remain uncoordinated.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Poor governance at the highest level of decision making is the main reason for the lack of interest in economic evaluation. A profound political change, supported by transparency and accountability, is required before the criterion of efficiency can be fully considered in the process of pricing and reimbursement of new medicines in Spain.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.06.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31952669/,economics
"The chapter studies hospital competition in a spatially differentiated market in which patient demand reflects the quality/distance mix that maximizes their utility. Treatment is free at the point of use and patients freely choose the provider which best fits their expectations. Hospitals might have asymmetric objectives and costs, however they are reimbursed using a uniform prospective payment. The chapter provides different equilibrium outcomes, under perfect and asymmetric information. The results show that asymmetric costs, in the case where hospitals are profit maximizers, allow for a social welfare and quality improvement. On the other hand, the presence of a publicly managed hospital which pursues the objective of quality maximization is able to ensure a higher level of quality, patient surplus and welfare. However, the extent of this outcome might be considerably reduced when high levels of public hospital inefficiency are detectable. Finally, the negative consequences caused by the presence of asymmetric information are highlighted in the different scenarios of ownership/objectives and costs. The setting adopted in the model aims at describing the up-coming European market for secondary health care, focusing on hospital behavior and it is intended to help the policy-maker in understanding real world dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-88-470-5480-6_9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24864388/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Although little mortality is associated with irritable bowel syndrome, curative therapy does not exist and thus the economic impact of this disorder may be considerable.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of the literature was performed. Studies were included if their focus was irritable bowel syndrome, and direct and/or productivity (indirect) costs were reported. Two investigators abstracted the data independently.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and seventy-four studies were retrieved by the search; 11 fulfilled all criteria for entry into the review. The mean direct costs of irritable bowel syndrome management were reported to be UK pound sterling90, Canadian$259 and US$619 per patient annually, with total annual direct costs related to irritable bowel syndrome of pound sterling45.6 million (UK) and $1.35 billion (USA). Direct resource consumption of all health care for irritable bowel syndrome patients ranged from US$742 to US$3166. Productivity costs ranged from US$335 to US$748, with total annual costs of $205 million estimated in the USA. Annual expenditure for all health care, in addition to expenditure limited to gastrointestinal disorders, was significantly higher in irritable bowel syndrome patients than in control populations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite the lack of significant mortality, irritable bowel syndrome is associated with high direct and productivity costs. Irritable bowel syndrome patients consume more gastrointestinal-related and more total health care resources than non-irritable bowel syndrome controls, and sustain significantly greater productivity losses.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2003.t01-1-01736.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14510740/,economics
"A fundamental aspect of the German health insurance system is the principle of solidarity. At the same time, it is possible for certain socio-economic groups to opt out of the otherwise compulsory system. To determine whether rates incorporating deductibles are compatible with the principles of solidarity and have the ability to heighten the appeal of statutory health insurance (SHI) funds compared with private health insurance companies, Germany's third largest SHI fund, Techniker Krankenkasse, implemented a pilot scheme involving the use of deductibles. Preliminary scientific evaluations of the pilot scheme indicate three main results for these deductibles: Firstly, they are compatible with the principles of solidarity in the statutory health insurance system; secondly, they provide an effective means of preventing defection to private health insurance companies and thirdly, they reduced the volume of insurance claims (moral hazard).",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-006-0359-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16802119/,economics

"The extent of price variation across a local market has important implications for value-based purchasing. Using a new data set containing health care prices for nearly every insurer-provider-service triad across a large local market, we comprehensively examined variation in fee-for-service paid commercial prices in Massachusetts for 291 predominantly outpatient medical services. Prices varied considerably across hospital service areas. Prices for medical services at acute hospitals were, on average, 76 percent higher than at all other providers. The service categories with the widest price variation were ambulance/transportation services, physical/occupational therapy, and laboratory/pathology testing. In this market, simulations suggested that steering patients toward lower-price providers or setting price ceilings could generate potential savings of 9.0-12.8 percent. Marketwide price information at the insurer-provider-service level could help target policy interventions to reduce health care spending.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05315,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31479358/,economics
"ABSTRACTLong-term care is a growing component of health care spending but how much is spent or who bears the cost is uncertain, and the measures vary depending on the source used. We drew on regularly published series and ad hoc publications to compile preferred estimates of the share of long-term care spending in total health care spending, the private share of long-term care spending, and the share of residential care within long-term care. For each series, we compared estimates obtainable from published sources (CIHI [Canadian Institute for Health Information] and OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]) with our preferred estimates. We conclude that using published series without adjustment would lead to spurious conclusions on the level and evolution of spending on long-term care in Canada as well as on the distribution of costs between private and public funders and between residential and home care.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0714980818000028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29676243/,economics
"Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) are frequently criticized for their marketing mistakes. Often that criticism is leveled against an implicit benchmark of an ideal competitive market or an ideal system of government provision. But any accurate assessment in the choice of health care organizations always requires a comparative measure of error rates. These are high in the provision of health care, given the inherent uncertainties in both the cost and effectiveness of treatment. But the continuous and rapid evolution of private health care mechanisms is, in the absence of regulation, more likely to secure access and contain costs than any system of government regulation. State regulation is subject to the risk of capture and to the sluggish and acquisitive behavior of state run monopolies. The proposed fixes for the MCOs (rights to specialists, access to physicians outside the network, guaranteed emergency room access) are likely, when imposed from without, to cost more than they are worth. The long-term risk is that markets will fail under regulation, paving the way for greater losses from massive government control of the health care delivery system.",https://doi.org/10.1076/jmep.24.5.434.2516,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10614731/,economics
"Water reuse is an emerging and promising non-conventional water resource. Feasibility studies are essential tools in the decision making process for the implementation of water-reuse projects. However, the methods used to assess economic feasibility tend to focus on internal costs, while external impacts are relegated to unsubstantiated statements about the advantages of water reuse. Using the concept of shadow prices for undesirable outputs of water reclamation, the current study developed a theoretical methodology to assess internal and external economic impacts. The proposed methodological approach is applied to 13 wastewater treatment plants in the Valencia region of Spain that reuse effluent for environmental purposes. Internal benefit analyses indicated that only a proportion of projects were economically viable, while when external benefits are incorporated all projects were economically viable.

"Since the end of its internal conflict in 1998, Cambodia has experienced tremendous developments in the social, economic and health sectors, with the government embarking on substantial reforms in health financing. Health equity funds that have improved access to public health services for poor people have gradually been extended to the entire country. Using the World Health Organization's methods for the analysis of healthcare expenditure and household survey data from the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Cambodian Socio-Economic Survey, we assessed trends in reported illness, utilization of healthcare services and associated financial burden on households. The impact of out-of-pocket expenditures for health on catastrophic health expenditures, poverty headcount and depth over the same 10-year period are presented, disaggregated by consumption quintile and place of residence (rural, urban and capital). At the aggregated national level, evolution of these indicators was very positive and correlates with a substantial increase in the capacity-to-pay of households, which reduced the average financial burden on households. However, over time inequalities grew between rural and urban areas. By 2014, the national incidence of catastrophic health expenditure was 4.9%, but four times more likely among rural households than their peers in the capital. For rural households with members seeking medical care, catastrophic health expenditure incidence was 12.3%. The impoverishment rate due to health spending among the lowest consumption quintile was 15.3%; the highest rate in this analysis. These findings suggest that economic and health sector developments have indeed benefited many Cambodian people. However, these gains mainly benefited urban residents; especially those in the capital city. We argue that more resources should be allocated to rural health services to address inequalities and healthcare-related financial hardship, which traps vulnerable people into poverty.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czy073,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30165473/,economics

"Little is known about health system equity in Tanzania, whether in terms of distribution of the health care financing burden or distribution of health care benefits. This study undertook a combined analysis of both financing and benefit incidence to explore the distribution of health care benefits and financing burden across socio-economic groups. A system-wide analysis of benefits was undertaken, including benefits from all providers irrespective of ownership. The analysis used the household budget survey (HBS) from 2001, the most recent nationally representative survey data publicly available at the time, to analyse the distribution of health care payments through user fees, health insurance contributions [from the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) for the formal sector and the Community Health Fund (CHF), for the rural informal sector] and taxation. Due to lack of information on NHIF and CHF contributions in the HBS, a primary survey was administered to estimate CHF enrollment and contributions; assumptions were used to estimate NHIF contributions within the HBS. Data from the same household survey, administered to 2224 households in seven districts/councils, was used to analyse the distribution of health care benefits across socio-economic groups. The health financing system was mildly progressive overall, with income taxes and NHIF contributions being the most progressive financing sources. Out-of-pocket payments and contributions to the CHF were regressive. The health benefit distribution was fairly even but the poorest received a lower share of benefits relative to their share of need for health care. Public primary care facility use was pro-poor, whereas higher level and higher cost facility use was generally pro-rich. We conclude that health financing reforms can improve equity, so long as integration of health insurance schemes is promoted along with cross-subsidization and greater reliance on general taxation to finance health care for the poorest.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czs018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22388497/,economics
"Drawing on observations from tracking changes in local health care markets over the past ten years, this article critiques two Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice recommendations to enhance price and quality competition. First, we take issue with the notion that consumers, acting independently, will drive greater competition in health care markets. Rather we suggest an important role remains for trusted agents who can analyze inherently complex price and quality information and negotiate on consumers' behalf. With aggregated information identifying providers who deliver cost-effective care, consumers would be better positioned to respond to financial incentives about where to seek care and thereby drive more meaningful competition among providers to reduce costs and improve quality. Second, we take issue with the FTC/DOJ recommendation to provide more direct subsidies to prevent distortions in competition. In the current political environment, it is not practical to provide direct subsidies for all of the unfunded care that exists in health care markets today; instead, some interference with competition may be necessary to protect cross subsidies. Barriers can be reduced, though, by revising pricing policies that have resulted in marked disparities in the relative profitability of different services.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2005-006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16785297/,economics
"We evaluate the introduction of a reimbursement schedule for self-employed mental health care providers in the Netherlands in 2008. The reimbursement schedule follows a discontinuous discrete step function-once the provider has passed a treatment duration threshold the fee is flat until a next threshold is reached. We use administrative mental health care data of the total Dutch population from 2008 to 2010. We find an ""efficiency"" effect: on the flat part of the fee schedule providers reduce treatment duration by 2 to 7% compared to a control group. However, we also find unintended effects: providers treat patients longer to reach a next threshold and obtain a higher fee. The data shows gaps and bunches in the distribution function of treatment durations, just before and after a threshold. About 11 to 13% of treatments are shifted over a next threshold, resulting in a cost increase of approximately 7 to 9%.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2015.03.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974274/,economics
"Objectives:

      We used the All-Payer Claims Database from Maine (2012-2014) to compare health insurance claims for lactation classes and breast pumps between women with private insurance and women with Medicaid (1) before the ACA breastfeeding provision, (2) after the provision came into effect, and (3) after health insurance expansion through the Marketplace.

"We examine the influence of strategic choice on working capital configurations and observe how the relationship between working capital ratio and operational performance differs depending on strategy. By clustering the strategic factors of the wholesale and retail industry, we find three categories of strategies: terminal market strategy, middle market strategy, and hybrid strategy. Using the panel data of the listed companies of the wholesale and retail industry as our sample, we analyze the differences in the ways companies configure working capital, the speed with which working capital adjusts to its target, and the effects of working capital on performance for companies that make different strategic choices. The empirical results suggest that working capital is configured and adjusted to its target in different ways under different competitive strategic choices.

"Throughout economic history, the global economy has experienced recurring crises. The persistent recurrence of such economic crises calls for an understanding of their generic features rather than treating them as singular events. The global economic system is a highly complex system and can best be viewed in terms of a network of interacting macroeconomic agents. In this regard, from the perspective of collective network dynamics, here we explore how the topology of the global macroeconomic network affects the patterns of spreading of economic crises. Using a simple toy model of crisis spreading, we demonstrate that an individual country's role in crisis spreading is not only dependent on its gross macroeconomic capacities, but also on its local and global connectivity profile in the context of the world economic network. We find that on one hand clustering of weak links at the regional scale can significantly aggravate the spread of crises, but on the other hand the current network structure at the global scale harbors higher tolerance of extreme crises compared to more ""globalized"" random networks. These results suggest that there can be a potential hidden cost in the ongoing globalization movement towards establishing less-constrained, trans-regional economic links between countries, by increasing vulnerability of the global economic system to extreme crises.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018443,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21483794/,economics

Concerns remain, however, that competition may undermine socio-economic equity in the utilisation of care.

We use a panel of 32,482 English small areas followed from 2003 to 2008 and a difference in differences approach. The effect of competition on equity is identified by the interaction between market structure, small area income deprivation and year. We find a negative association between market competition and elective admissions in deprived areas.

"Glaucoma has not received a great deal of attention from health economists in the past, partly due to the fact that no new treatments have been introduced for some time. Economic evaluation is generally performed for new technologies, to assess their cost-effectiveness compared with current treatments, to estimate the potential changes in the use of health care resources that their introduction may produce, and to make decisions about their reimbursement status and formulary inclusion. Economic studies in glaucoma have been largely limited to studies about cost, because a useful outcome measure has been lacking. Therapy aims at reducing intraocular pressure, but the data to estimate the absolute risk of vision loss due to high pressure have been lacking. Hence, it has been impossible to assess the benefit of treatments in terms of their ability to reduce blindness. However, as new out knowledge about these issues increases and more data become available, such studies become possible.

"During a time when cancer drug prices are increasing at an unprecedented rate, a debate has emerged as to whether these drugs continue to provide good value. In this article I argue that this debate is irrelevant because under today's highly distorted market, prices will not be set with value considerations in mind. As an alternative, I suggest considering the ""value"" of three policy changes—Medicare's ""average sales price plus 6 percent"" payment program, laws that require insurance coverage of all new cancer drugs, and the Affordable Care Act—that are fueling manufacturers' willingness to set higher prices. More important than these issues, however, is the revolution that is occurring in molecular biology and its impact on scientists' ability to detect changes in the cancer genome. The lowered cost of discovery is driving more competitors into the market, which under distorted pricing paradoxically encourages drug makers to charge ever higher prices for their products.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25847638/,economics
"In January 2021, the incoming Biden administration inherited urgent priorities for curbing health care spending and expanding health care coverage to millions of Americans while also addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn. Among these competing priorities is the issue of access to and affordability of prescription drugs. Here, the authors outline Biden's plan for directly lowering prescription drug spending for payers and patients and for expanding access to prescription medications through improved health insurance coverage. These policies could provide important financial protections for Americans against high prescription drug prices. Despite widespread public support for addressing prescription drug prices, many of Biden's plans rely on congressional action, which will be complicated by the narrow majority held by Democrats in the House and an evenly divided Senate. However, there may be other opportunities for reducing prescription drug spending and improving health insurance enrollment among the uninsured. While directly lowering drug prices would provide the most widespread savings for payers and patients alike, any successful effort for increasing the number of Americans enrolled in health insurance or rendering it more affordable will still likely effectively lower patients' out-of-pocket costs and improve access to prescription drugs.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-8970810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503239/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      Germany spends the highest share (10.4%) of its gross domestic product on health care among European Union countries. The majority of this financing comes from an earmarked tax on labor earnings. Drug spending, as a share (12.7%), is relatively low, as is per-capita drug spending. Over the past decade, a number of specific budgeting initiatives were introduced to control drug spending-with some success, at least until the 11% increase in the first 6 months of 2001.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This article describes and analyzes these governmental initiatives as well as other market reforms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Germany has had a ""drug budget silo mentality"" throughout this period. But the focus of the mentality moved rapidly from the central budget to regional budgets and to drug budgets per physician based on historical data. These amounts do not correspond to either medical necessity or economic considerations. An analysis of the health-care system as a whole shows that the efforts to constrain spending with budget in one area can lead to higher total costs. This article also considers the impact of introducing other actual or proposed reforms such as a positive list to replace the negative list, generic substitution, retail price competition among pharmacies, and E-health commerce. There is also a new national institute constructing a database of information on health technology assessments.

Average annual growth in private behavioral health spending during the recession slowed to 2.7 percent from 7.2 percent in 2004-07. State and local behavioral health spending showed negative average annual growth, -1.2 percent, during the recession, compared with 3.7 percent increases in 2004-07. In contrast, federal behavioral health spending growth accelerated to 11.1 percent during the recession, up from 7.2 percent in 2004-07. These behavioral health spending trends were driven largely by increased federal spending in Medicaid, declining private insurance enrollment, and severe state budget constraints. An increased federal Medicaid match reduced the state share of Medicaid spending, which prevented more drastic cuts in state-funded behavioral health programs during the recession. Federal Medicaid served as a critical safety net for people with behavioral health treatment needs during the recession.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1065,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650330/,economics
"The health insurance sector has been transformed in the past fifteen years, with managed care replacing indemnity insurance as the norm. This transformation was intended to change the nature of competition in the health care system so that market forces could be used to control costs. Empirical studies have shown that this objective has been met, as areas with high managed care penetration have tended to have much lower rates of increase in their costs. Creating a more efficient health care system will require additional efforts to produce useful measures of quality and to maintain competitive markets.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.15.2.185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8690375/,economics
"In the current healthcare environment, cost control is an ongoing concern of public and private payers and of healthcare administrators. For nursing leaders in this environment, a critical task is establishing nursing as a service line and communicating its value to the organization. The work of nurses needs to be better articulated and models such as the Fundamentals of Care Framework can assist in this. Also critical is presenting what is lost for patients and the hospital through missed care and its consequences when nurse staffing is inadequate. Economic analysis has found that when the cost savings from lower length of stay, reduced adverse outcomes, reduced admissions and other benefits of adequate staffing are taken into account, adequate staffing is affordable.",https://doi.org/10.12927/cjnl.2016.24643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27309639/,economics
"The clinical laboratory is an essential component of the medical-care system. Rapidly increasing expenditures for laboratory services, fraudulent practices and reports of laboratory error are precipitating legislative and regulatory actions that will affect clinical laboratories and how they are used by physicians in caring for their patients. Many problems related to clinical laboratories are due to the rapid introduction of new technologies, to methods of educating medical students and house officers, to the rapidly expanding scientific base of medicine and to economic factors that have subordinated medical and scientific objectives in the laboratory to economic ones. Implementation of existing legislation would settle many of the economic issues, but more effective integration of the clinical laboratory into the patient-care process and better methods for educating medical students in the use of laboratory information are critical tasks for the medical profession.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm197802232980804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/414135/,economics

"Adverse drug events occur frequently and lead to a significant number of fatalities each year. It has been estimated that fatalities directly attributable to adverse drug reactions are the fourth to sixth leading cause of death in US hospitals, exceeding deaths caused by pneumonia and diabetes. The economic burden resulting from drug-related morbidity and mortality is equally significant and has been conservatively estimated at $US30 billion dollars annually, and could exceed $US130 billion in a worst-case scenario. Since many adverse drug events are considered preventable, increased efforts should be made to avoid classes of drugs that are problem-prone and to initiate diligent monitoring of drugs with predictable toxicities. Programmes should also be implemented that improve medication use practices within institutions. Although nearly all drugs are capable of producing an injury, certain drugs are more likely to do so. Prevention of drug-related morbidity and mortality has become an increasingly important requirement for reducing healthcare expenditures.

Despite these disagreements, there are forces at work that might foster compromise. A compromise model that drew on past reform experiences would both expand coverage and focus spending on high-value care, ensuring that everyone had access to affordable basic care before subsidizing care of more questionable benefit and using choice and competition to promote cost-effective innovation.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.27.3.658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18474953/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      More than half of all medical procedures performed in the United States occur in an outpatient setting, yet few studies have explored how competition among ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and hospitals affects prices for commercially insured outpatient services.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      We examined the association between prices for commercially insured outpatient procedures and competition among ASCs and hospitals.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      Using claims from the Health Care Cost Institute for 2008-2012, we constructed county-level price indices for outpatient procedures in hospital outpatient departments and ASCs. Using regression analysis, we estimated the association between prices and ASC availability, outpatient and inpatient hospital competition, hospital/physician integration, and several other hospital market characteristics. Our estimates were identified from changes within counties over time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      First, ASC availability was associated with decreases in overall outpatient procedure prices, mostly due to reductions in the prices paid to hospital outpatient departments. Second, competition among hospitals was also associated with decreases in outpatient procedure prices-and had an effect more than twice as large as the effect of ASC availability. Third, competition among ASCs was also associated with reductions in the prices paid to other ASCs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results suggest that competition from ASCs benefits consumers through lower prices for outpatient procedures. Any conclusions about the broader welfare implications of the rise in ASCs, however, must balance the price reductions that we found with the volume increases found in previous work, particularly the volume increases at physician-owned ASCs.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30507654/,economics
"This research examines the causality (For the remainder of the paper, the notion of causality refers to Granger causality.) links among renewable energy consumption (REC), CO2 emissions (CE), non-renewable energy consumption (NREC), and economic growth (GDP) using an autoregressive distributed lag model based on the pooled mean group estimation (ARDL-PMG) and applying Granger causality tests for a panel consisting of 22 African countries for the period between 1990 and 2011. There is unidirectional and irreversible short-run causality from CE to GDP. The causal direction between CE and REC is unobservable over the short-term. Moreover, we find unidirectional, short-run causality from REC to GDP. When testing per pair of variables, there are short-run bidirectional causalities among REC, CE, and GDP. However, if we add CE to the variables REC and NREC, the causality to GDP is observable, and causality from the pair REC and NREC to economic growth is neutral. Likewise, if we add NREC to the variables GDP and REC, there is causality. There are bidirectional long-run causalities among REC, CE, and GDP, which supports the feedback assumption. Causality from GDP to REC is not strong for the panel. If we test per pair of variables, the strong causality from GDP and CE to REC is neutral.

"Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are experiencing both an economic crisis and a crisis in the public sector. As a result it is impossible to increase the amount of resources available to the health sector, unless there is a drastic restructuring of the way in which financing occurs. The measures so far referred to in the economic debate - user fees, cost recovery, privatization - at best represent partial solutions. Given the magnitude of health problem in LAC countries, they are unable to generate the amount of money needed to cover the deficit of financial resources for medical treatment. The central idea behind this article is that in order to cover the deficit of resources for medical it is necessary to utilize fiscal resources. It is shown that it is possible to increase the amount of financial resources available for medical treatment either through increases in taxes and/or through an increase in the proportion of the government budget dedicated to medical treatment. Increases in taxes collected provide a feasible alternative. In some of the poor countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, the proportion of the Gross National Product that goes for the payment of taxes is well below the figure for that proportion found in developed countries. To increase the proportion of the government budget dedicated to medical treatment is a political decision that depends solely upon the discretion of the governments concerned. The potential of Social Emergency Funds and debt swaps to finance innovations in the production of medical treatment services, thus maintaining the current level to activity in the sector, is discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1590/s0034-89101995000300012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8539536/,economics
"Short-run economic consequences of 'malaria' on households were examined in a household survey in Matale, a malaria-endemic district of Sri Lanka. On average a household incurred a total cost of Rs 318 (US$ 7) per patient who fully recovered from 'malaria'. 24% of this was direct cost, 44% indirect cost for the patient and 32% indirect cost for the household. Direct costs were greater for those seeking treatment in the private sector. Notably a large proportion of direct costs was spent on complementary goods such as vitamins and foods considered to be nutritional. Indirect cost was measured and valued on the basis of output/ income losses incurred at the household level rather than using a general indicator such as average wage rate. Loss of output and wages accounted for the highest proportion of the indirect cost of the patients as well as the households. Relative to children, more young adults and middle-aged people had 'malaria' which also caused greater economic loss in these age groups. Women tended to care for patients rather than substitute their labour to cover productive work lost due to illness. We compare the methods used by other researchers for valuing indirect cost, demonstrating the significant impact that methods of measurement and valuation can have on the estimation of indirect cost, and justify the recommendation for methodological research in this area.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3156.2000.00612.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11044273/,economics

Although this approach does not allow to estimate the economic cost of consultations, it is a useful contribution to assess the financial activity of the hospital and improve its performance, financially speaking, through a more relevant user fees policy. The study shows that there are possibilities of cross-subsidies within the hospital or within services which improve the recovery of some of the current costs.

"Objectives:
        
      
      Pharmaceutical reimbursement agencies' processes and methods of appraisal vary across countries. The objective of this study was to examine the contribution of formal health economic analysis in a process using such analysis in Scotland in comparison to a process not routinely using such analysis in France.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A framework for classifying reimbursement systems was used to analyze the two systems. A typology of recommendation was defined and a qualitative analysis of decisions on a sample of medicines appraised by both reimbursement agencies was conducted. Reasons for differences in recommendations were analyzed and case studies selected to illustrate the common reasons.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-nine common medicines appraised by both agencies were identified between 2005 and 2010, treating a variety of diseases for which the Scottish Medicines Consortium tended to provide more restrictive, or did not recommend, listing. Similarities in clinical evidence submitted to the respective reimbursement committees were observed. Differences in recommendation can be explained by a combination of the manufacturer's freedom to set price and the incentives provided by the consideration of health economic analysis and quality of life, alongside differences in relevant comparators, relevant outcomes, treatment guidelines, and the propensity to use network meta-analysis, in decision making.

"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common benign neoplasms in elderly men in the United States; it has been estimated that the annual costs of caring for these men exceed $4 billion. This condition is rarely life threatening, but often affects the individual's quality of life in varying degrees. There are several treatments for this condition, including surgery, with the most common procedure being transurethral resection of the prostate. Other treatment options include medication (such as finasteride and terazosin), balloon dilation, and watchful waiting. The cost associated with BPH depends on the severity of the disease and the appropriate course of treatment. The objective of this paper is to identify and evaluate the economic research papers that have considered either the economic burden or costs associated with alternative BPH therapy options and to identify key areas for future economic research. This review indicates that the economic studies of BPH are diverse in nature and greater attention needs to be placed on the societal appraisal of competing BPH therapies. Other research areas include the economic analysis of both short- and long-run BPH treatment options, increased cost-utility analysis, and the use of retrospective claims database analysis using regression techniques.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0149-2918(96)80078-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9001839/,economics

Allergic rhinitis imposes a substantial economic burden on society, with indirect costs of productivity loss being larger than the direct healthcare costs. Cost estimates were biased because of difficulties of diagnosis; exclusion of patients who do not seek healthcare; exclusion of over-the-counter medication; difficulties in estimating productivity loss. There is limited evidence on costs of seasonal/perennial and intermittent/persistent AR.

"The role of economic evaluation in the efficient allocation of healthcare resources has been widely debated. Whilst economic evidence is undoubtedly useful to purchasers, it does not address the issue of affordability which is an increasing concern. Healthcare purchasers are concerned not just with maximising efficiency but also with the more simplistic goal of remaining within their annual budgets. These two objectives are not necessarily consistent. This paper examines the issue of affordability, the relationship between affordability and efficiency and builds the case for why there is a growing need for budget impact models to complement economic evaluation. Guidance currently available for such models is also examined and it is concluded that this guidance is currently insufficient. Some of these insufficiencies are addressed and some thoughts on what constitutes best practice in budget impact modelling are suggested. These suggestions include consideration of transparency, clarity of perspective, reliability of data sources, the relationship between intermediate and final end-points and rates of adoption of new therapies. They also include the impact of intervention by population subgroups or indications, reporting of results, probability of re-deploying resources, the time horizon, exploring uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, and decision-maker access to the model. Due to the nature of budget impact models, the paper does not deliver stringent methodological guidance on modelling.

"The juxtaposition of economic and clinical evaluation raises new issues in the design of clinical trials. Recent pharmacoeconomic guidelines provide some direction, but do not deal with the appropriate timing of economic evaluations in the drug developmental process. Ideally, pharmacoeconomic data should be available at the time of the regulatory and formulary decision making. Current pivotal phase III trials do not provide these data; they are designed to test safety and efficacy (does the drug work under optimal circumstances?) and not to answer questions about the effectiveness of a drug, the more relevant question for economic analysis (does the drug work in usual care?). The use of more ""naturalistic"" designs for some phase III randomised trials has been suggested. These so called ""effectiveness trials"" more closely reflect routine clinical practice. They use a more flexible dosage regimen, and a ""usual care"" instead of a placebo comparator. Patients randomised are more representative of actual practice and outcomes include quality of life and utility measures. They are more suited to provide the data needed to estimate the real benefit of the treatment in actual care. When costs are applied and compared with these benefits, you can estimate the efficiency of allocating resources to this new drug.

"Background:
        
      
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer affecting men in the United States. The initial treatment and subsequent monitoring of PCa patients places a large burden on U.S. health care systems. The objectives of this study were to estimate the total and disease-related per-patient lifetime costs using a phase-based model of cancer care for PCa patients enrolled in Medicare.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A model was developed to estimate life-time costs for patients diagnosed with PCa. Patients ≥ 65 years old and diagnosed with PCa between calendar years 1991-2002 were selected from the SEER database. Using SEER, we estimated survival times for PCa patients from diagnosis until death. The period of time patients contributed to treatment phases was determined using an algorithm designed to model the natural history of PCa. Costs were obtained from the US SEER-Medicare database and estimated during specific phases of care. Cost estimates were then combined with survival data to yield total and PCa-related life-time costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, the model estimated life-time costs of $110,520 (95% CI 110,324-110,739) per patient. PCa-related costs made up approximately 31% of total costs ($34,432).

"The following study is an exploratory investigation into the opportunity identification, opportunity analysis, and strategic implications of implementing a cash-only family physician practice. The current market dynamics (i.e., increasing insurance premiums, decreasing benefits, more regulations and paperwork, and cuts in federal and state programs) suggest that there is sufficient motivation for these practitioners to change their current business model. In-depth interviews were conducted with office managers and physicians of family physician practices. The results highlighted a variety of issues, including barriers to change, strategy issues, and opportunities/benefits.

"This research reviews and analyses the environmental catastrophes in China with regard to its adherence of global environmental policies and practices. The research makes available evidence of the present policy regime and institutions, strategies for curbing emission, environmental legislations and regulations and measures to provide a sustainable environment for the present and future generations. This paper reviewed how the environment is affected by the emissions. The findings revealed that China adheres to global policies and practices. China also receives local and international support in terms of assistance in dealing with environmental challenges. It was also revealed that carbon dioxide was not included in the list of pollutants to be taxed by the environmental protection tax law. Furthermore, the government needs to be strict at the local and district levels in enforcing the law to ensure professionalism and attainment of set standards.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04167-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30656580/,economics
"A coalition of provincial, national and international addictions agencies has sponsored a series of symposia leading to the developing of international guidelines for estimating the costs of substance abuse. These guidelines have now been used in national studies in four continents, with more consistent and comparable results than in previous studies. Although the bottom-line results have been used to argue for alcohol and drug issues having a higher place on the public policy agenda, the real value in such studies lies in the detailed results regarding mortality and morbidity attributable to substance abuse, the relative contribution of acute versus chronic conditions to overall problem levels and the role of substance misuse in adverse social consequences, such as crime and economic productivity. There is a variety of factors which undermine the robustness of the findings, including lack of data, layering of assumptions and changes in the epidemiological knowledge base. It is argued that economic cost estimates should nonetheless be conducted and continually refined, as the detailed findings are of great utility to the design and targeting of prevention programming and policy.

"Background:
        
      
      In Finland like in many other countries, employers are legally obliged to organize occupational health services (OHS) for their employees. Because employers bear the costs of OHS it could be that in spite of the legal requirement OHS expenditure is more determined by economic performance of the company than by law. Therefore, we explored whether economic performance was associated with the companies' expenditure on occupational health services.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a prospective design to predict expenditure on OHS in 2001 by a company's economic performance in 1999. Data were provided by Statistics Finland and expressed by key indicators for profitability, solidity and liquidity and by the Social Insurance Institution as employers' reimbursement applications for OHS costs. The data could be linked at the company level. Regression analysis was used to study associations adjusted for various confounders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nineteen percent of the companies (N = 6 155) did not apply for reimbursement of OHS costs in 2001. The profitability of the company represented by operating margin in 1999 and adjusted for type of industry was not significantly related to the company's probability to apply for reimbursement of the costs in 2001 (OR = 1.00, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.01). Profitability measured as operating profit in 1999 and adjusted for type of industry was not significantly related to costs for curative medical services (Beta -0.001, 95%CI: -0.00 to 0.11) nor to OHS cost of prevention in 2001 (Beta -0.001, 95%CI: -0.00 to 0.00).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We did not find a relation between the company's economic performance and expenditure on OHS in Finland. We suppose that this is due to legislation obliging employers to provide OHS and the reimbursement system both being strong incentives for employers.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-9-156,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19725952/,economics
"During the last 10 years, the management of gynecological cancer has been undergoing a great deal of change. This is due to a drive to reduce ineffective treatment and associated morbidity while at the same time maximizing the benefits of currently available treatment. The foundation for this approach has been high-quality clinical trials which have been performed in increasing numbers. These trials can provide strong evidence that treatments are equivalent or that a new drug adds superiority to previous treatment. The access that women have to the most effective forms of treatment often depends on the availability of healthcare resources and their affordability within the healthcare system. Healthcare decision makers increasingly require not just clinical effectiveness of treatments but also cost-effectiveness to be demonstrated. While health economic methods have been applied to many forms of cancer treatment and screening, there have been very few rigorous economic studies performed in gynecological cancer. This article discusses how economic analysis can be incorporated into clinical trials and how it can provide the sort of value for money determination that payers of healthcare are now requiring. Economic analysis may add a little to the cost of trials, but in the end, it may increase access to treatment by convincing decision makers of cost-effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1048-891x.2004.014506.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15361182/,economics
"Pharmaceutical spending in many countries has seen a steep increase in recent years. Governments have adopted several measures to reduce pharmaceutical expenditure growth, ranging from increased co-payments to price decreases determined administratively. Promotion of generic consumption has also ranked high in political priorities. We adopt a novel time series approach to the detection of which policy measures have a noticeable impact. The number and timing of the structural breaks are endogenously determined. As an illustration, we assess the overall impact of the several policy measures on total pharmaceutical spending, using monthly data from January 1995 to August 2008 for the Portuguese market. Our findings suggest that, in general, policy measures aimed at controlling pharmaceutical expenditure have been unsuccessful. Two breaks that were identified coincide with administratively determined price decreases. Measures aimed at increasing competition in the market had no visible effect on the dynamics of Government spending in pharmaceutical products. In particular, the introduction of reference pricing had only a transitory effect of less than one year, with historical growth resuming quickly. The consequence of this policy ineffectiveness is a transfer of financial burden from the Government to the patients, with no apparent effect on the dynamics of total pharmaceutical spending.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20621744/,economics
"In this work, the values of decentralized (onsite) systems that avoid investments in idle capacity within wastewater plans are quantitatively justified using the specific net present value (SNPV) approach. SNPV is a currently proposed criterion in environmental engineering economics that is defined as the net present value of the cost per unit of service or per population equivalent (PE). The SNPV approach was reintroduced with bugs fixed and then applied to the economic analysis of the capital and operating costs of one-stage completed central plants, stage-expanded central plants, and decentralized treatment facilities. The results show that under a demand growth scenario, the central plant will inevitably reach idle capacity, which can be reduced by a staged expansion. However, the staged expansion plan will lose the economies of scale and, hence, is only viable under projections of a low or moderate price inflation rate or high demand growth rate. Onsite treatment systems can theoretically achieve 100% utilization. Assuming that the capital costs per PE of the onsite and central systems are equal, the former is economically favorable in most cases of price inflation as a result of its cost saving on idle capacity. Onsite treatment systems can be viable even though their capital expenditures per PE are higher than that of a comparable centralized option as to a capital investment. This finding suggests wide opening of onsite technology choices. Use of the SNPV showed that average operating expenses of centralized plants decrease as demand growth rates increase as a benefit of economies of scale, whereas those of onsite treatment systems depend only on price inflation. Semi-decentralized systems feature both the financial advantage of the onsite system (capital investment) and the superiority of centralized systems (operation and maintenance); thus, it is worth consideration. The results of this study illustrate not only the value of decentralized systems but also the value of the SNPV approach in the planning of wastewater services, especially in areas undergoing high demand growth.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.01.038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24565878/,economics
"A discussion is presented of cost and benefit considerations in establishing digital radiology systems and an approach to assessment of such factors. Costs of digital radiology systems need to be defined and compared appropriately. Assessments should consider capital and replacement costs, but also less tangible items such as effects on staff and training requirements, hospital infrastructure, productivity, file integrity and diagnostic accuracy. Benefits of digital radiology systems could be assessed using cost-benefit and social audit analysis techniques, yielding a matrix of monetary items and also summaries of non-monetary benefits. Such analysis would define the major participants in the digital radiology process and the nature of their interests and assess the costs and benefits impacting on each of them. Economic evaluation of digital radiology to date has focused on the cost side of the appraisal. Analyses of benefits of digital radiology systems have been limited and have given inconclusive results. There is a need for better definition of comparative costs and benefits to inform interested parties, including hospital staff and health policy makers. Such economic analysis is an important way of asking the right questions about resource usage and could usually be carried out in a pilot setting before there is wider diffusion of digital radiology systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0020-7101(92)90058-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1551733/,economics
"Previous studies evaluating workers' compensation care systems used retrospective controls. We performed a concurrent effectiveness study comparing a WC system that used visiting musculoskeletal specialists to assist primary care physicians with a typical discounted-fee, WC, managed-care system. In the new specialist-direct system, physicians could not profit from self-referral, but were paid 35% to 69% more per patient visit than doctors in the discounted-fee clinics. All claims filed by all employees of two hotels for 2 years were examined. Patients had self-selected either a specialist-direct or a discounted-fee clinic, and the entire cost of the claim was assigned to either system of care. Claim costs were 63% lower in the specialist-direct system (P < 0.001). Medical costs were 45% less (P < 0.014), and indemnity 85% less (P < 0.001), in this system. Claims were closed nearly 6 months faster in the specialist-direct system (P < 0.0001). Indemnity claims were more common in the discounted-fee system (P < 0.0001). Claimant and injury characteristics were not significantly different between the systems. This new care model is a cost-effective alternative to discounted WC managed care.

"Air quality is a social, economical, and health issue for fast-developing countries such as China. Due to the overuse of nonrenewable energy, industrialization, and the population put pressure on air quality, which seriously threatens public health and economic growth. This study focuses on air quality and also aims to investigate the short-and long-run correlation between foreign direct investment, energy consumption, domestic credit, and financial development. The Autoregressive distributed lag model and the Granger non-causality test were carried out over the period from 1985 to 2018. The main findings of this study show a positive and significant long-run impact of energy consumption on air quality. In addition, domestic credit and financial development similarly show a significant positive short-run association with air quality. Moreover, the unidirectional causality correlation running from foreign direct investment and domestic credit to air quality was concluded by the Granger non-causality test. Considering the empirical analysis, this study suggests that domestic financial institutions should offer credit to industries at a low-interest rate in order to help them to switch from non-renewable to renewable energy consumption towards the promotion of sustainable and healthy air quality.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450298/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Health systems in low and lower-middle income countries, particularly in sub-Sahara Africa, often lack the specialized personnel and infrastructure to provide comprehensive care for elderly/ageing populations. Close-to-client community-based approaches are a low-cost way of providing basic care and social support for elderly populations in such resource-constrained settings and family caregivers play a crucial role in that regard. However, family caregiving duties are often unremunerated and their care-related economic burden is often overlooked though this knowledge is important in designing or scaling up effective interventions. The objective of this study, therefore, was to estimate the economic burden of family caregiving for the elderly in southern Ghana.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was a retrospective cross-sectional cost-of-care study conducted in 2015 among family caregivers for elderly registered for a support group in a peri-urban district in southern Ghana. A simple random sample of 98 respondents representative of the support group members completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Costs were assessed over a 1-month period. Direct costs of caregiving (including out-of-pocket costs incurred on health care) as well as productivity losses (i.e. indirect cost) to caregivers were analysed. Intangible costs were assessed using the 12-item Zarit burden interview (ZBI) tool and the financial cost dimension of the cost of care index.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The estimated average cost of caregiving per month was US$186.18, 66% of which was direct cost. About 78% of the family caregivers in the study reported a high level of caregiving burden (as measured with the ZBI) with females reporting a relatively higher level than males. Further, about 87% of the family caregivers reported a high level of financial stress as a result of caregiving for their elderly relative.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The study shows that support/caregiving for elderly populations imposes economic burden on families, potentially influencing the economic position of families with attendant implications for equity and future family support for such vulnerable populations.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-016-0511-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28088236/,economics

"Existing evidence shows that lower incomes are associated with higher mortality risks. This paper examines the implications for fatalities when the relationship is interpreted as an induced relationship, meaning that lower incomes will on average lead to higher mortality risks. A model is developed for estimating the number of fatalities possibly induced by economic expenditures. This model accounts for different allocations of the expenditures on family units with varying income levels. Illustrative calculations provide insights about the possible significance of fatalities induced by economic expenditures. These results suggest that some expensive regulations and programs intended to save lives may actually lead to increased fatalities.

"This article provides a broad outline of developments in the Dutch health-care policy related to the costs, budgeting, and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals. In-hospital drugs costs are part of hospital budgets, whereas for the main part of costs, nonhospital drugs, no strict budget exists. The government sets a goal for the annual cost increase of nonhospital drugs, but has only limited means to enforce that goal. Two measures were implemented to reduce drug prices: a reference price system and a price law. Both measures had a modest and temporary impact on drug prices during the 1990s. In limiting the utilization of drugs, the package of reimbursed drugs has been restricted. This led to a shift from public to private costs and possible substitution of cheaper not reimbursed drugs by more expensive reimbursed drugs. An electronic prescription system was implemented to encourage rational prescription. Although 70% of the Dutch general practitioners reported to use the system, the estimated savings on drug costs appear to be modest and far less than expected. The use of economic evaluation for reimbursement decisions will increase. From 2005 onward a pharmacoeconomic study and budget impact analysis is formally required for new nonclustered drugs seeking a premium price. Furthermore, in the future the health-care insurers will get a more prominent role in limiting the costs of drugs and enhancing the efficient use of drugs within their overall budgets. Health-care insurers may choose which drugs to purchase and reimburse and they can negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry, wholesalers, and local pharmacists.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1524-4733.6.s1.5.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12846925/,economics
"In this paper we investigate the relationship between health care provider objectives, cost-shifting, and prices by exploring the relationship between state Medicaid pharmacy reimbursements and average prices paid by pharmacy retail customers for four distinct pharmaceutical products across the US in 1994. We develop a more general theory than past researchers to enable provider objectives to vary with Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement levels. We find that provider objectives and the direction of relationship between Medicaid pharmacy reimbursements and retail prices vary with Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement levels. At high Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement levels we find a consistent negative relationship across products. At low Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement levels, the direction of the relationship is product-specific. As a result, policy-makers should be aware that policies affecting reimbursements from government-sponsored health insurance will also affect retail customers that include the uninsured. Paradoxically, for certain products if a state cuts a generous Medicaid reimbursement level this could hurt uninsured patients, whereas cuts in a stingy Medicaid reimbursement rate may help uninsured patients.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199903)8:2<137::aid-hec412>3.0.co;2-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10342727/,economics
"Recently the decision-making committee of the compulsory Swiss accident insurance scheme needed to make a basic decision as to whether to fund hand transplantation under that scheme or not. A Health Technology Assessment was commissioned to inform decision-making and gain experience with applicability of the method. The following were main findings from various domains. Compared with prosthesis fitting, the outcome of hand transplantation is satisfactory for function and sensibility. Complications due to immunosuppression are frequent, sometimes severe and potentially life-shortening. The direct medical costs over the entire life span calculated for a 35-year-old unilaterally amputated base case patient were CHF 528,600 (EUR 438,500) higher than for a prosthesis. There are challenging ethical, legal and organizational issues. The committee decided not to reimburse hand transplantation for ethical reasons. The Health Technology Assessment has been shown to be a useful tool for decision-making in the context of Swiss accident insurance.

"This paper uses metropolitan data to test empirically if health insurers possess monopsony or monopoly-busting power on the buyer-side of the hospital services market. According to theory, monopsony power is indicated by a fall in output, whereas, monopoly-busting power is shown by an increase in output when buyer concentration rises. The empirical results provide evidence that greater health insurer buyer concentration is not associated with monopsony power. Instead, some evidence is found to suggest that higher health insurer concentration translates into increased monopoly-busting power. That is, metropolitan hospitals offer increased services when the buyer-side of the hospitals services market is more highly concentrated.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-007-9026-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17638072/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      To estimate the direct and indirect costs of three cataract surgery procedures: extracapsular cataract extraction with intra-ocular lens implantation (ECCE-IOL), phacoemulsification (PHACO) and manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) using economic costing principles in a well-established eye care programme (Aravind Eye Hospital) in Tamil Nadu, South India during 2000-01. Previous literature suggests that PHACO and MSICS have similar effectiveness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The average unit cost for each surgical procedure was calculated from the societal perspective using economic costing methods. Total annual provider's direct costs for each input to surgery were calculated and apportioned appropriately to different cataract surgery techniques using a 'micro-costing approach'. The patient's direct and indirect costs for each procedure were calculated by interviewing staff and patients and by using assumptions about prices for relevant cost items such as transportation, food, medicine, spectacles and economic productivity loss.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Average provider's direct costs were highest for PHACO procedures (25.55 US dollars) compared to MSICS (17.03 US dollars) and ECCE-IOL (16.25 US dollars). The difference can be attributed to the cost of equipment and materials. Average direct and indirect patient costs were highest for ECCE-IOL (19.85 US dollars), while the costs for PHACO and MSICS were identical (12.37 US dollars). ECCE-IOL had the highest total costs and MSICS had the lowest total costs from the societal perspective.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results suggest that MSICS may have a lower societal cost than other options. Government and NGO hospitals providing cataract surgeries should invest in regular cost analyses, reviews of the literature on effectiveness, and formal cost-effectiveness analyses in order to plan economically efficient interventions. Considering the small incremental cost for providers (less than 1 US dollar), improved outcomes, and lower patient costs, we also believe that MSICS is an important technique to use in efforts to eliminate cataract blindness in India and this result may be generalised to other developing countries.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09286580490888762,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590584/,economics
"Economic evaluation using dynamic transmission models is important for capturing the indirect effects of infectious disease interventions. We examine the use of these methods in low- and middle-income countries, where infectious diseases constitute a major burden. This review is comprised of two parts: (1) a summary of dynamic transmission economic evaluations across all disease areas published between 2011 and mid-2014 and (2) an in-depth review of mosquito-borne disease studies focusing on health economic methods and reporting. Studies were identified through a systematic search of the MEDLINE database and supplemented by reference list screening. Fifty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion in the all-disease review. The most common subject disease was HIV/AIDS, followed by malaria. A diverse range of modelling methods, outcome metrics and sensitivity analyses were used, indicating little standardisation. Seventeen studies were included in the mosquito-borne disease review. With notable exceptions, most studies did not employ economic evaluation methods beyond calculating a cost-effectiveness ratio or net benefit. Many did not adhere to health care economic evaluations reporting guidelines, particularly with respect to full model reporting and uncertainty analysis.

"Background:
        
      
      Economic evaluations of health interventions pose a particular challenge for reporting because substantial information must be conveyed to allow scrutiny of study findings. Despite a growth in published reports, existing reporting guidelines are not widely adopted. There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user-friendly manner. A checklist is one way to help authors, editors, and peer reviewers use guidelines to improve reporting.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The task force's overall goal was to provide recommendations to optimize the reporting of health economic evaluations. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines into one current, useful reporting guidance. The CHEERS Elaboration and Explanation Report of the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices Task Force facilitates the use of the CHEERS statement by providing examples and explanations for each recommendation. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. Previously published checklists or guidance documents related to reporting economic evaluations were identified from a systematic review and subsequent survey of task force members. A list of possible items from these efforts was created. A two-round, modified Delphi Panel with representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, and government, as well as the editorial community, was used to identify a minimum set of items important for reporting from the larger list.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed, with some specific recommendations for single study-based and model-based economic evaluations. The final recommendations are subdivided into six main categories: 1) title and abstract, 2) introduction, 3) methods, 4) results, 5) discussion, and 6) other. The recommendations are contained in the CHEERS statement, a user-friendly 24-item checklist. The task force report provides explanation and elaboration, as well as an example for each recommendation. The ISPOR CHEERS statement is available online via Value in Health or the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices - CHEERS Task Force webpage (http://www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We hope that the ISPOR CHEERS statement and the accompanying task force report guidance will lead to more consistent and transparent reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate wider dissemination and uptake of this guidance, we are copublishing the CHEERS statement across 10 health economics and medical journals.

"Objective:
        
      
      Type 1 diabetes in childhood is increasing worldwide. Several therapy components and models of pediatric diabetes care have been introduced. Economic aspects are of increasing interest to decide appropriate strategies in clinical practice. However, knowledge in pediatric diabetes is limited.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a literature research to identify and describe systematically recently published analyses on the economics of pediatric diabetes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We substracted ten analyses. Four were cost of illness studies. The main result is that hospitalization, mainly due to metabolic control, education, and acute complications, seems to be a large cost component. Only one study took the perspective of society, including indirect costs. Four of the six studies which evaluated interventions in pediatric diabetes care focussed on ambulatory or home care strategies. Detailed evaluation of new technologies, pharmacotherapy, or screening for late complications is lacking. Except one, all studies performed cost comparison analyses. Evidence is limited, however, diabetes care models may be effective and, possibly, cost saving compared to routine care.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Health economic studies in pediatric diabetes are scarse and limited with respect to topics and quality. Hospitalization has a large impact on health care costs in diabetic children and adolescents. Models in pediatric diabetes care like home intervention may be cost effective compared to more traditional strategies of care. However, further studies are warranted which evaluate clinical and cost effectiveness in pediatric diabetes.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-981659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17647143/,economics
"This paper examines whether changes in medical markets may be making them more like other markets. The emergence of HMOs and other managed care systems appears to have increased the consumer's potential ability to make better comparative judgments about the price and quality of medical care, and also seems to have made medical care more like other goods. However, the evidence that medical care is a ""reputation good"" suggests that it is, in this respect, different from other goods. Finally, the social concerns about medical care use necessarily make medical care different.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-13-2-227,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3385166/,economics
"Many policy makers believe that when Medicare constrains its payment rates for hospital inpatient care, private insurers end up paying higher rates as a result. I tested this ""cost-shifting"" theory using a unique new data set that combines MarketScan private claims data with Medicare hospital cost reports. Contrary to the theory, I found that hospital markets with relatively slow growth in Medicare inpatient hospital payment rates also had relatively slow growth in private hospital payment rates during 1995-2009. Using regression analyses, I found that a 10 percent reduction in Medicare payment rates led to an estimated reduction in private payment rates of 3 percent or 8 percent, depending on the statistical model used. These payment rate spillovers may reflect an effort by hospitals to rein in their operating costs in the face of lower Medicare payment rates. Alternatively, hospitals facing cuts in Medicare payment rates may also cut the payment rates they seek from private payers to attract more privately insured patients. My findings indicate that repealing cuts in Medicare payment rates would not slow the growth in spending on hospital care by private insurers and would in fact be likely to accelerate the growth in private insurers' costs and premiums.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650328/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      This study estimates the healthcare costs associated with breast cancer (BC) for different treatment phases (initial, intermediate, terminal) in Germany from the payer's perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The analysis uses claims data from the AOK Bayern covering 2011-2014 for continuously insured BC patients identified through inpatient and outpatient diagnoses. We calculate the healthcare costs attributable to BC using a control group design comparing the target population to a 1:2 matched control group adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidities. For incident and prevalent BC cases, we calculate age-standardized phase-specific incremental costs stratified by cost domain.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The initial, intermediate, and terminal phases comprise 3841, 28,315, and 1767 BC cases, respectively. BC-related incremental costs follow a u-shaped curve, with costs highest near diagnosis and death, and lower in between. With average costs of €33,237 per incident and €28,211 per prevalent case in the remaining 11 months before death, the highest BC-related incremental healthcare costs can be found in the terminal phase. In the initial phase, there were mean incremental costs of €21,455 the first 11 months after diagnosis. In the intermediate phase, incremental costs totaled €2851 per incident and €2387 per prevalent case per year. Healthcare costs decreased with age in most phases. The cost drivers depend on the treatment phase, with cytostatic drugs and inpatient treatment showing the highest economic impact in most phases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The study concludes that BC care costs impose a relevant economic burden on statutory health insurance and vary substantially depending on the treatment phase.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-019-01148-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31897812/,economics
"American medicine is financed today by a patchwork of systems formed around a concept of competitive voluntary health insurance that evolved over the past 50 years. This article reviews the theory of health insurance from a clinical perspective to examine whether changes in medical science and practice have made such an insurance system obsolete. As it is currently applied, a system of competitive voluntary health insurance conflicts with the goals of modern medical practice due to advances in screening and in treatment and the need to deal more effectively with paying for care of unknown efficacy. Proposals to reform health insurance must deal with the medical failings of competitive voluntary health insurance and should do more than simply extend the current system to cover more Americans.",https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.153.4.457,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8435025/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Many analysts believe that the lack of coverage for outpatient prescription medications represents a conspicuous deficiency in the Medicare benefits package.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This paper uses insurance theory to design and estimate the costs of a Medicare catastrophic-medication outpatient benefit.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For efficiency and equity purposes, and to accommodate the tradeoff between the cost to the federal government and the insurance value of such a benefit to Medicare enrollees, we favor a benefit that would be means-tested by employing deductibles, coinsurance rates, and catastrophic limits, all of which would be progressively graduated for 7 household income classes. For equity reasons, we propose that the government's share of the medication benefit be financed from the general tax fund, using the progressive income tax. Another source of potential savings within the Medicare program that could pay for a medication benefit would be elimination of fraud, waste, and abuse.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Because our proposal addresses both the efficiency and equity dimensions of a Medicare outpatient medication benefit, we believe it is worthy of serious consideration by both policymakers and Congress.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0149-2918(00)89014-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10823367/,economics

"Measurement of health care costs is a crucial task in health economic evaluation. Various guidelines with different amount of details have been set up for costing methods in economic evaluation which, however, do not precisely stipulate how to value resource consumption. In this article we present a proposal for the standardisation of the monetary valuation of health care utilisation occurring in the follow up period after the actual intervention to be evaluated. From a societal perspective the primary direct and indirect cost components are considered, such as outpatient medical care, pharmaceuticals, non-physician health services, inpatient care, days of sick leave and early retirement due to sickness. The standard costs are based on administrative charges and rates or on official statistics. They are based on the most current data sources which are mainly from 2002 and 2003. This system of standard costs aims at an average valuation of resource consumption. This makes for the comparability of different health economic studies. Most standard costs are not based on market prices but on administratively specified charges and rates. This implies that institutional changes which are quite common in the health care system, may also affect the valuation rates, for example the introduction of DRGs. This should be taken into account when updating the system of standard costs.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2005-858698,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235143/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Even though China launched a series of measures to alleviate several financial burdens (including health insurance scheme, increased government investment, and so on), the economic burden of health expenditure has still not been alleviated. Out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) show not only a time correlation but also some degree of spatial correlation. The aims of the current study were thus to identify the spatial cluster of OPPs, to investigate the main factors affecting variation, and to explore the spatial spillover sources of China's OPP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Global and local spatial autocorrelation tests were validated to identify the spatial cluster of OPPs using the panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2005 to 2016. The Spatial Durbin Model, established in this paper, measured the spatial spillover effect of OPPs and analyzed the possible spillover sources (demand, supply, and socio-economic factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      OPPs were found to have a significant and positive spatial correlation. The results of the Spatial Durbin Model showed the direct and indirect effects of demand, supply, and socio- economic factors on China's OPPs. Among the demand factors, the direct and indirect correlation (elasticity) coefficients were positive. Among the supply factors, the direct and indirect effects of the share of primary health beds on residents' OPPs were negative. The ratio of health technicians in hospitals to those in primary health institutions on per capital OPPs had a significant indirect effect. Among the socio-economic factors, the direct effects of GDP, government health expenditure, and urbanization on OPPs were found to be positive. There were no significant indirect effects of socio-economic factors on OPPs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This paper finds that China's OPPs are not randomly distributed but, overall, present a positive spatial cluster, even though a series of measures have been launched to promote health equity. Socio-economic factors and those associated with demand were found to be the main influences of variation in OPPs, while demand was seen to be the driver of the positive spatial spillover of OPPs, whereby effective supply could inhibit these positive spillover effects.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4451-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31470846/,economics
"Despite increasing consensus about the value of depression disease management programs, the field has not identified which stakeholders should absorb the relatively small additional costs associated with these programs. This paper investigates whether two proposed stakeholders (health plans and employer purchasers) economically benefit from depression care management (reduced outpatient utilization and work costs, respectively) in two delivery systems (rural and urban). This study examined the main and differential effects of depression care management on outpatient utilization and work costs over 24 months in a preplanned secondary analysis of 479 depressed patients from rural and urban primary care practices in a randomized controlled trial. Over 24 months, the intervention did not significantly reduce outpatient utilization costs in the entire cohort (-$191, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-$2,083 to $1,647), but it did decrease work costs (-$1,970, 95% CI=-$3,934 to -$92). While not statistically significant, rural-urban differences in work costs were in the same direction, while rural-urban differences in utilization costs differed in direction. These findings provide preliminary evidence that employers who elect to cover depression care management costs should receive comparable economic benefits in the rural and urban employees they insure. Given the limited sample size, further research may be needed to determine whether health plans who elect to cover depression care management costs will receive comparable economic benefits in the rural and urban enrollees they insure.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11414-009-9204-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20052619/,economics

"Documented launch delays and the ensuing debate over their underlying causes have focused on assessment from the individual country's perspective. Seen in a larger game theoretical framework this may cause problems, because although the countries see an individual game, the pharmaceutical firm sees a repeated linked game. The links are due to external reference pricing and parallel trade. Behaviours that are optimal in the single, individual game (for either the country or the pharmaceutical firm) may no longer be optimal when considering the global repeated game. A theoretical mixed integer linear model of the firm's launch and pricing decisions is presented along with examples wherein international price dependencies most likely played a role. This model can help countries understand the implication of their external reference pricing policies on the global repeated pricing game. Understanding the behaviour of the pharmaceutical firm in this global context aids countries in designing policies to maximize the welfare of their citizens.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200826080-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18620459/,economics

"The Belgian Law of 20 July 2007 has drastically changed the Belgian private health insurance sector by making individual contracts lifelong with the technical basis (i.e. actuarial assumptions) fixed at policy issue. The goal of the Law is to ensure the accessibility to supplementary health coverage in order to protect policyholders from discrimination and exclusion, essentially when these operate on the basis of age. Due to the unpredictable nature of medical inflation risk and the difficulty to model future increases of health claims, the legislator introduced medical indices together with a specific updating mechanism, which aim at establishing standardized and fair premium adjustments across the sector. This paper considers two major issues of the current Belgian system. The first one is related to the transferability of the reserves, whereas the second one is related to age-discrimination.

"Introduction:
        
      
      A prospective payment system per DRG is announced in Belgium. Is this kind of financing system adequate for oncology? Objectives of this study are: to analyze medical and economical characteristics of oncological inpatients and evaluate the homogeneity of costs and length of stay per DRG.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was realized in 14 Belgian hospitals, with 2010 data. Inpatients with primary diagnosis of neoplasms were selected in medical and administrative databases. Characteristics of patients as well as length of stay and cost (hospital perspective) were analyzed. The homogeneity of costs and length of stay is measured by calculating the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The length of stay (standard deviation) is 9.72 days (12.64). The variation is high per DRG. The average cost (standard deviation) is 7689.28€ (10,418) and is also variable from one DRG to another one. There are 5% of high-length of stay outliers and 0.2% of low-length of stay outliers. There are 4.7% of high-cost outliers and 0.2% of low-cost outliers. The withdrawal of outliers improves the homogeneity of cost and length of stay per APR-DRG.
    


          Discussion and conclusion:
        
      
      There is a homogeneity of costs and length of stay per DRG and per severity of illness. A prospective payment system per DRG would probably be applicable for these patients. It is however necessary to plan an appropriate and additional financing of all elements susceptible to stimulate innovation in the management of oncology and to stimulate the quality of care by adding financial stimulants.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bulcan.2015.08.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26497276/,economics
"Competition among hospitals is commonly regarded as inefficient due to the medical arms race phenomenon, but most evidence for this hypothesis predates the Medicare prospective payment system and preferred provider legislation. Recent studies indicate hospital competition reduces costs and prices, but nearly all such research has focused on California. We add to the body of literature that analyzes the effects of competition in hospital markets. Using data from the state of Washington, we show that hospitals assume more risk in competitive markets by being more likely to accept prospective payment arrangements with insurers. If the arrangement is retrospective, the hospital is more likely to offer a discount as the number of competing hospitals increases. Both findings indicate that competitive forces operate the same in hospital markets as in most others: as the number of competitors increases, prices decrease and market power shifts from the suppliers to purchasers. The medical arms race hypothesis that favors more concentrated hospital markets no longer appears to be valid.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_39.1.45,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12067074/,economics
"The use of information on inflation, pharmacoeconomics, generic competition, new drug entities, site-specific drug-use patterns, legislation, and the changing health care environment in the projection of drug expenditures is discussed. Drug price inflation has declined from 6.9% in 1991 to 2.1% for part of 1995. Much of the decline is attributable to deep discounts given by manufacturers to managed care institutions. Some marketing specialists are predicting that drug manufacturers will begin to scale back discounts. Pharmaceutical industry analysts project that overall price increase for pharmaceuticals in the next 12-24 months will average 2.8% (range, 0-6%). Pharmacists need to be able to understand and critically evaluate pharmacoeconomic research, particularly studies conducted by the pharmaceutical industry. Savings due to increases in generic product selection may be offset to some degree by extensions of patent expiration dates under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Drug budget projections should include a complete review of new drugs and biotechnology agents pending FDA approval, drugs pending approval for new indications, and common unlabeled uses of expensive existing agents. Various methods are available for tracking drug-use patterns in specific practice settings. When resources are limited, pharmacy managers may elect to target only high-cost drugs; a proactive approach, such as projecting costs and developing guidelines for costly agents before their market release and before consideration by the pharmacy and therapeutics committee, is advantageous. Relevant legislative activities in 1995 included reform proposals for Medicare, Medicaid, and FDA; the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act; and GATT. Disease management and other approaches to pharmacy benefits have increased opportunities for cooperative arrangements between drug companies and health care providers that may have major effects on drug marketing and pricing. Combining information on inflation, pharmacoeconomics, generics, new drugs, practice-site drug-use patterns, federal legislation, and the changing health care environment is necessary for accurate projections of drug expenditures.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/53.2.139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653479/,economics
"Interprofessional student clinics can be used to create clinical education placements for health professional students in addition to traditional hospital-based placements and present an opportunity to provide interprofessional learning experiences in a clinical context. To date, little consideration has been given in research literature as to whether such clinics are economically viable for a university to run. We conducted an economic evaluation based upon data generated during a pilot of an interprofessional student clinic based in Australia. Cost-minimization analyses of the student clinic as opposed to traditional profession-specific clinical education in hospitals were conducted from university, Commonwealth Government, state government and societal perspectives. Cost data gathered during the pilot study and market prices were used where available, while $AUD currency at 2011 values were used. Per student day of clinical education, the student clinic cost an additional $289, whereas the state government saved $49 and the Commonwealth Government saved $66. Overall, society paid an additional $175 per student day of clinical education using the student clinic as opposed to conventional hospital-based placements, indicating that traditional hospital-based placements are a cost-minimizing approach overall for providing clinical education. Although interprofessional student clinics have reported positive patient and student learning outcomes, further research is required to determine if these benefits can justify the additional cost of this model of education.

"Objective:
        
      
      To compare the economic implications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and contact-laser vaporization of the prostate (with the SLT system) using data obtained from a randomized controlled trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All aspects of management before, during and after surgery on 102 patients, followed up for 3 months, were costed and analysed. Based on the data from the trial, the mean costs were calculated. A sensitivity analysis was then performed to examine the effect of changes in some of the relevant variables. The mean difference in cost between laser treatment and TURP was plotted against the cost of laser consumables, assuming a 5% re-operation rate for both operations at 5 years and a 5% discount rate. A range of laser re-operation rates was compared with the mean difference in costs, assuming a hospital stay of one night and two district-nurse visits. Other assumptions on discounts and re-operation rates, based on collected data, were also tested.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TURP will remain more economical until the cost of laser consumables is reduced to 20% of the current list price, or a hospital stay of one night is introduced.

      The costs of contact-laser vaporization of the prostate are likely to exceed the costs of TURP unless laser treatment is accompanied by a more active approach to post-operative management, including a hospital stay of one night and, if necessary, the removal of the patient's catheter at home by a district nurse.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1996.81811.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8814843/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that the ""severity effect""-the preference for more than utility-maximizing expenditure on severe health states-may be the result of, or exacerbated by, the uncertainty associated with the chance of contracting the illness that causes the severe health state.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Survey respondents were asked to imagine that they will contract one of two illnesses and asked to allocate a budget between two insurance policies, each of which provides services for the treatment of one of the illnesses. A person's final health state varied with the amount of insurance purchased for the illness that occurred and therefore with the level of treatment. The relative cost of the two policies was altered and the selected levels of insurance compared with the levels that would be provided by a health authority that sought to maximize total utility or quality-adjusted life-years from its own budget.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Respondents selected more than utility-maximizing insurance for protection against severe health states. A number of psychological factors that affect measurement under uncertainty do not affect utility as currently measured. This difference may explain the present results and also explain the ""severity paradox"" that personal preferences as presently measured imply less expenditure on severe health states than do ""social preferences"" for the treatment of strangers.

"Therapeutic noncompliance is a major issue in health care, having important negative consequences for clinical outcome as well as for health-care costs. This paper reviews the literature on the economics of therapeutic noncompliance, identifies methodological shortcomings and formulates recommendations for future economic research in this area. Medication noncompliance was explored more extensively, as the majority of articles dealt exclusively with this aspect of therapy. Eighteen studies were assessed according to their definition and measurement of medication noncompliance, study design, and identification and valuation of costs and outcomes. Very diverse designs and often invalid methods for calculating costs were found. Medication noncompliance is often ill-defined and measured in an inaccurate way. The economic consequences of therapeutic noncompliance have rarely been investigated according to the standard principles of good economic evaluation. Six studies examined both costs and consequences of noncompliance in a cost-outcome description or a cost-benefits, cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis. Eight studies dealt with the economic value of compliance-enhancing interventions. In general, studies on the economic consequences of noncompliance lack methodological rigour and fail to meet qualitative standards. There is a clear need for more and better research on the impact of noncompliance, on the cost-effectiveness of interventions and the potential of compliance-enhancing interventions to improve patient outcomes and/or reduce health-care costs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(01)00178-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11786175/,economics

          Study design:
        
      
      The main outcome measures were mean price differentials and other measures of price dispersion within European Union countries compared with within non-European Union countries.
    


          Data collection/extraction methods:
        
      
      We identified drugs subject to parallel trade using information provided by IMS and by checking membership lists of parallel import trade associations and lists of approved parallel imports.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      Parallel trade was not associated with substantial reductions in price dispersion in European Union countries. In descriptive and regression analyses, about half of the price differentials exceeded 50 percent in both European Union and non-European Union countries over time, and price distributions among European Union countries did not show a dramatic change concurrent with the adoption of parallel trade. In regression analysis, we found that although price differentials decreased after 1995 in most countries, they decreased less in the European Union than elsewhere.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Parallel trade for prescription drugs does not automatically reduce international price differences. Future research should explore how other regulatory schemes might lead to different results elsewhere.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2008.00838.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18355258/,economics
"With the revitalization of the old industrial bases in Northeast China, the development of the energy industry is particularly significative. The purpose of this paper is analyzing the decoupling of carbon emissions and placing emphasis on Liaoning's energy industry. The researchers used the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decompose model to take into account carbon emissions in each energy industry and used the Tapio decoupling model from 2000 to 2015 to seek the decoupling states. The main completion of this study are as follows: (1) The EGH and OPC industry are the dominating components of the carbon emissions of the energy industry. The coal and crude oil accounted for 95% of energy industrial consumption; there is great potential for electricity to replace coal and crude oil. (2) The direction of the changes in economic growth, investment structure, investment dependence, and energy structure is the same as industrial carbon emissions. Meanwhile, energy intensity and energy technology are the opposite during the period. (3) The CMW and PGE industry occurred strong decoupling between carbon emissions and economic output since 2005; there is weak decoupling state in other industry. And the PGE and OPC industry occurred recessive coupling and weak negative decoupling between carbon emissions and energy intensity except 2011 and 2012.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04693-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30877535/,economics
"Decision-making in healthcare is a priority-setting process. Tools used in health economic evaluation support decision-making by outlining complex interdependences, simulating short- and long-term consequences, and quantifying formal comparisons of health technologies. Key elements in health economic evaluations are patient-relevant outcomes and cost parameters. Costing of healthcare services is demanding and reflects only an approximation to reality, particularly in Germany, as the reimbursement schemes neither fully provide all details nor the different costing perspectives. Hence, in order to obtain uniform and cross-indication applicable cost parameters, a German standard cost dataset is necessary. In addition, patient-relevant and indication-specific sets of outcomes parameters should be agreed upon in order to also enable a reliable clinical product development. Economic aspects could be applied in a two-step decision-making approach, where initially the anticipated indication-specific technical efficiency level in terms of cost per adjusted life years would be assessed from a health system perspective. The second step would employ prioritization based on indication-relevant outcomes and ranking criteria in the individual patient decision situation. Health economic evaluations are relevant tools to support prioritization of health technologies, both on an individual as well as public health level.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-010-1118-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20853085/,economics
"This work aims to provide a systematic and updated survey of original scientific studies on the effect of the introduction of reference pricing (RP) policies in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. We searched PubMed, EconLit and Web of Knowledge for articles on RP. We reviewed studies that met the inclusion criteria established in the search strategy. From a total of 468 references, we selected the 35 that met all of the inclusion criteria. Some common themes emerged in the literature. The first was that RP was generally associated with a decrease in the prices of the drugs subject to the policy. In particular, price drops seem to have been experienced in virtually every country that implemented a generic RP (GRP) policy. A GRP policy applies only to products with expired patents and generic competition, and clusters drugs according to chemical equivalence (same form and active compound). More significant price decreases were observed in the sub-markets in which drugs were already facing generic competition prior to RP. Price drops varied widely according to the amount of generic competition and industrial strategies: brand-named drugs originally priced above RP values decreased their prices to a greater extent. A second common theme was that both therapeutic RP (TRP) and GRP have been associated with significant and consistent savings in the first years of application. A third general result is that generic market shares significantly increased whenever the firms producing brand-named drugs did not adopt one of the following strategies: lowering prices to RP values; launching new dosages and/or formulations; or marketing substitute drugs still under patent protection. Finally, concerning TRP, although more evidence is needed, studies based on a large number of patient-level observations showed no association between the RP policy and health outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11537860-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21142276/,economics
"The economic realities of health sector development in Africa has been analyzed in this paper. Both the global and national macroeconomic context has been defined. Given the available data, it is clear that most African countries face increasingly serious economic realities, such as slow or even declining economic growth (per capita), a depressed food production situation, severe balance of payments crises, and increasing dependence on external financial assistance. Given the limited but increasingly available 1981 and 1982 data, the economic situation in many countries is more constrained than those indicated by the data contained in this paper. In this context, the potential competitive situation facing governmental health care systems was reviewed. In addition, the diversity in the sources of health expenditures between countries in Africa was highlighted. These data provide clear evidence that governments clearly do not finance the entire health care system and that individual payment for service in many countries represent an important source of revenue for many care providers in various health care systems operating in any given country. The potential for governments to finance either an expansion of or improvements to the government component of their health care systems is then reviewed. The highlights of this analysis include the following points. First, the tax structure in many African countries is highly dependent on export and import duties, which in turn creates dependency on sustained foreign demand for exports.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(83)90142-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6422557/,economics
"This article advocates for a regulated private monopoly as an audacious solution to replace Obamacare, help manage Medicare and Medicaid and reform the US healthcare insurance industry. Contemporary economics vilifies monopolies and praises the 'magic wand' of perfect competition without much debate on the merits of these assumptions. The problems with the perfect competition model as applied to healthcare insurance are well established, but exploration of other possible economic models (i.e. monopoly and oligopoly) as a replacement for Obamacare is non-existent. New thinking about the role of monopolies may help achieve public policy goals and make health insurance available to the largest number of people at a reasonable premium while containing medical costs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-018-0381-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29626323/,economics
"The role of nutrition to optimize the use of scarce resources through its linkage with health and welfare should be considered of interest by healthcare decision makers. A favorable impact of food on non-communicable disorders and general health status will improve healthcare expenditure and quality of life.In health economics, an analysis of the costs and effects of a healthcare technology by means of a cost-effectiveness analysis has become an established tool. Projections about the effectiveness and expected costs of an intervention can be modeled using realistic and explicit assumptions based on outcomes from randomized clinical studies. However, the use of health economic techniques to assess costs and effects is not solely restricted to classic healthcare products such as medicines. To illustrate this we used two published cost-effectiveness studies, which consider respectively a preventive treatment against severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in children at high risk of hospitalization and the use of prebiotics for the primary prevention of atopic dermatitis.These examples illustrate that there is a parallel between the methodologies for extrapolation of intermediate outcomes to long-term outcomes between a cost-effectiveness analysis for pharmaceutical or nutrition, as long as the clinical evidence for nutrition fulfils the requirements for pharmaceuticals. Another requirement is that there is clinical widely accepted evidence that matches a comparable level of epidemiological observations about the link between short-term and long-term outcomes.Better understanding of how nutritional status and behavior may interplay with the socioeconomic environment will ultimately contribute to preserving the sustainability of healthcare provisions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21810421/,economics
"How can we limit wealth disparities while stimulating economic flows in sustainable societies? To examine the link between these concepts, we propose an econophysics asset exchange model with the surplus stock of the wealthy. The wealthy are one of the two exchange agents and have more assets than the poor. Our simulation model converts the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy to a new variable parameter alongside the saving rate and introduces the total exchange (flow) and rank correlation coefficient (metabolism) as new evaluation indexes, adding to the Gini index (disparities), thereby assessing both wealth distribution and the relationships among the disparities, flow, and metabolism. We show that these result in a gamma-like wealth distribution, and our model reveals a trade-off between limiting disparities and vitalizing the market. To limit disparities and increase flow and metabolism, we also find the need to restrain savings and use the wealthy surplus stock. This relationship is explicitly expressed in the new equation introduced herein. The insights gained by uncovering the root of disparities may present a persuasive case for investments in social security measures or social businesses involving stock redistribution or sharing.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259323,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34735504/,economics
"While health insurance tax credits could help people who otherwise could not afford to purchase coverage, many might still find individual coverage too expensive and its marketplace dynamics bewildering. As an alternative, this paper outlines an approach using private purchasing pools for tax-credit recipients. The objective is to offer these individuals and families a choice among competing health plans, and provide many of the same advantages enjoyed by workers in large employer groups, such as relatively low administrative costs, no health rating, and an effective ""sponsor."" Some express optimism that private pools will emerge naturally and thrive as an option for individual tax-credit recipients. However, adverse selection and other individual health insurance market forces make this a dubious prospect. The approach presented here gives purchasing pools the same tool employer groups use to maintain stability and cohesion--a significant contribution that cannot be used elsewhere. The ability to offer health plans exclusive access to a sizable new, previously uninsured clientele--tax-credit recipients-would enable purchasing pools to attract health plan participation and thus overcome one major reason several state-directed pools for small employers have failed. To avoid other pitfalls, the paper also suggests private pool structures, as well as federal and state roles that seek to balance objectives for market innovation and choice with those for coverage-source stability and efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_38.2.159,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11529513/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Estimates of drug spending are often central to the public policy debate on how to manage healthcare spending in the United States. Nevertheless, common estimates of prescription drug spending vary substantially by source, which can inhibit productive policy dialogue.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To review publicly reported estimates of drug spending and uncover the underlying methodological inputs that drive the substantial variation in estimates of prescription drug spending.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We systematically evaluated 5 estimates of drug spending to identify differences in the underlying methodological inputs and approaches. To uniformly assess and compare estimates, we developed a model to identify the inputs of 3 primary components associated with each estimate: numerator (How is drug cost measured?), denominator (How is healthcare cost measured?), and population (What group of individuals is included in the measurement?). We then applied standardized methodological inputs to each estimate to assess whether variation among estimates could be reconciled. We then conducted a sensitivity analysis to address important limitations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that the 18.8 percentage point range in the publicly reported estimates is predominately attributed to methodological differences. Reconciling estimates using a standardized methodological approach reduces this range to 4.0 percentage points.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Because variation in estimates of drug spending is primarily driven by methodological differences, stakeholders should seek to establish a mutually agreed upon methodological approach that is appropriate for the policy question at hand to provide a sound basis for health spending policy discussions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.11.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277826/,economics
"This paper presents a model of a competitive health insurance market with two risk types and two health benefits. In the benchmark case, community rating insurers (CRIs) are only allowed to offer the basic benefit. The additional benefit is sold by risk rating insurers (RRIs). It is shown that low risk types can only be better off at the expense of high risk types if CRIs are allowed to offer the additional benefit and no additional measures are taken. However, high risk types can be made better off if CRIs must offer the additional benefit or if community rating health insurers offering the additional benefit are subsidized while those selling only the basic benefit are taxed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(02)00063-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12349879/,economics
"Critical care providers are under increasing pressure to be attentive to cost concerns. The ICU consumes a significant amount of resources and, as such, is a frequently identified target of efforts to limit escalating healthcare costs. Attempts to reduce costs need not progress in a haphazard fashion. Rather, they can proceed in a logical, systematic manner with the assistance of formal economic studies. Cost-effectiveness analysis is one tool for these projects-it allows physicians to compare the financial consequences of different approaches to resource allocation. ICU physicians, therefore, must become familiar with the basic concepts that underlie cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analyses that address many different aspects of critical care delivery are now commonly found in the critical care literature. With a framework for evaluating these studies, clinicians can better apply their findings to their own institutions.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00075198-200208000-00011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12386495/,economics
"This study investigates patterns of lay perception of economics, and in particular the place of conspiratorial thinking regarding the economic domain. We devised four types of accounts in the economic domain, over a range of questions regarding different aspects of the economy: the classical neo-liberal economic view (which we labeled Econ101), and the Conspiracy view (the destructive outcomes of economy are due to small and powerful groups who are manipulating the markets), to which we added the Government malfunction view (failures in the economy are due to the authorities), and the Bad Invisible Hand view (the invisible hand may go wrong, and the equilibrium reached by its doings may be undesirable). The last two views are the ones most strongly endorsed by our respondents, in the US, Israel and Switzerland. The pattern of inter-correlations between the four accounts, and that between each and the psycho-social variables we examined, exhibits two clusters, Econ101 vs. the other three views of economy. This corresponds to a general opposition between people who trust the neoliberal economic system, and those opposed to it.

"Background:
        
      
      Identifying heart failure patients most likely to suffer poor outcomes is an essential part of delivering interventions to those most likely to benefit. We sought a comprehensive account of heart failure events and their cumulative economic burden by examining patient characteristics that predict increased cost or poor outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We collected electronic medical data from members of a large HMO who had a heart failure diagnosis and an echocardiogram from 1999-2004, and followed them for one year. We examined the role of demographics, clinical and laboratory findings, comorbid disease and whether the heart failure was incident, as well as mortality. We used regression methods appropriate for censored cost data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 4,696 patients, 8% were incident. Several diseases were associated with significantly higher and economically relevant cost changes, including atrial fibrillation (15% higher), coronary artery disease (14% higher), chronic lung disease (29% higher), depression (36% higher), diabetes (38% higher) and hyperlipidemia (21% higher). Some factors were associated with costs in a counterintuitive fashion (i.e. lower costs in the presence of the factor) including age, ejection fraction and anemia. But anemia and ejection fraction were also associated with a higher death rate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Close control of factors that are independently associated with higher cost or poor outcomes may be important for disease management. Analysis of costs in a disease like heart failure that has a high death rate underscores the need for economic methods to consider how mortality should best be considered in costing studies.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-12-434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23194470/,economics
"This paper examines factors associated with the cesarean birth rate, including medical condition and method of payment, in the largest maternity hospital of Fortaleza, Brazil. Data were collected on 5996 women who delivered at the Maternidade Escola Assis Chateaubriand from October 1980 to July 1981. All women were classified according to how they paid for their care: private (financed at least part of their care with own funds), insured (federal or state), or indigent. Private patients were found to be far more likely than patients in the other two groups to have cesarean deliveries, due primarily to the high percentage of private patients recorded as having prolonged or obstructed labor, combined with a high rate of prior cesarean sections. From this data, it appears likely that financial incentives did play a role in physician decisions on whether to perform cesarean deliveries.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-9-3-515,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6512225/,economics
"Recent literature has been concerned with the correct measurement of the 'indirect costs and benefits' of health care as well as the issue of including these items in economic evaluations. This article considers the question of which 'indirect benefits' to include in cost effectiveness analysis and cost utility analysis. Within the context of a collectively financed health scheme the relevant issues include not only the size of the net resource costs of providing health care but also which costs and benefits the society is prepared to consider in its assessment of health services. The strong preference for 'equal access for equal need' implies that some production gains may have to be disregarded in the social welfare function. We introduce the notion of socially relevant and socially irrelevant production gains. The analysis suggests that the magnitude of the socially relevant part of the production gains may vary between countries as it depends, first, upon differences in patients' potential contributions to the rest of society (tax rates), and second, the strength of preferences for equity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00116-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10414837/,economics

"Transaction cost economics (TCE) has been the dominant economic paradigm for analysing contracting, and the framework has been applied in a number of health care contexts. However, TCE has particular limitations when applied to complex industry settings and there have been calls to extend the framework to incorporate dynamic theories of industrial organisation, specifically the resource-based view (RBV). This paper analyses how such calls for theoretical pluralism are particularly germane to health care markets and examines whether a combined TCE-RBV provides a more comprehensive approach for understanding the nature of contractual arrangements that have developed within the Australian private health care sector and its implications for informing policy. This Australian case study involved a series of interviews with 14 senior contracting executives from the seven major health funds (i.e. 97% of the insured population) and seven major private hospital groups (i.e. 73% of the private hospital beds). Study findings reveal that both the TCE perspective with its focus on exchange hazards, and the RBV approach with its emphasis on the dynamic nature of capabilities, each provide a partial explanation of the developments associated with contracting between health funds and hospital groups. For a select few organisations, close inter-firm relational ties involving trust and mutual commitment attenuate complex exchange hazards through greater information sharing and reduced propensity to behave opportunistically. Further, such close relational ties also provide denser communication channels for creating and transmitting more complex information enabling organisations to tap into each other's complementary resources and capabilities. For policymakers, having regard to both TCE and RBV considerations provides the opportunity to apply competition policy beyond the current static notions of efficiency and welfare gains, and cautions policymakers against specifying ex ante the specific nature of contractual arrangements that ought to prevail in health care markets.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20943302/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The reduction and removal of user fees for essential care services have recently become a key instrument to advance universal health coverage in sub-Saharan Africa, but no evidence exists on its cost-effectiveness. We aimed to address this gap by estimating the cost-effectiveness of 2 user-fee exemption interventions in Burkina Faso between 2007 and 2015: the national 80% user-fee reduction policy for delivery care services and the user-fee removal pilot (ie, the complete [100%] user-fee removal for delivery care) in the Sahel region.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We built a single decision tree to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 2 study interventions and the baseline. The decision tree was populated with an own impact evaluation and the best available epidemiological evidence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Relative to the baseline, both the national 80% user-fee reduction policy and the user-fee removal pilot are highly cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $210.22 and $252.51 per disability-adjusted life-year averted, respectively. Relative to the national 80% user-fee reduction policy, the user-fee removal pilot entails an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $309.74 per disability-adjusted life-year averted.
    


          Conclusions:

"For the last two decades, we have seen remarkable growth in the pharmaceutical industry. This growth has mainly been due to the approximately 100 new blockbuster drugs, such as Lipitor® (atorvastatin) and Plavix® (clopidogrel). More than half of the revenue of major pharmaceutical companies and above one-third of the total pharmaceutical revenues came from the sales of these blockbuster drugs. Questions concerning the fate of these blockbuster drugs are beginning to surface as they are approaching their patent expiration dates, and as they are expected to face significant competition from generic versions. Branded drugs with more than USD 120 billion in sales (as of 2008) are expected to lose their patent protection in the next 3 to 4 years, while the less expensive generic versions are ready to enter the market. It is plausible that a major paradigm shift in our thinking is needed to stay innovative, competitive and economically feasible in this new era of drug development. A new wave of innovations is expected to boost the blockbuster regime. Herein, we discuss the different threats facing the branded monopoly, as well as some of the hopeful expectations for the blockbuster drug.",https://doi.org/10.1358/dnp.2010.23.10.1506088,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21180653/,economics
"For cost-benefit analysis, health technologies with multiple effects should be valued in a single scenario by a holistic willingness-to-pay (WTP) measure. Recent studies instead used decomposed scenarios in which respondents report their WTP for each individual effect. Evidence can be found that the sum of such decomposed WTPs overestimates the holistic WTP, i.e. the holistic WTP is sub-additive. This sum of decomposed WTPs can lead to wrong conclusions on the efficiency of health technologies. This is also relevant in decision making about new technologies that are valued separately in different surveys. To date, no utility-theoretical and empirically validated aggregation function for decomposed WTPs exists. Within an expected utility model, this paper identifies as a reason for sub-additivity--beside risk aversion with respect to wealth--a negative influence of better health on the marginal utility of wealth, i.e. marginal utility of wealth is smaller in better health states. Assuming mutual utility independence of health and wealth, a theoretically founded aggregation function covering these two impacts is derived. In a contingent valuation study, 92 patients with diabetes were asked to state their WTP for reductions of the risk of several diabetic complications in decomposed as well as in holistic scenarios. The patients had preferences with a significant negative influence of health on the marginal utility of wealth. Sub-additivity occurred and theoretically founded aggregation could considerably lower the degree of overestimation. These results suggest that the theoretically founded aggregation function might reduce problems of sub-additivity that can be economically relevant. Further empirical testing of the approach is indicated.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.835,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15067672/,economics

There are four specific goals of the paper: (1) Discuss the importance of the social cost methodological debate and the state of research in the area; (2) Explain the Walker-Barnett definition of social cost in the context of a simple production possibilities frontier and indifference curve model; (3) Use simple illustrative examples to show why many of the alleged social costs should not be classified as such; and (4) Suggest a new method for analyzing the social costs and effects attributable to pathological gambling.",https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1023629331837,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12766468/,economics
"In estimating how economic growth depends on various inputs, economists commonly use long periods of data encompassing both main extremes to fluctuations in the economy: recession and expansion. Here we focus on recession years because during expansion even countries with bad economic policies may experience large growth. Specifically, we study how growth depends on the proportion of public-sector workforce, p and competitiveness, quantified by the Global Competitiveness Index, GCI. For the 2008-2011 economic downturn and for 57 countries, we find that the growth rate of GDP per capita, g, decreases with p, and increases with ΔGCI. Further, more competitive countries attract more foreign direct investments per capita, I, than less competitive countries, where I is proportional to GCI(α). We propose a production function, divided into the private and public sectors, where GDP depends on market capitalization, the public (private)-sector workforce, and competitiveness level, used to quantify the public sector efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1038/srep01612,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23563321/,economics
"Economic unit values of soundscape/acoustic effects have been based on changes in the number of annoyed persons or on decibel changes. The normal procedure has been the application of these unit values to noise-attenuation measures affecting the noisier fa&#231;ade of a dwelling. Novel modular vegetation-based soundscape measures, so-called green walls, might be relevant for both noisy and quieter areas. Moreover, their benefits will comprise noise attenuation as well as non-acoustic amenity effects. One challenge is to integrate the results of some decades of non-acoustic research on the amenity value of urban greenery into design of the urban sound environment, and incorporate these non-acoustic properties in the overall economic assessment of noise control and overall sound environment improvement measures. Monetised unit values for green walls have been included in two alternative cases, or demonstration projects, of covering the entrances to blocks of flats with a green wall. Since these measures improve the noise environment on the quiet side of the dwellings and courtyards, not the most exposed fa&#231;ade, adjustment factors to the nominal quiet side decibel reductions to arrive at an estimate of the equivalent overall acoustic improvement have been applied. A cost-benefit analysis of the green wall case indicates that this measure is economically promising, when valuing the noise attenuation in the quieter area and adding the amenity/aesthetic value of the green wall.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph9113770,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23202816/,economics
"Addressing the extra economic costs of disability is a logical step towards alleviating elements of social exclusion for people with disabilities. This study estimates the long-run economic cost of disability in Ireland in terms of the additional spending needs that arise due to disability. It defines and estimates models of the private costs borne by families with individuals who have a disability in Ireland when compared with the wider population, both in general and by severity of disability. Our modelling framework is based on the standard of living approach to estimating the cost of disability. We extend on previous research by applying panel ordered probit models to living in Ireland survey data 1995-2001 in order to control for the effects of previous disability and income and correlated unobserved heterogeneity. The approach allows us to quantify, for the first time, the additional long-run economic costs of living associated with disability. Our findings suggest that the extra economic cost of disability in Ireland is large and varies by severity of disability, with important implications for measures of poverty.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1619,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20535832/,economics
"This paper aims to explore several ways to construct a scientific and comprehensive early warning system (EWS) for local government debt risk in China. In order to achieve this goal, this paper studies the local government debt risk from multiple perspectives, i.e., individual risk, contagion risk, static risk and dynamic risk. Firstly, taking China's 30 provinces over the period of 2010~ 2018 as a sample, this paper establishes early warning indicators for individual risk of local government debt, and uses the network model to establish early warning indicators for contagion risk of local government debt. Then, this paper applies the criteria importance though intercrieria correlation (CRITIC) method and coefficient of variation method to obtain the proxy variable Ⅰ, which combines the above two risks. Secondly, based on the proxy variable Ⅰ, both the Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) model and coefficient of variation method are used to obtain the proxy variable Ⅱ, which comprehensively considers the individual risk, contagion risk, static risk and dynamic risk of local government debt. Finally, machine learning algorithms are adopted to generalize the EWS designed in this paper. The results show that: (1) From different perspectives of local government debt risk, the list of provinces that require early warning is different; (2) The support vector machines can well generalize our EWS.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263391,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35134063/,economics
"The notion that greater competition among health plans helps contain health-care costs presumes that consumers respond to economic incentives. This article tests that proposition through an examination of the factors that cause individuals to disenroll from health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The study relies upon a multivariate probit model of disenrollment behavior, estimated with data on 1,553 subscribers in three Minneapolis-St. Paul HMOs in 1984. The results indicate that disenrollments are a function largely of economic factors; disenrollments rise significantly with increases both in relative premiums and in the number of plan choices available to consumers. To illustrate, a +5.00 increase in the employee's monthly premium for one HMO, relative to the average change in the employees' premiums for all other available plans, would lead to a two thirds increase in that HMO's disenrollment rate.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-198810000-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3172866/,economics
"The fiscal multiplier represents the ratio of the change in national income to an associated increase in government spending. Fiscal multiplier effects are commonly estimated to justify options for government spending. Multiplier effects are not considered in economic evaluations of healthcare, but alternate forms of healthcare spending are expected to have varying multiplier effects. This paper describes the estimation and application of net government spending multiplier effects to two published economic evaluations. Negative net multiplier effects are estimated for an evaluated pharmaceutical for the treatment of stable cardiovascular disease, with a resulting increase in the published incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from AU$31,244 to 47,311. Positive net multiplier effects are estimated for an evaluated healthcare delivery model for frail older people, with a resulting decrease in the published incremental cost per QALY gained from AU$8129 to 7669. The inclusion of net multiplier effects in economic evaluations undertaken from a societal perspective can have important effects on the estimated value of evaluated health technologies and services. The potential for government spending on healthcare to crowd out existing spending is considered low, but further investigation of crowding-out effects is warranted.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-020-00556-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32020537/,economics
"Health care cost control is often debated in terms of markets versus bureaucracies. Market restraints are limited in practice by the goal of providing access to care. Therefore, effective cost control requires budgeting. Experience from budgeting for other services should put health care cost control in perspective: The goal should not be rational and efficient allocations, merely better ones. The important choice is not between markets and bureaucracy, but rather which decisions should be made by physicians and which by budgeters, and how to ensure that professional judgment is applied where most important.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.12.3.44,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8244245/,economics
"The authors surveyed the local health officers (LHOs) of 436 northeastern and midwestern cities about their priorities for promoting health through prevention. LHOs of the most economically stressed cities identified the following as the five most important public health prevention goals that are amenable to intervention: reducing the incidence of HIV infection and AIDS, improving maternal and infant health, controlling sexually transmitted diseases, reducing violent and abusive behavior, and immunizing against infectious diseases. Their judgments were almost identical to those of LHOs of the least economically stressed cities and of a sample of African American political and public health leaders. LHOs of the most stressed cities were more pessimistic than their counterparts about achieving the objectives. The results of this survey can be used by federal, state, and local governments as well as private organizations as a guide for allocating scarce resources.",https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2010.0185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7734632/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      School breakfast is an important nutritional component of a student's day. Many schools operate a school breakfast program, but high schools have low rates of participation. This study aimed to investigate the economic impact on school food service, of expanding the school breakfast program to increase participation in high schools.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ten rural high schools participated in the economic analysis of expanding their school breakfast program. Schools provided data on costs of daily operation and start-up costs. Analyses calculated the daily breakeven point, revenue, cost, and days needed to recoup costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Schools sold enough breakfast meals to break even on daily costs of operating an expanded program. Schools saw daily profits ranging from $196-$432 and recouped costs associated with expanding the breakfast program within 15-46 days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Expanding the school breakfast program can be economical for schools, while increasing student exposure to the health and academic benefits of school breakfast.",https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.12749,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932207/,economics
"Households obtaining health care services in developing countries incur substantial costs, despite services generally being provided free of charge by public health institutions. This constitutes an economic burden on low-income households, and contributes to deepening their level of poverty. In addition to the economic burden of obtaining health care, the method of financing these payments has implications for the distribution of household assets. This effect on resource-poor households is amplified since they have decreased access to health insurance. Recent literature, however, ignores the importance of the method of financing health care payments. This paper looks at the case of Nepal and highlights the impact on households of paying for hospital-based care of Kala-azar (KA) by analysing the catastrophic, impoverishment and economic consequences of their coping strategies. The paper utilizes micro-data on a random selection of 50% of the KA-affected households of Siraha and Saptari districts of Nepal. The empirical results suggest that direct costs of hospital-based treatment of KA are catastrophic since they consume 17% of annual household income. This expenditure causes more than 20% of KA-affected households to fall below the poverty line, with the remaining households being pushed into the category of marginal poor; the poverty gap ratio is more than 90%. Further, KA incidence can have prolonged and severe economic consequences for the household economy due to the mechanisms of informal sector financing to which households resort. A heavy burden of loan repayments can lead households on a downward spiral that eventually becomes a poverty trap. In other words, the method of financing health care payments is an important ingredient in understanding the economic burden of disease.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czn052,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19181674/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of reporting necessary information in published health economic research in World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Countries (WHO EMC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar to identify pharmacoeconomic studies conducted in WHO EMC. The inclusion criteria for the studies were: (i) original studies, (ii) compared pharmaceutical services or drugs, (iii) conducted in WHO EMC, (iv) manuscript published in English. The articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of seventeen studies were included, each of which were published in seventeen different journals. The mean CHEERS checklist score was 16 ± 4. Most studies were published in journals outside WHO EMC (n = 12; 71 percent). Cost-effectiveness (n = 5; 29 percent) and cost-utility analyses (n = 5; 29 percent) were the most frequently used methods of economic evaluation.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To suggest a scheme of decision making on pricing for medicines that are part of Free Regulated Regime, a regulation way of the pharmaceutical pricing policy in Colombia. It includes two regulation tools: international reference prices and a cost minimization analysis methodology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Following the current pricing policy, international reference prices were built with data from five countries for selected medicines, which are under Free Regulated Regime. The cost minimization analysis methodology includes selection of those medicines under Free Regulated Regime with possible comparable medicines, selection of comparable medicines, and treatment costs evaluation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      As a result of the estimate of International Reference Prices, four medicines showed in the domestic pharmaceutical market a bigger price than the Reference Price. A scheme of decision-making was design containing two possible regulation tools for medicines that are part of Free Regulated Regime: estimate of international reference prices and cost minimization analysis methodology. This diagram would be useful to assist the pricing regulation of Free Regulated Regime in Colombia.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      As present results shows, international reference prices make clear when domestic prices are higher than those of reference countries. In the current regulation of pharmaceutical prices in Colombia, the international reference price has been applied for four medicines. Would be suitable to extend this methodology to other medicines of high impact on the pharmaceutical expenditure, in particular those covered by public funding. The availability of primary sources about treatment costs in Colombia needs to be improved as a requirement to develop pharmaco-economic evidence. SISMED is an official database that represents an important primary source of medicines prices in Colombia. Nevertheless, having into account that SISMED represents an important advantage of transparency in medicines prices, it needs to be improved in quality and data availability.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839891/,economics
"Health economic studies provide information to decision makers for efficient use of available resources for maximizing health benefits. Economic evaluation is one part of health economics, and it is a tool for comparing costs and consequences of different interventions. Health technology assessment is a technique for economic evaluation that is well adapted by developed countries. The traditional classification of economic evaluation includes cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. There has been uncertainty in the conduct of such economic evaluations in India, due to some hesitancy with respect to the adoption of their guidelines. The biggest challenge in this evolutionary method is lack of understanding of methods in current use by all those involved in the provision and purchasing of health care. In some countries, different methods of economic evaluation have been adopted for decision making, most commonly to address the question of public subsidies for the purchase of medicines. There is limited evidence on the impact of health insurance on the health and economic well-being of beneficiaries in developing countries. India is currently pursuing several strategies to improve health services for its population, including investing in government-provided services as well as purchasing services from public and private providers through various schemes. Prospects for future growth and development in this field are required in India because rapid health care inflation, increasing rates of chronic conditions, aging population, and increasing technology diffusion will require greater economic efficiency into health care systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2015.11.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27881265/,economics
"Aims:
        
      
      Overactive bladder (OAB) affects up to 17% of the United States (US) population. This study aimed to synthesize estimates of direct and indirect costs of OAB in the US and compare costs among those with and without OAB.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase, from 2003 to 2016, following PRISMA guidelines. The target population was adults with idiopathic OAB or urge urinary incontinence from the US. Data were extracted on study and patient characteristics, all-cause and OAB-specific direct costs, resource use, and indirect costs. Costs were inflated to a common price year of 2016 USD.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighteen studies were included. Mean insurer paid all-cause total direct healthcare costs ranged from 8168 to 15 569 USD, and OAB-specific costs ranged from 656 to 860 USD per-patient annually. Estimates of the incremental costs for OAB patients compared to non-OAB comparators ranged from 43% to 117%. One study estimated total annual indirect costs of OAB at 11 134 USD per-patient.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The range of direct healthcare costs reported for managing patients with OAB varied, but was relatively small given the differing contributing data sources, study designs, and cost definitions. Direct costs were consistently higher among patients with OAB versus non-OAB comparisons, from a 1.4- to >2-fold increase annually. OAB-specific costs made up a small proportion of all-cause costs, highlighting the clinical and economic impact of OAB-related conditions such as falls, urinary tract infection, and depression.

"Anesthesiologists, like all other specialists, need to examine carefully their clinical practices so that excessive costs and waste can be reduced without compromising patient care or safety. While costs of drugs used for anesthesia constitute only a small fraction of total health care cost, they are highly visible costs which are easy for administrators to scrutinize. Although cost savings in an individual case may be small, the total savings may be impressive because of the large volume of cases performed. In a recent analysis of strategies to decrease PACU costs, Dexter and Tinker found that anesthesiologists have ""little control over PACU economics via the choice of anesthetic drugs"". Greater savings could be achieved by timing the arrival of patients into the PACU to reduce the peak requirement of nursing personnel. Hospital and operating room management would be better served by concentrating on these simple measures to improve efficiency rather than forcing anesthesiologists to base drug usage on acquisition costs. Even in countries that have nationalized health services, salaries make up the largest part of the costs, and the expenses in delaying an operation by 30 min exceeds the costs of a 2 h propofol infusion. It is becoming increasingly apparent that attempts at better scheduling of cases, more efficient processing of patients in the PACU to optimize admission rates, and reduced wastage of anesthetic and surgical supplies lead to greater savings than reducing anesthetic-related drug costs. Nevertheless, it is still important for anesthesiologists to participate in the ongoing effort to reduce medical costs without affecting the quality of patient care. Quality care and fiscally sound decision-making are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Simple, effective cost containment measures that all anesthesiologists can practice include using low fresh gas flow rates with inhalation agents and opening sterile packages and drug ampules only if the contents will be used. The choice of an anesthetic agent for routine use depends not only on its demonstrated efficacy and side effect profile, but also on economic factors. It is important to perform careful pharmacoeconomic evaluations of these newer drugs, including assessing all associated costs and benefits for subsets of patients undergoing different types of surgical procedures. These evaluations should also include input from patients regarding their personal preferences. Excessive emphasis on the acquisition costs of drugs may lead to blanket bans on the use of new drugs because of their higher costs rather than permitting physicians to individualize therapy according to their clinical experience and the perceived needs of a given patient. Institutional and individual variations in clinical practices, their associated costs and outcomes may alter conclusions about acceptability and economic evaluation of a particular drug or technique. The information in this review can be used to provide a rational basis for incorporating cost considerations into the decision-making process regarding the drugs, devices and techniques used in anesthesiology.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-199705000-00021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9158367/,economics
"We investigate the structure of the profit landscape obtained from the most basic, fluctuation based, trading strategy applied for the daily stock price data. The strategy is parameterized by only two variables, p and q Stocks are sold and bought if the log return is bigger than p and less than -q, respectively. Repetition of this simple strategy for a long time gives the profit defined in the underlying two-dimensional parameter space of p and q. It is revealed that the local maxima in the profit landscape are spread in the form of a fractal structure. The fractal structure implies that successful strategies are not localized to any region of the profit landscape and are neither spaced evenly throughout the profit landscape, which makes the optimization notoriously hard and hypersensitive for partial or limited information. The concrete implication of this property is demonstrated by showing that optimization of one stock for future values or other stocks renders worse profit than a strategy that ignores fluctuations, i.e., a long-term buy-and-hold strategy.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033960,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22558079/,economics

"Introduction and objectives:
        
      
      An increasing number of published studies of economic evaluations of health technologies have been reviewed and summarized with different purposes, among them to facilitate decision-making processes. These reviews have covered different aspects of economic evaluations, using a variety of methodological approaches. The aim of this study is to analyze the methodological characteristics of the reviews of economic evaluations in health care, published during the period 1990-2010, to identify their main features and the potential missing elements. This may help to develop a common procedure for elaborating these kinds of reviews.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed systematic searches in electronic databases (Scopus, Medline and PubMed) of methodological reviews published in English, period 1990-2010. We selected the articles whose main purpose was to review and assess the methodology applied in the economic evaluation studies. We classified the data according to the study objectives, period of the review, number of reviewed studies, methodological and non-methodological items assessed, medical specialty, type of disease and technology, databases used for the review and their main conclusions. We performed a descriptive statistical analysis and checked how generalizability issues were considered in the reviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 76 methodological reviews, 42 published in the period 1990-2001 and 34 during 2002-2010. The items assessed most frequently (by 70% of the reviews) were perspective, type of economic study, uncertainty and discounting. The reviews also described the type of intervention and disease, funding sources, country in which the evaluation took place, type of journal and author's characteristics. Regarding the intertemporal comparison, higher frequencies were found in the second period for two key methodological items: the source of effectiveness data and the models used in the studies. However, the generalizability issues that apparently are creating a growing interest in the economic evaluation literature did not receive as much attention in the reviews of the second period. The remaining items showed similar frequencies in both periods.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Increasingly more reviews of economic evaluation studies aim to analyze the application of methodological principles, and offer summaries of papers classified by either diseases or health technologies. These reviews are useful for finding literature trends, aims of studies and possible deficiencies in the implementation of methods of specific health interventions. As no significant methodological improvement was clearly detected in the two periods analyzed, it would be convenient to pay more attention to the methodological aspects of the reviews.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-013-0527-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23974963/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To help preserve continuity of health insurance coverage during the recent recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a 65 percent Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) premium subsidy for workers laid off in 2008-2010. We examined COBRA enrollment levels with the subsidy and the health, access, and financial consequences of enrollment decisions.
    


          Study design/data collection:
        
      
      Telephone interviews linked with health system databases for 561 respondents who were laid off in 2009 and eligible for the COBRA subsidy (80 percent response rate).
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      Overall, 38 percent reported enrolling in COBRA and 54 percent reported having some gaps in insurance coverage since being laid off. After adjustments, we found that those who had higher cost-sharing, who had higher incomes, were older, or were sicker were more likely to enroll in COBRA. COBRA enrollees less frequently reported access problems or that their health suffered because of poor access, but they reported greater financial stress due to health care spending.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Despite the substantial subsidy, a majority of eligible individuals did not enroll in COBRA, and many reported insurance coverage gaps. Nonenrollees reported more access problems and that their health worsened. Without a mandate, subsidies may need to be widely publicized and larger to encourage health insurance enrollment among individuals who suffer a negative income shock.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2012.01409.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22515835/,economics

"We previously showed that a multifaceted intervention designed to contain costs of prescribing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at a Veterans Affairs hospital resulted in substantial projected savings. Intervention components included clinician education and pharmacy and computer information process changes. We now report on effects of altering the intervention to promote prescribing of generic fluoxetine. Over 30 months, fluoxetine's market-share increased from 12 to 32% of all SSRIs prescribed. A total of $2,500,000 in cost avoidance resulted from substituting generic for brand fluoxetine, and $600,000 resulted from increases in market-share of fluoxetine. The results highlight the robustness and flexibility of the intervention approach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-006-9062-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17029000/,economics
"This article describes the components that should be included as indirect costs to be consistent with economic theory in studies conducted from a societal perspective. The recently proposed method of how to estimate indirect costs, the friction-cost approach, is shown to exclude many aspects of these indirect cost components. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this approach rests on very strong assumptions about the individual's valuation of leisure and about the labour market. This approach does not, in most realistic circumstances, have a foundation in economic theory. It also shows that all indirect costs cannot be assumed to be included in the individual's reported utility weight for a health state [used to determine quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) values], as recently suggested by the US Panel for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Health and Medicine. Therefore, to be consistent with economic theory, neither the friction-cost approach nor the QALY approach can be recommended over the more commonly used human capital-cost approach for estimating the indirect costs of a disease in economic evaluations from a societal perspective.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199813010-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10175982/,economics
"Using premium subsidies for private coverage, an individual mandate, and Medicaid expansion, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased insurance coverage. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of these provisions' effects, using the 2012-2015 American Community Survey and a triple-difference estimation strategy that exploits variation by income, geography, and time. Overall, our model explains 60% of the coverage gains in 2014-2015. We find that coverage was moderately responsive to price subsidies, with larger gains in state-based insurance exchanges than the federal exchange. The individual mandate's exemptions and penalties had little impact on coverage rates. The law increased Medicaid among individuals gaining eligibility under the ACA and among previously-eligible populations (""woodwork effect"") even in non-expansion states, with no resulting reductions in private insurance. Overall, exchange premium subsidies produced 40% of the coverage gains explained by our ACA policy measures, and Medicaid the other 60%, of which 1/2 occurred among previously-eligible individuals.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2017.02.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28319791/,economics
"The need is urgent to bring US health care costs into a sustainable range for both public and private payers. Commonly, programs to contain costs use cuts, such as reductions in payment levels, benefit structures, and eligibility. A less harmful strategy would reduce waste, not value-added care. The opportunity is immense. In just 6 categories of waste--overtreatment, failures of care coordination, failures in execution of care processes, administrative complexity, pricing failures, and fraud and abuse--the sum of the lowest available estimates exceeds 20% of total health care expenditures. The actual total may be far greater. The savings potentially achievable from systematic, comprehensive, and cooperative pursuit of even a fractional reduction in waste are far higher than from more direct and blunter cuts in care and coverage. The potential economic dislocations, however, are severe and require mitigation through careful transition strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2012.362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22419800/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To assess the quality of pharmacoeconomic evaluations (PEs) submitted with new drug applications for reimbursement and to investigate the role of PEs for coverage decisions in Korea.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty-seven PEs that were submitted by pharmaceutical companies for coverage decisions between June 2005 and December 2009 were included in this study. To assess their appropriateness with regard to the PE guidelines, we used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment services (HIRA) checklist consisting of 20 items based on the PE guidelines. We also evaluated the results for coverage decisions, as ""recommended,"" ""recommended with restricted use,"" or ""not recommended,"" based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the range of uncertainty.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On average, 14 of the 20 items on the HIRA checklist were fulfilled (70.9%, range 35.0%-100%). The compliance rate for the following items was above 70%: presentation of perspectives and evaluation methods, a sufficient time horizon, and appropriateness of comparators and health outcomes. The compliance rate for the following items was below 70%: omission of objectives for the study, inappropriate target population, unclear selection process for effectiveness and cost, inappropriate cost estimation, insufficient justification of generalizability, and description of study limitations. The range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-years of PEs from a societal perspective varied from dominant to 59K USD (n = 13): it consisted of dominant to 28K USD for ""recommended"" submissions (n = 6), 8K to 20K USD for ""recommended with restricted use"" submissions (n = 4), and 13K to 59K for ""not recommended"" ones (n = 3).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study showed that most PEs in this study have reached an adequate level for coverage decisions. Overall barriers associated with a lack of relevant evidence could account for the low compliance rate with specific items in the PE guidelines.

"Objectives:
        
      
      Considering rising health expenditure on the one hand and increasing public expectations on the other hand, there is a need for explicit health care rationing to secure public acceptance of coverage decisions of health interventions. The National Health Security Office, the institute managing the Universal Coverage Scheme in Thailand, recently called for more rational, transparent, and fair decisions on the public reimbursement of health interventions. This article describes the application of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to guide the coverage decisions on including health interventions in the Universal Coverage Scheme health benefit package in the period 2009-2010.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We described the MCDA priority-setting process through participatory observation and evaluated the rational, transparency, and fairness of the priority-setting process against the accountability for reasonableness framework.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The MCDA was applied in four steps: 1) 17 interventions were nominated for assessment; 2) nine interventions were selected for further quantitative assessment on the basis of the following criteria: size of population affected by disease, severity of disease, effectiveness of health intervention, variation in practice, economic impact on household expenditure, and equity and social implications; 3) these interventions were then assessed in terms of cost-effectiveness and budget impact; and 4) decision makers qualitatively appraised, deliberated, and reached consensus on which interventions should be adopted in the package.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This project was carried out in a real-world context and has considerably contributed to the rational, transparent, and fair priority-setting process through the application of MCDA. Although the present project has applied MCDA in the Thai context, MCDA is adaptable to other settings.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22999148/,economics
"Policy analysts sometimes imagine that problems in the individual market can be fixed by waving a magic wand that makes the individual market function more like the group market. However, prior studies reveal that purchasing cooperatives fail to achieve substantial economies of scale; market reforms that reduce the impact of medical underwriting are difficult to implement in the individual market; and it may not be as easy as imagined to induce people to purchase over the Internet or from new or smaller companies that are at higher risk for exiting the market. The best solution is to limit the use of subsidies to certain purchasing options, such as with purchasing cooperatives that abide by rating, issuance, and renewability rules. What is not acceptable is to hand people subsidies and send them to the unstructured and relatively unregulated individual market, nor will it work to give people unhindered choice between two basically different market segments.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w2.353,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12703591/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The burden from non-communicable diseases and injuries (NCDI) in India is increasing rapidly. With low public sector investment in the health sector generally, and a high financial burden on households for treatment, it is important that economic evidence is used to set priorities in the context of NCDI.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our objective was to understand the extent to which economic analysis has been used in India to (1) analyze the impact of NCDI and (2) evaluate prevention and treatment interventions. Specifically, this analysis focused on the type of economic analysis used, disease categories, funding patterns, authorship, and author characteristics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic review based on economic keywords to identify studies on NCDI in India published in English between January 2006 and November 2016. In all, 96 studies were included in the review. The analysis used descriptive statistics, including frequencies and percentages.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A majority of the studies were economic impact studies, followed by economic evaluation studies, especially cost-effectiveness analysis. In the costing/partial economic evaluation category, most were cost-description and cost-analysis studies. Under the economic impact/economic burden category, most studies investigated out-of-pocket spending. The studies were mostly on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neoplasms. Slightly over half of the studies were funded, with funding coming mainly from outside of India. Half of the studies were led by domestic authors. In most of the studies, the lead author was a clinician or a public health professional; however, most of the economist-led studies were by authors from outside India.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results indicate the lack of engagement of economists generally and health economists in particular in research on NCDI in India. Demand from health policy makers for evidence-based decision making appears to be lacking, which in turn solidifies the divergence between economics and health policy, and highlights the need to prioritize scarce resources based on evidence regarding what works. Capacity building in health economics needs focus, and the government's support in this is recommended.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-018-0370-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29611047/,economics
"Surgeons have, over the past 7 years, experienced a significant decrease in valuation of their services. This has been accomplished by use of the Resource-Based Relative Value System, and its interpretation and modification by various agencies of the federal government. Congress recently mandated a study of practice costs that could result in further reductions of up to 30%. In anticipation of this further reduction, it is important to understand in as accurate a way as possible what has happened thus far to the value for surgical services. Simple percentage in decrease of fees is well understood, but their decrease in relation to the cost of a constant market basket of goods has not been well publicized. We present a simple method for determining the change in value for any procedure or service done by a surgeon in relation to the cost of a constant market basket of goods for any period of time from 1970 to 1995. For example, the increase in the cost for the constant market basket of goods between 1972 and 1992 is shown to be 236%. The increase in value for a typical cardiothoracic procedure in the same time period was 52%. The valuation for this procedure has actually declined 55% from 1972 to 1992, relative to the market basket of goods. The service that would buy the complete basket in 1972 will now buy only 45% of the basket.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-4975(95)00666-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7574955/,economics
"There is a paucity of studies on the economics of smoking cessation. Those undertaken have investigated only a narrow range of available interventions, using variable methodologies which make interstudy comparisons problematical. There is a need for more economic appraisal in this area and for greater consistency in the methodologies employed. Growing evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacotherapies has not been matched by evidence of their cost effectiveness, and studies in this area, particularly on transdermal nicotine, are urgently required. Cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) have focused on programmes targeted at pregnant women and indicate that resource savings, mainly from reductions in the number of low birthweight neonates, can exceed the costs of the measures. Efforts to persuade pregnant women to quit thus appear to be highly cost beneficial, but further evidence on the efficiency of measures targeted at other groups or to the general population of smokers is required. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) suggest that measures targeted at specific groups are more cost effective than those targeted at the general population of smokers, and that the cost effectiveness of such programmes is further improved by providing educational materials that are specific to the targeted groups. Advice on how to maintain abstinence appears to improve the cost effectiveness of help with quitting, and routine advice from physicians to their smoking patients is a cost-effective way of reducing smoking prevalence.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199304050-00004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10146872/,economics

In this article I examine different decision and policy situations where economic evaluations of drug treatments could potentially be used. Economic evaluations may be used as an aid to the development of treatment guidelines, decisions within healthcare organisations, and decisions relating to approval, reimbursement and pricing. Economic evaluations appear to be most useful in the development of treatment guidelines and as an aid to reimbursement decisions. The incentive to use economic evaluations embodied in the healthcare system is also important. It is argued that it is too early to introduce regulations that require the use economic evaluations in, for example, reimbursement decisions. A more cautious approach might be preferred, where economic evaluations are used more selectively until the methodology and the field have developed further.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199508030-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10172485/,economics
"Rapid economic growth has always entailed serious disruption: environmental, ideological, and political. As a result the relationship between economic growth and public health is complex since such disruption always threatens to spill over into deprivation, disease and death. The populations of most current high-income, high-life expectancy countries of 'the West' endured several decades of severely compromised health when they first experienced industrialization in the last century Although health technologies have moved on, the social, administrative and political disruption accompanying economic growth can still impede the delivery of health improvements. The case history of 19th-century laissez-faire Britain is explored in some detail to demonstrate the importance of these social and political forces, particularly the relative vigour and participatory nature of local government, linking to recent work on the importance of social capital in development. For a country like China today, paradoxically, there is nothing that needs such careful planning as a 'free market' economy.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3156.1999.00369.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206269/,economics
"Pharmacoeconomic analyses employ a wide range of techniques and methods to help societies allocate scarce health-care resources wisely, fairly, and efficiently. Techniques such as dynamic optimization and optimal control, however, have yet to be exploited by this field. Although control theory has a long history in mathematical biology and disease management, its application to economic costs in these disciplines has not yet been explored. Pharmacoeconomics therefore may offer a particularly promising starting point because of the emphasis this field places on the economic perspective. Although challenges may exist to implementing these techniques in practice (at least in some settings), there will nevertheless be value to considering the dynamic perspective these techniques offer, which requires thinking more critically about the optimal allocation of scare health-care resources over time. Therefore, our article serves as a primer to introduce this dynamic perspective from an economic standpoint within the context of two examples of treating of hyperlipidemia.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2006.00088.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16626414/,economics
"The steadily increasing number of dialysis patients prompts considerations on possibilities for budget reductions with maintenance of treatment quality. A literature survey is presented concerning trends of population increase, individual treatment costs, rationing of patient intake, and consequences of delayed progress of renal insufficiency as well as of savings during both the initial and the later phases of regular dialysis therapy. Cost reduction in one area may well induce rising total budgets and influence clinical outcome. A multidisciplinary approach is suggested to obtain answers to several questions: Can the economic burden of the changing patient demography be counterbalanced by a reorganized staff structure? Will early referral, good predialysis control, and incremental dialysis start imply longer survival? Will increased dialysis doses be economically neutralized by less staff requirements, drug consumption, and patient morbidity? Should dialyzer reuse be abandoned?

"There is increasing pressure for medical care reimbursement to be linked to outcomes. New medications approved for glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and dry eye disease may offer improved outcomes, but they have higher acquisition costs. This article reviews published pharmacoeconomic studies assessing the incremental change in outcomes achieved vs. the increased medication costs incurred. The different types of pharmacoeconomic evaluations are described. Identified pharmacoeconimic evaluations range from simple cost-consequence statements to more complex cost-utility analyses conducted across many healthcare systems. Notably missing in all analyses are the effects of improved treatment on patient productivity. Although the diversity and small number of studies limit conclusions, there is some evidence that the newer glaucoma medications, as a group, produce economic offsets such as reduced glaucoma surgeries and fewer physician visits. Photodynamic therapy for AMD may be cost-effective when used early in patients with better visual acuity allowing cost-offsets over longer periods of time to be considered. The single pharmacoeconomic analysis of topical cyclosporine for dry eye disease was only hypothesis-generating.

Given the current context of global economic hardship and difficult budgetary decisions, the report offered timely recommendations for achieving universal health coverage (UHC). This article analyses the current methods of healthcare financing in Ireland and their implications for UHC. Three questions are asked of the Irish healthcare system: firstly, how is the health system financed; secondly, how can the health system protect people from the financial consequences of ill-health and paying for health services; and finally, how can the health system encourage the optimum use of available resources? By answering these three questions, this article argues that the Irish healthcare system is not achieving UHC, and that it is unclear whether recent changes to financing are moving Ireland closer or further away from the WHO's ambition for healthcare for all.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.07.022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23992755/,economics
"The escalating expenditure on patients with HIV/AIDS within an inadequately funded public health system is tending towards crowding out care for patients with non-HIV illnesses. Priority-setting decisions are thus required and should increasingly be based on an explicit, transparent and accountable process to facilitate sustainability. South Africa's public health system is eroding, even though the government has received extensive donor financing for specific conditions, such as HIV/AIDS. The South African government's 2007 HIV plan anticipated costs exceeding 20% of the annual health budget with a strong focus on treatment interventions, while the recently announced 2012-2016 National Strategic HIV plan could cost up to US$16 billion. Conversely, the total non-HIV health budget has remained static in recent years, effectively reducing the supply of health care for other diseases. While the South African government cannot meet all demands for health care simultaneously, health funders should attempt to allocate health resources in a fair, efficient, transparent and accountable manner, in order to ensure that publicly funded health care is delivered in a reasonable and non-discriminatory fashion. We recommend a process for resource allocation that includes ethical, economic, legal and policy considerations. This process, adapted for use by South Africa's policy-makers, could bring health, political, economic and ethical gains, whilst allaying a social crisis as mounting treatment commitments generated by HIV have the potential to overwhelm the health system.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2013.790461,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23651436/,economics
"We demonstrate by mathematical analysis and systematic computer simulations that redistribution can lead to sustainable growth in a society. In accordance with economic models of risky human capital, we assume that dynamics of human capital is modeled as a multiplicative stochastic process which, in the long run, leads to the destruction of individual human capital. When agents are linked by fully redistributive taxation the situation might turn to individual growth in the long run. We consider that a government collects a proportion of income and reduces it by a fraction as costs for administration (efficiency losses). The remaining public good is equally redistributed to all agents. Sustainable growth is induced by redistribution despite the losses from the random growth process and despite administrative costs. Growth results from a portfolio effect. The findings are verified for three different tax schemes: proportional tax, taking proportionally more from the rich, and proportionally more from the poor. We discuss which of these tax schemes performs better with respect to maximize growth under a fixed rate of administrative costs, and the governmental income. This leads us to general conclusions about governmental decisions, the relation to public good games with free riding, and the function of taxation in a risk-taking society.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054904,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23390505/,economics

"Cost-of-illness (COI) was the first economic evaluation technique used in the health field. The principal aim was to measure the economic burden of illness to society. Its usefulness as a decision-making tool has however been questioned since its inception. The main criticism came from welfare economists who rejected COIs because they were not grounded in welfare economics theory. Other attacks related to the use of the human capital approach (HCA) to evaluate morbidity and mortality costs since it was said that the HCA had nothing to do with the value people attach to their lives. Finally, objections were made that COI could not be of any help to decision makers and that other forms of economic evaluation (e.g. cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit analysis) would be much more useful to those taking decisions and ranking priorities. Conversely, it is here suggested that COI can be a good economic tool to inform decision makers if it is considered from another perspective. COI is a descriptive study that can provide information to support the political process as well as the management functions at different levels of the healthcare organisations. To do that, the design of the study must be innovative, capable of measuring the true cost to society; to estimate the main cost components and their incidence over total costs; to envisage the different subjects who bear the costs; to identify the actual clinical management of illness; and to explain cost variability. In order to reach these goals, COI need to be designed as observational bottom-up studies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.07.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139925/,economics

"Aim:
        
      
      This study was designed to analyse the drug consumption difference and economic impact of an antibiotic sequential therapy focused on quinolones.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We studied the consumption of quinolones (ofloxacin/levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) 6 months before and after the implementation of a sequential therapy program in hospitalised patients. It was calculated for each antibiotic, in its oral and intravenous forms, in defined daily dose (DDD/100 stays per day) and economical terms (drug acquisition cost). At the beginning of the program ofloxacin was replaced by levofloxacin and, since their clinical uses are similar, the consumption of both drugs was compared during the period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In economic terms, the consumption of intravenous quinolones decreased 60% whereas the consumption of oral quinolones increased 66%. In DDD/100 stays per day, intravenous forms consumption decreased 53% and oral forms consumption increased 36%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Focusing on quinolones, the implementation of a sequential therapy program based on promoting an early switch from intravenous to oral regimen has proved its capacity to alter the utilisation profile of these antibiotics.

Recently, a range of organizations have been advocating forms of analysis that have been termed ""value frameworks."" There has also been a push for analytical methods to reflect a fuller range of benefits of interventions through multicriteria decision analysis. A key principle that is invariably neglected in current and proposed frameworks is the need to reflect evidence on the opportunity costs that health systems face when making funding decisions. The mechanisms by which opportunity costs are realized vary depending on the system's financial arrangements, but they always mean that a decision to fund a specific intervention for a particular patient group has the potential to impose costs on others in terms of forgone benefits. These opportunity costs are rarely explicitly reflected in analysis to support decisions, but recent developments to quantify benefits forgone make more appropriate analyses feasible. Opportunity costs also need to be reflected in decisions if a broader range of attributes of benefit is considered, and opportunity costs are a key consideration in determining the appropriate level of total expenditure in a system. The principles by which opportunity costs can be reflected in analysis are illustrated in this article by using the example of the proposed methods for value-based pricing in the United Kingdom.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.11.021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28237201/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this paper was to determine whether there is evidence that periodontitis prevention is economically justified.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The characteristics of economic assessments such as cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were first derived from the literature on health economy. A literature search was conducted using PubMed up to December 2004. Inclusion criteria required that economic analyses be based on scientific principles including a hypothesis, valid comparative groups as well as a cost/benefit, cost/effectiveness and cost/utility assessment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Only 14 papers were located, which included, in the broadest sense, economic parameters. From these papers, three were systematic reviews, three were randomized controlled studies, four were controlled studies, one was a longitudinal cohort study and three papers were based on statistical modelling. Only one paper reported actual costs for periodontal and dental treatment. Extensive programmes aimed at prevention of periodontal disease in a general population group showed no economic benefit. Adjunctive genetic/and or microbiological testing likewise showed no economic benefit. Economic assessments and real costs are not generally available in the literature. Statistical modelling suggested that non-surgical periodontal procedures are more economical compared with surgical interventions. The use of local delivery devices as an adjunct to Sc/RP showed no economic advantage.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It is suggested that economic parameters as well as patient-centred outcomes be included in clinical trials. These data are essential for the appropriate allocation of resources for preventive measures on an individual patient and population base.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-051x.2005.00802.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16128845/,economics
"Concern about the economic aspect of cancer care is increasing. However, economic evaluations for cancer care are deficient in a number of areas, despite recent important contributions. To generate better evidence for economic evaluation of care for patients with cancer and intractable disease, the recent trends and problems with economic evaluations in these areas in Japan are examined. Several examples of economic evaluations, such as those concerned with bone marrow transplantation for leukemias, breast-conserving treatment for early breast cancer, and antiemetic treatment for patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, showed substantial possibilities for evaluating value for money in health care with a view to establishing an effective and efficient health care system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s005200050205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9833298/,economics
"We studied the role of economic incentives for private providers in explaining Spain's disproportionately large number of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripters (ESWLs) and low number of linear accelerators (linacs) per million population (pmp) in comparison to other countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We found that the reimbursement policy for 1990 allowed an average profit per private ESWL of $732,000, but no profit for linacs. Regional per-capita income was positively correlated with ESWLs pmp in Spain (R2 = 0.49; p = .001), but not with linacs. Sixty-nine percent of ESWLs were privately held versus only 16% of linacs. To avoid these types of distortions, financial incentives should be based on a reasonable relationship between cost and charges and should be associated with the appropriateness of medical care.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462300011016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9136480/,economics
"Why have patterns of healthcare spending varied during the Great Recession? Using cross-national, harmonised data for 27 EU countries from 1995 to 2011, we evaluated political, economic, and health system determinants of recent changes to healthcare expenditure. Data from EuroStat, the IMF, and World Bank (2013 editions) were evaluated using multivariate random- and fixed-effects models, correcting for pre-existing time-trends. Reductions in government health expenditure were not significantly associated with magnitude of economic recessions (annual change in GDP, p=0.31, or cumulative decline, p=0.40 or debt crises (measured by public debt as a percentage of GDP, p=0.38 or per capita, p=0.83)). Nor did ideology of governing parties have an effect. In contrast, each $100 reduction in tax revenue was associated with a $2.72 drop in health spending (95% CI: $1.03-4.41). IMF borrowers were significantly more likely to reduce healthcare budgets than non-IMF borrowers (OR=3.88, 95% CI: 1.95 -7.74), even after correcting for potential confounding by indication. Exposure to lending from international financial institutions, tax revenue falls, and decisions to implement cuts correlate more closely than underlying economic conditions or orientation of political parties with healthcare expenditure change in EU member states.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.11.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315493/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      We estimated state-level disability-associated health-care expenditures (DAHE) for the U.S. adult population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a two-part model to estimate DAHE for the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian adult population using data from the 2002-2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and state-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Administrative data for people in institutions were added to generate estimates for the total adult noninstitutionalized population. Individual-level data on total health-care expenditures along with demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and payer characteristics were used in the models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The DAHE for all U.S. adults totaled $397.8 billion in 2006, with state expenditures ranging from $598 million in Wyoming to $40.1 billion in New York. Of the national total, the DAHE were $118.9 billion for the Medicare population, $161.1 billion for Medicaid recipients, and $117.8 billion for the privately insured and uninsured populations. For the total U.S. adult population, 26.7% of health-care expenditures were associated with disability, with proportions by state ranging from 16.9% in Hawaii to 32.8% in New York. This proportion varied greatly by payer, with 38.1% for Medicare expenditures, 68.7% for Medicaid expenditures, and 12.5% for nonpublic health-care expenditures associated with disability.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      DAHE vary greatly by state and are borne largely by the public sector, and particularly by Medicaid. Policy makers need to consider initiatives that will help reduce the prevalence of disabilities and disability-related health disparities, as well as improve the lives of people with disabilities.",https://doi.org/10.1177/003335491012500107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20402195/,economics
"The private nonprofit hospital is the dominant organizational form in the U.S. hospital industry. Various reasons have been advanced for its high market share. As hospitals undergo massive changes due in large part to changes in payment practices, there is widespread concern that nonprofit hospitals may become less committed to noncommercial activities. This may even be more likely when such hospitals convert to for-profit status. The empirical evidence indicates that, on average, hospitals of nonprofit and for-profit ownership are similar in the provision of uncompensated care, the quality of care, and the adoption of technology. Conversion of a nonprofit to for-profit status does not adversely affect the provision of uncompensated care on average. However, for-profits are more likely to be located in areas where consumers have the ability to pay for care. As hospital markets become more competitive and the opportunity for cross-subsidizing more unprofitable, collective-good activities will become increasingly difficult. Support for such activities, if they are to exist, will have to come from explicit public subsidies.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2<234::aid-pam7>3.0.co;2-i,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10182439/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the costs and potential financial benefits of integrated care models for patients with chronic diseases, that is, type 2 diabetes mellitus, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis, respectively.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search of the literature was performed using EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Studies that conducted a cost analysis, considered at least two components of the chronic care model, and compared integrated care with standard care were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of 575 articles, 26 were included. Most studies examined integrated care models for type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 18) and to a lesser extent for schizophrenia (n = 6) and multiple sclerosis (n = 2). Across the three disease groups, the incremental cost per patient per year ranged from - €3860 to + €613.91 (x¯ = - €533.61 ± €902.96). The incremental cost for type 2 diabetes mellitus ranged from - €1507.49 to + €299.20 (x¯ = - €518.22 ± + €604.75), for schizophrenia from - €3860 to + €613.91 (x¯ = - €677.21 ± + €1624.35), and for multiple sclerosis from - €822 to + €339.43 (x¯ = - €241.29 ± + €821.26). Most of the studies (22 of 26 [84.6%]) reported a positive economic impact of integrated care models: for type 2 diabetes mellitus (16 of 18 [88.9%]), schizophrenia (4 of 6 [66.7%]), and multiple sclerosis (1 of 2 [50%]).

"Owing to increasing healthcare costs, there is a need to examine whether the benefits of new technologies are worth the extra cost. In proton therapy, where the evidence in favor is limited, it is heavily debated whether the expected benefit justifies the higher capital and operating costs. The aim of this article was to explore the existing methodologies of economic evaluations (EEs) of particle therapy and recommend an approach for future data collection and analysis. We reviewed the published literature on health economics of proton therapy using accepted guidelines on performing EE. Different cost strategies were assessed and comparisons with other treatment modalities were made in terms of cost-effectiveness. Potential bias in the existing studies was identified and new methodologies proposed. The principal cause of bias in EEs of proton therapy is the lack of valid data on effects as well as costs. The introduction of proton therapy may be seriously hampered by the lack of outcome and cost data and the situation is likely to continue not only in terms of justifying the capital investment but also covering the operational costs. We identified an urgent need to collect appropriate data to allow for reimbursement of such novel technology. In the absence of level 1 evidence, well-performed modeling studies taking into account the available cost and outcome parameters, including the current uncertainties, can help to address the problem of limited outcome and health economic data. The approach of coverage with evidence development, in which evidence is collected in an ongoing manner in population-based registries along with dedicated financing, may allow technological advances with limited initial evidence of benefit and value, such as protons, to become available to patients in an early phase of their technology life cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semradonc.2012.11.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23473691/,economics

"As the demand for publicly funded health care continues to rise in the U.S., there is increasing pressure on state governments to ensure patient access through adjustments in provider compensation policies. This paper longitudinally examines the fees that states paid physicians for services covered by the Medicaid program over the period 1998-2004. Controlling for an extensive set of economic and health care industry characteristics, the elasticity of states' Medicaid fees, with respect to Medicare fees, is estimated to be in the range of 0.2-0.7 depending on the type of physician service examined. The findings indicate a significant degree of price competition between the Medicaid and Medicare programs for physician services that is more pronounced for cardiology and critical care, but not hospital care. The results also suggest several policy levers that work to either increase patient access or reduce total program costs through changes in fees.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-014-9146-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24682916/,economics
"Rare diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in high income countries and have major repercussions on individuals and health care systems. This chapter examines the health economy of rare diseases from two different perspectives: firstly, the study of the economic impact of rare diseases (Cost of Illness studies); and, secondly, cost-effectiveness evaluation, which evaluates both the costs and results of the health care technologies applied in rare diseases. From the point of view of economics, health resource allocation is based on the principle of scarcity, as there are not - and never will be- sufficient resources for all worthy objectives. Hence, policy makers should balance costs and health outcomes. Rare diseases may well represent a significant societal burden that should rightly receive appropriate prioritisation of health care resources. As new and seemingly expensive health care technologies are developed for rare diseases, it will become increasingly important to evaluate potential and real impact of these new technologies in both dimensions: social costs and health outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9485-8_16,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20824451/,economics
"In many countries, local managers and clinicians have been given responsibility to set health priorities and allocate resources accordingly. Although tools have been suggested for use in aiding this process, knowledge of these tools within health regions is lacking and comparative analysis in the literature is limited. Several approaches to priority setting are critiqued from both practical and theoretical perspectives, and a tangible way forward for such activity is provided. The approaches analysed include: needs assessment, core services, economic evaluation including quality-adjusted life year league tables, and programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA). Needs assessment fails to recognize underlying economic principles of opportunity cost and the margin, while core services ignores the margin and has had limited impact in practice. Economic evaluations can consider marginal costs and benefits, but cannot always be used to inform decisions in a timely manner. PBMA is based on underlying economic principles and can pragmatically respond to objectives related to both efficiency and equity. Although PBMA is not without challenges, from an economic perspective, it does seem to ""get the thinking right"", and, importantly, as a process, can incorporate some of the other approaches to priority setting discussed in this paper.",https://doi.org/10.1258/095148403321591410,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12803949/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      To examine the household economic consequences that are associated with out-of-pocket spending for the care and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire was posted to all patients enrolled (n = 656) in the Respiratory Ambulatory Care Service in western Sydney, Australia, between 1 January 2001 and 31 August 2008. Two hundred and eighteen completed questionnaires were received.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and sixty-nine (78%) respondents experienced economic hardship while managing their illness. Fifty-nine (27%) reported being unable to pay for medical or dental expenses, 38 (18%) were unable to pay for medication, 59 (27%) were unable to pay rent or mortgage and 40 (19%) were unable to pay utility bills. Respondents experiencing economic hardship paid more out-of-pocket overall (=AUD$544 versus =AUD$280; t(148) = -2.03, P = 0.04) and for medications and oxygen specifically (=AUD$247 versus =AUD$125; t(83) = -3.98, P < 0.0001). Fifty-six (46%) respondents had catastrophic levels of out-of-pocket spending which made them 7.5 times more likely to experience economic hardship (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-46.3).

"This is the first attempt to explore linkages among industrialization, urbanization, energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and economic growth based on estimations in simultaneous equations framework. An economic growth model is extended to incorporate industrialization as shift factor and pollutant emissions as determinant of total factor productivity.

"This study examines how the volume of privately insured services provided in hospital inpatient and outpatient departments changes in response to reductions in Medicare physician payments. We hypothesize that physicians consider relative payment rates when choosing which patients to treat in their practices. When Medicare reduces its payments for surgical procedures, as it did in the late 1980s, physicians are predicted to treat more privately insured patients because they become more lucrative. We use data from 182 hospitals for seventeen major procedures groups, covering a forty-five-month period between 1988 and 1991 that encom passes a twenty-four-month period before the reduction in Medicare fees and twenty-one months after the reduction. Our findings are consistent with the predictions for a number of procedure groups, but not for all of them. One implication of the findings is that societal savings from Medicare fee reductions are overstated if one does not also consider spillover effects in the private insurance market.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-24-6-1307,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10626694/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To measure the impact of invasive aspergillosis infection on US hospital costs and financial performance across different patient populations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Hospital discharge data for patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of aspergillosis were extracted from the 2003 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the fiscal year 2003 (FYO3) Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file. The data on patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), hospital charges, estimated costs, and reimbursement levels were reported. After controlling for comorbidities, operative procedures, and diagnosis-related group (DRG) assignment, the clinical and economic outcomes were compared for patients with and without aspergillosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The NIS contains a total of over 38 million projected hospital discharges. From these, 10400 aspergillosis cases were identified across 171 DRGs, resulting in a US incidence rate of 36 per million per year. The mean age of aspergillosis patients was 55.6 years, with 53.4% male and 67.9% Caucasian. The median (mean) LOS per aspergillosis patient was 10 (17.7) days, with a median (mean) total hospital charge (THC) of $44,845 ($96,731). Among the patient subgroups analyzed, the median (mean) THC per patient ranged from $47,252 ($82,946) for HIV to $413,200 ($442,233) for bone marrow transplant (BMT). When compared to the non-aspergillosis patient population, the data showed a significant increase in LOS, THC, and hospital costs. Furthermore, the higher hospital costs associated with aspergillosis patients were not matched by similar increases in reimbursements, resulting in a greater financial loss for hospitals. The mean reimbursement-to-cost ratio for aspergillosis cases across the DRGs analyzed was 0.80.
    


          Conclusions:

"This is the second article in a 2-part series that examines the economic impact of several different strategies used to control costs in third party programmes. This article investigates 5 different methods: (a) formularies; (b) capitation; (c) drug utilisation review; (d) prior approval; and (e) drug product selection. The published literature indicates that use of formularies decreases drug expenditures, but these savings may be offset by expenditures in other areas of healthcare programmes. Capitation, though less well studied than other strategies, may show some effectiveness in reducing costs by increasing generic dispensing and promoting switching from prescription drug to over-the-counter. Drug utilisation review, as a systematic programme of claims data review, has been shown to yield positive economic return in a variety of areas, including both impersonal and face-to-face educational interventions with healthcare practitioners. Prior approval and drug product selection both result in savings when examined in isolation from other aspects of healthcare.

We use variation in the industry and union status of covered workers within a county over time to identify the causal effects of generosity. Although OLS estimates fail to reject the hypothesis that generosity facilitates the exercise of hospital market power, IV estimates show a statistically significant and economically important positive effect of plan generosity on hospital prices in uncompetitive markets, but not in competitive markets.

"In the Dutch health care system, health insurers negotiate with hospitals about the pricing of hospital products in a managed competition framework. In this paper, we study these contract prices that became for the first time publicly available in 2016. The data show substantive price variation between hospitals for the same products, and within a hospital for the same product across insurers. About 27% of the contract prices for a hospital product are at least 20% higher or lower than the average contract price in the market. For about half of the products, the highest and the lowest contract prices across hospitals differ by a factor of three or more. Moreover, hospital product prices do not follow a consistent ranking across hospitals, suggesting substantial cross-subsidization between hospital products. Potential explanations for the large and seemingly random price variation are: (i) different cost pricing methods used by hospitals, (ii) uncertainty due to frequent changes in the hospital payment system, (iii) price adjustments related to negotiated lumpsum payments and (iv) differences in hospital and insurer market power. Several policy options are discussed to reduce variation and increase transparency of hospital prices.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133119000215,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30973119/,economics

"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The United States has the highest healthcare costs among developed countries. This review evaluates surgical practices and equipment choices during endoscopic hysterectomy, highlighting opportunities for the gynecologic surgeon to reduce costs and maximize surgical efficiency.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      There are opportunities to economize at every step of the endoscopic hysterectomy. When surgeons are provided education about instrumentation costs, the cost of hysterectomy has been shown to decrease. Colpotomy has been found to be the rate-limiting step in laparoscopic hysterectomy; use of a uterine manipulator likely saves time and money. When evaluating the economic impact of route of surgery, the cost differential between laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hysterectomy has decreased. Robotic-assisted hysterectomy may be more cost-effective in some cases, such as for larger uteri. From a systems-level perspective, dedicating a specific operating room team to the gynecology service can decrease operative time.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The gynecologic surgeon is best equipped to control surgery-related costs by making choices that improve surgical efficiency and decrease operating room time. If a costlier piece of equipment leads to a more efficient case, the choice may be more cost-effective. There are multiple systems-level changes that can be implemented to decrease surgery-related costs.",https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000636,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32371608/,economics
"Economic crisis drives many governments into drastic spending cuts in order to minimize their healthcare costs, resulting in an increase of out-of-pocket payment. This causes mainly the most vulnerable social groups, not only in poor countries, to lose their access to quality care and their ability to pay, and leads them in to catastrophic healthcare expenditures. Questions about whether health spending can be catastrophic rise across nations where there is an income reduction, unemployment and serious or chronic illness. Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death today. The first cost-of-illness study, which estimated the costs of cardiovascular disease in the EU in 2003, found them to be €169 billion a year, while the most recent, in 2009, estimated them at nearly €196 billion a year. Financial protection measures must be taken by governments in order to protect their citizens, particularly the most vulnerable ones.",https://doi.org/10.1586/14737167.2014.859526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24308449/,economics
"Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) will affect the external business environment of economic entities, which in turn affects the decision-making of economic entities. Meanwhile, carbon emissions are closely related to the production decisions of microeconomic entities. Thus, studying the relationship between EPU and carbon emissions helps to clarify the impact of institutional factors behind carbon emissions, which is significant for achieving green development. Based on US sector data, we apply a novel parametric test of Granger causality in quantiles to analyze the relationship between EPU and carbon emissions (its growth and uncertainty). We find that there is an outstanding pattern of Granger-causality from the US EPU to the growth of carbon emissions in the tails of the growth distributions of carbon emissions in the industrial sector, residential sector, electric power sector, and transportation sector, except in the commercial sector. That is, carbon emissions are affected by EPU when the growth of carbon emissions is in a higher or lower growth period. Lastly, we find that the US EPU affects carbon emissions uncertainty over the entire conditional distribution for all sectors.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05627-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230232/,economics
"For almost 2 decades, the European nations have witnessed a continuous cycle of healthcare reform policies. Although each of these efforts to craft new public policy has been tailored to fit the specific political, social and cultural circumstances of each country, there are many striking similarities among these attempts to reduce costs while preserving the quality and equity of healthcare. Everywhere, market-oriented healthcare proposals and policies have been introduced. But everywhere these have gone hand in hand with plainly anticompetitive mechanisms, which have brought the command-and-control structure of Europe's healthcare systems under even greater government control. Market mechanisms were introduced only as a means to limit costs, and not with the goal to empower patients. The goal has been to limit the economic growth of the healthcare sector by restricting consumption.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200018001-00011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11151314/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      The first aim of this workshop was to define pharmacoeconomic concepts and terminology. Pharmacoeconomics can be defined as the branch of economics that uses cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, cost-minimization, cost-of-illness and cost-utility analyses to compare pharmaceutical products and treatment strategies. Economic evaluations provide healthcare decision-makers with valuable information, allowing optimal allocation of limited resources. However, pharmacoeconomics is based on long-term benefits, whereas physicians are typically forced to seek immediate savings. The second aim was to review pharmacoeconomic studies in the field of onychomycosis and finally to discuss future perspectives.
    


          Results and conclusions:
        
      
      We discussed current pharmacoeconomic issues on the management of onychomycosis. Consensus was reached on the following issues: * Published pharmacoeconomic studies concerning onychomycosis are flawed. Future studies should be based on internationally validated principles and appropriate models. The fact that costs of different drugs, laboratory examinations and physician visits vary worldwide should be considered. Cost-benefit studies are required. * The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations are often considered in countries other than the UK, even when not adapted to the country in question. * Generic drugs might reduce costs, but this depends on their effectiveness (bioavailability). * Sampling requests affect the economic cost (dependent on methodology, which depends on country) and physicians often trust their instincts even when tests are repeatedly negative. * The cost of adverse event management is usually considered to be 10%; this may be too high for onychomycosis, as treatments are relatively safe without severe side-effects. * Probability of recurrence for each drug should be determined. * Need for disease severity standardization, definition of diagnostic criteria and successful treatment (mycological and clinical cure).",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-3083.2005.01285.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16120204/,economics
"Recent interpretations of citizenship are firmly rooted in the value of social membership and social participation. Citizens are described as having a moral right to draw upon the support of the community, but at the same time have a responsibility to contribute to the provision of social services such as health care. In contrast, contemporary health economics has been criticised for taking a narrow and individualistic view of human behaviour. This paper examines the extent to which economic theory and practice have been developed to accommodate a more 'civic' view, namely, the notions of mutual concern for community members, social participation and social rights. It is argued that because the provision of health care is often linked to feelings of compassion and social responsibility and not just to individual well-being, this sort of insight may enrich economic analysis and, in turn, provide a way around health economics' reputed 'dead end'.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02678117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10181502/,economics
"This review is intended for scientists who may be curious about ""laws"" of economics. Here, I search for laws governing value, including the value of money (inflation). I begin by searching out early scientists, e.g., Aristotle, Copernicus, and Galileo, who contributed to theories of value, or who, like Isaac Newton and J. Willard Gibbs, inspired students of political economy and thereby profoundly influenced the evolution of economic thinking. From a period ranging from Aristotle to John Stuart Mill in the mid-nineteenth century, I extract two candidates for ""laws"" of economics, one the well-known ""law of supply and demand"" (LSD) and the other, less well-known, ""Fisher's equation of exchange"" (FEE). LSD, in one form or another, has been central to the development of economic thought, but it has proven impossible to express LSD in any compact, deterministic form with causal implications. I propose, however, that, as suggested by Irving Fisher early in the twentieth century and 100 years later by Nobelist Thomas Schelling, FEE is analogous to the first law of thermodynamics (FLT). I argue that both FEE and FLT can be viewed as ""accounting identities,"" pertaining to energies in the case of FLT and money in the case of FEE. Both, however, suffer from a similar limitation: neither provides any information concerning causal relations among the relevant variables. I reflect upon the impact of the absence of firm, fact-based, economic laws with causal implications on modern economic policy, allowing it to be dominated by ideologies damaging to American society.",https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00324.2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33237798/,economics
"Federal, state, and local government agencies require current and accurate cost information for publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs to guide program assessments and reimbursement decisions. The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment published a list of modality-specific cost bands for this purpose in 2002. However, the upper and lower values in these ranges are so wide that they offer little practical guidance for funding agencies. Thus, the dual purpose of this investigation was to assemble the most current and comprehensive set of economic cost estimates from the readily available literature and then use these estimates to develop updated modality-specific cost bands for more reasonable reimbursement policies.

"Economic theory asserts that to achieve maximum conservation benefits land acquisition needs to be cost effective.

For this case study, optimization yields additional conservation benefits worth an estimated 3.1-3.9 million US dollars or achieves the same level of conservation benefits but at a cost savings ranging from 0.9 to 3.5 million US dollars, depending on the initial budget size.

"Objective:
        
      
      While it is generally accepted that the decision to switch a drug from the prescription market to the over-the-counter (OTC) market is based on an optimization problem that firms are solving, no attempts have been made to formalize the problem. The purpose of this article is to present a model of prescription to OTC switching that helps explain the role of potential generic competition in a firm's decision to switch. In particular, we examine what market conditions are necessary for the threat of generic competition to induce switching.
    


          Design and setting:
        
      
      The model is game-theoretic, played between an incumbent firm and a potential generic entrant, and is solved for its subgame perfect equilibrium. The incumbent first decides whether to apply to the FDA to switch to the OTC market. If the incumbent declines, then the potential generic entrant has the opportunity to apply for the switch. The FDA then accepts or rejects the application, and the generic chooses whether to enter the market.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In equilibrium, when applying to switch is costless, switching occurs if the probability that the application will be approved by the FDA is strictly positive and the OTC market is characterized by first-mover advantages. Adding a cost to the application process places restrictions on the probability of FDA approval to offset the cost of applying. The probability of approval must be sufficiently high to offset the cost of the application.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The model shows that switching from the prescription to OTC market may occur as a response to potential generic competition. Firms switch because they know that if they do not, a generic may initiate a switch and become the first mover in the OTC market.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199916060-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10724793/,economics
"Health spending growth through 2013 is expected to remain slow because of the sluggish economic recovery, continued increases in cost-sharing requirements for the privately insured, and slow growth for public programs. These factors lead to projected growth rates of near 4 percent through 2013. However, improving economic conditions, combined with the coverage expansions in the Affordable Care Act and the aging of the population, drive faster projected growth in health spending in 2014 and beyond. Expected growth for 2014 is 6.1 percent, with an average projected growth of 6.2 percent per year thereafter. Over the 2012-22 period, national health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.8 percent.

"Unfavorable economic conditions in most of Africa (in this paper Africa refers to Sub-Saharan Africa only) have meant public austerity and a deceleration in government health spending. Given the dominant role of government in providing health services in Africa there is a need to investigate the links between public spending and the provision of health care. Analyzing information from five Sub-Saharan African countries, namely Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Senegal, we investigate the impacts of shifting expenditure patterns and levels on the process of providing health services as well as on delivery of health care. The country analyses indicate that in addition to the level of public spending, the expenditure mix (i.e. salaries, drugs, supplies etc.), the composition of the health infrastructure (hospitals, clinics, health posts etc.), community efforts, and the availability of private health care all influence health care delivery. Consequently, per capita public expenditure (the most important indicator in a number of related studies) alone as a measure of the availability of health care and especially for cross-country comparisons is inadequate. Reductions in government resources for health care often result in less efficient mixing of resources and hence less health care delivery, in quality and quantity terms. With the recent trends in health care spending in Africa there should be greater effort to increase the efficient use of these increasingly scarce resources, yet the trend in resource mix has been in the opposite direction. Given the input to public health care of local communities, as well as the provision of private health care, it would seem that government spending on health care should be counter-cyclical, i.e. government health spending should accelerate during periods of economic down turns. Such counter-cyclical spending would tend to offset the difficulties facing local communities and the declining ability of individuals to pay for private health care. Recommending counter-cyclical health spending may seem wishful, but it points up the necessity of understanding what is likely to happen to health care in African countries in the face of economic difficulties, and particularly in the face of fiscal austerity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(92)90189-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1574729/,economics

"Israel's experience in attempting to implement a health system reform based in large measure on managed competition should provide important data to other countries considering reliance on competitive mechanisms for third-party purchase of health care. In this paper, current proposals for reform of the Israeli market for third-party purchase of health care are examined in light of ideal market structures, particularly the theory of managed competition. The relationship between the theory, the notion of a 'purchaser-provider split' and the Israeli case are explored. The current Israeli health care market, which features enrollment of 96% of the population in competing sick funds, is presented. The changes necessary to base third-party purchase of health-care on managed competition are discussed. Special conditions of the Israeli health care system likely to influence implementation of a managed competition strategy are considered. Beyond a 'purchaser-provider' split, the proposals call for other restructurings, such as a split between finance and insurance functions, which the standard theory of managed competition does not take into account. The implications of these proposals for smooth functioning of the health care market must be weighed against political and ethical considerations unique to the Israeli environment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)90239-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7863357/,economics

"In this study, aggregate-level panel data from 20 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries over three decades (1980-2009) were used to investigate the impact of hospital payment reforms on healthcare output and mortality. Hospital payment schemes were classified as fixed-budget (i.e. not directly based on activities), fee-for-service (FFS) or patient-based payment (PBP) schemes. The data were analysed using a difference-in-difference model that allows for a structural change in outcomes due to payment reform. The results suggest that FFS schemes increase the growth rate of healthcare output, whereas PBP schemes positively affect life expectancy at age 65 years.

"The purpose of the study is to reduce the error in the pricing process of financial derivatives, as well as to obtain more accurate product values, thereby reducing transaction costs, accelerating transaction speed, establishing a larger investment scale, and enabling investors to obtain excellent returns under market conditions as much as possible. Based on the variance reduction technology, a Monte Carlo model that can effectively analyze financial prices is added to analyze price fluctuations and find the optimal holding time for users of financial derivatives, thereby reducing the risk of holding the financial derivatives. The results show that the Monte Carlo model-based variance reduction technology can significantly improve the simulation efficiency of financial derivatives pricing. In addition, the importance sampling method is used to optimize the selection, thereby making it closer to the theoretical values. The proposed method is easy to implement and has higher computational efficiency, which can ensure the financial benefits of users holding financial derivatives during the holding period. It can be seen that the Monte Carlo model-based variance reduction technology has high application value in the pricing of financial derivatives, and it is of great significance for the pricing of other products.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229737,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32108828/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the pharmacoeconomic benefits of treating depression and compare the available therapies by reviewing the current literature on economic analyses of depression.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      A MEDLINE search (January 1966-June 1998) of English-language literature relating to economic analyses of depression was conducted. Key search terms included depression, antidepressant, economics, pharmacoeconomics, outcomes, and costs. Additional literature was collected from reference lists of articles found through the MEDLINE search.
    


          Study selection and data extraction:
        
      
      A MEDLINE search was performed using the above key words. Search and evaluation were limited to pharmacoeconomic evaluations of major depressive disorder. All available studies were considered for inclusion in the review.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      The advent of newer, brand-name antidepressants as well as increased concern regarding healthcare costs has raised interest in the costs associated with treating depression. Although the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other newer antidepressants have higher acquisition costs, both modeling and naturalistic studies have shown that the total cost of treating depression is no higher with SSRIs than with the tricyclic antidepressants. These differences are primarily due to increased patient adherence with the newer agents and lower costs secondary to physician visits, laboratory monitoring, and hospitalization.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The economic aspects of treating depression are becoming more frequently evaluated as newer antidepressant medications become available and as healthcare entities attempt to address increasing costs. In general, most pharmacoeconomic research on depression has been conducted on one of the SSRIs in comparison with various tricyclic antidepressants. These studies frequently use simulation techniques and rely heavily on data from clinical trials. Few studies have compared the newer antidepressants, and no clear evidence exists that any one of these agents is more cost-effective than others. Even fewer studies have addressed the pharmacoeconomics of medication management of depression in various healthcare environments (e.g., public mental health care vs. private psychiatry vs. primary care).",https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.17379,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10200863/,economics

"In current literature, displaced services have been suggested to provide a basis for determining a threshold value for the effects of a new technology as part of a reimbursement process when budgets are fixed. We critically examine the conditions under which displaced services would represent an economically meaningful threshold value. We first show that if we assume that the least cost-effective services are displaced to finance a new technology, then the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the displaced services (d) only coincides with that related to the opportunity cost of adopting that new technology, the ICER of the most cost-effective service in expansion (n), under highly restrictive conditions-namely, complete allocative efficiency in existing provision of health care interventions. More generally, reimbursement of new technology with a fixed budget comprises two actions; adoption and financing through displacement and the effect of reimbursement is the net effect of these two actions. In order for the reimbursement process to be a pathway to allocative efficiency within a fixed budget, the net effect of the strategy of reimbursement is compared with the most cost-effective alternative strategy for reimbursement: optimal reallocation, the health gain maximizing expansion of existing services financed by the health loss minimizing contraction. The shadow price of the health effects of a new technology, βc = (1/n + 1/d - 1/m)(-1), accounts for both imperfect displacement (the ICER of the displaced service, d < m, the ICER of the least cost-effective of the existing services in contraction) and the allocative inefficiency (n < m) characteristic of health systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0140-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24515251/,economics

"In a two-stage survey, a cross-section of Australians were questioned about the importance of costs in setting priorities in health care. Generally, respondents felt that it is unfair to discriminate against patients who happen to have a high cost illness and that costs should therefore not be a major factor in prioritising. The majority maintained this view even when confronted with its implications in terms of the total number of people who could be treated and their own chance of receiving treatment if they fall ill. Their position cannot be discarded as irrational, as it is consistent with a defensible view of utility. However, the results suggest that the concern with allocative efficiency, as usually envisaged by the economists, is not shared by the general public and that the cost-effectiveness approach to assigning priorities in health care may be imposing an excessively simple value system upon resource allocation decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(95)00751-d,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10153484/,economics
"This study aimed to examine the association between the payer mix and the financial performance of public and private hospitals in Lebanon. The sample comprised 24 hospitals, representing the variety of hospital characteristics in Lebanon. The distribution of the payer mix revealed that the main sources of revenue were public sources (61.1%), out-of-pocket (18.4%) and private insurance (18.2%). Increases in the percentage of revenue from public sources were associated with lower total costs and revenues, but not profit margins. An inverse association was noted between increased revenue from private insurance and profitability, attributed to increased costs. Increased percentage of out of- pocket payments was associated with lower costs and higher profitability. The study provides evidence that payer mix is associated with hospital costs, revenues and profitability. This should initiate/inform discussions between public and private payers and hospitals about the level of payment and its association with hospital sector financial viability.",https://doi.org/10.26719/2015.21.6.381,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26369996/,economics
"Although heart failure disease management (HFDM) programs improve patient outcomes, the implementation of these programs has been limited because of financial barriers. We undertook the present study to understand the economic incentives and disincentives for adoption of disease management strategies from the perspectives of a physician (group), a hospital, an integrated health system, and a third-party payer. Using the combined results of a group of randomized controlled trials and a set of financial assumptions from a single academic medical center, a financial model was developed to compute the expected costs before and after the implementation of a HFDM program by 3 provider types (physicians, hospitals, and health systems), as well as the costs incurred from a payer perspective. The base-case model showed that implementation of HFDM results in a net financial loss to all potential providers of HFDM. Implementation of HFDM as described in our base-case analysis would create a net loss of US dollars 179,549 in the first year for a physician practice, US dollars 464,132 for an integrated health system, and US dollars 652,643 in the first year for a hospital. Third-party payers would be able to save US dollars 713,661 annually for the care of 350 patients with heart failure in a HFDM program. In conclusion, although HFDM programs may provide patients with improved clinical outcomes and decreased hospitalizations that save third-party payers money, limited financial incentives are currently in place for healthcare providers and hospitals to initiate these programs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2006.08.019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17223429/,economics

"Of the 72 clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) installations operating in the United States in 1985, operations data were obtained from 47. The average annual technical operating cost of each unit is estimated at $841,500 when performing 2000 clinical procedures. Most costs are fixed and the annual cost varies slightly, between $800,000 and $882,000, with procedure volumes of 1000-3000 annually. The ""typical"" clinical MRI unit currently is examining 1500 patients and billing 1260 patients annually with a mean technical charge of $500. Of the procedures, 77% are neuroradiologic (head and spine). Radiologists are responsible for 93% of MRI procedures. The partial-pay/bad-debt revenue deduction is high (40%). With annual technical costs of about $820,000 and net technical revenues of $378,000, the typical unit is operating at an annual economic loss of about $440,000. An economic break-even point would be met with a charge of $1100 at the current procedure volume or a volume of 2700 procedures/year at the current charge. MRI units in outpatient locations study more patients, perform considerably more spinal examinations, and have higher charges. Compared with computed tomography at a comparable stage of development, MRI has less clinical demand, more outpatient locations, three to five times higher costs, and two-and-one-half times higher charges. To achieve economic viability with a technical charge of $500 or less, increased patient volume and third-party payer acceptance to reduce the partial-pay/bad-debt revenue factor will be required.",https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.145.2.393,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3875241/,economics
"The pressure on glaucoma services is ever-growing, and policymakers seek robust cost-effectiveness arguments in their decisions around resource allocation. The benefits of glaucoma are in preventing or delaying a future loss of vision and associated quality of life, and this expectation is quantified using a metric called utility which can be compared against other disease states. In recent clinical trials lasting up to 3 years, it has been difficult to show a difference in utility between glaucoma treatments in this limited period of time. When it comes to cost, the direct medical costs are only part of the broad range of costs that glaucoma brings to patients and communities, and the estimation of these costs can be difficult and imprecise. While the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma care, in general, is not in dispute, especially over longer time frames, the inability to measure changes in utility in shorter time frames impedes the uptake of innovations around the world. A number of approaches to improve the sensitivity and specificity of utility measurements are under investigation.",https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001462,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32053550/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to provide quantitative information on the economic, social and emotional burden borne by families of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and on the public healthcare costs of a child with ADHD in Flanders, Belgium, and to compare costs of ADHD children with those of siblings without the disorder.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A pilot-tested questionnaire was sent to all members of the Flemish ADHD society in February 2003. Parents were asked to record utilisation of healthcare, social care and other non-medical resources for their ADHD child and his/her sibling. In addition, data were collected on ADHD severity (IOWA-Conners Rating Scale) and on the sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the parents. Parents' out-of-pocket and public annual costs were calculated using tariffs. These costs were corrected for several confounding variables using general linear model (GLM) estimates.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ADHD affects school results and parents' productivity and places a psychological and emotional burden on the family. Childhood ADHD also results in a significantly higher use of healthcare: ADHD children have a significantly higher probability of visiting a general practitioner (60.3% vs 37.4%) and a specialist (50.9% vs 12.9%); they also visit the emergency department significantly more often (26% vs 12.1%), and they are hospitalised significantly more often (14% vs 8.4%). Consequently, Flemish children with ADHD incur significantly higher medical costs than their siblings without the disorder. Even after correction for several covariates, these cost differences are still striking. In fact, compared with their sibling, the annual cost for an ADHD child is more than six times higher for the parent (Euro 588.3 vs Euro 91.5), and public costs are twice as high (Euro 779 vs Euro 371.3) [year of costing 2002].

"This article reviews some of the salient features of the Belgian health care finance and delivery system. Special attention is paid to the role played by the third-party payers, i.e. the Health Insurance Associations (HIAs) in administering the compulsory national health insurance program. It is shown how, despite extensive government regulation, the markets for GP, specialist and hospital services exhibit fierce competition of the non-price variety. Next, the paper considers the three problems perceived to be the most pressing ones at present: (i) the problem of raising sufficient revenues to cover the public share of health expenditures; (ii) the (related) cost containment problem; and (iii) the problem of ensuring efficiency through appropriate incentive mechanisms. Finally, two recently proposed options for reform are discussed and complemented with a third proposal based on the ideas of regulated competition. It is concluded that strengthening the role of the third-party payers remains crucial in any attempt to reshape the system to make it efficient and affordable while keeping it equitable.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)90242-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7863360/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      The aims of the study are to make an inventory of fixtures of aseptic compounding structures, to compare, using real examples, the design and operating costs of controlled atmosphere area (CAA) with isolators and CAA with laminar flow biological safety cabinets (BSCs) in order to determine the most economical scheme in hospitals and to give a final facilities cost calculated for one workstation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty-three hospitals were interviewed (21 French and 22 from four European countries) over seven months. Hospital pharmacists completed a form with 390 items. Hospitals are compared according to their workstation type: BSCII or BSCIII (group B) and isolator (group I), using Mann and Whitney's statistical test and Monte-Carlo modeling.
    


          Results:

"That ""more competition in healthcare primarily produces more needs-based equity, better quality, higher efficiency, reduced costs and less bureaucracy"" is a familiar claim. But is it correct? Three types of competition can be identified within a triangle: (1) competition among third-party-payers for insured individuals/customers, (2) competition among providers for patients, and (3) competition among third-party payers for contracts with providers--and vice versa. German and international evidence for these three types of competition demonstrates that many expectations--e.g., that patients can be steered based on quality information--are wishful thinking. Instead of market and competition, regulation is needed (e.g., in the form of an effective risk-based allocation mechanism) to ensure high-quality care for those 5% of the population incurring 50% of the healthcare expenditures (i.e., the seriously ill patients), while at the same time competition based on selective contracts does not pay off for the majority of the population due to high transaction costs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2009.10.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20120187/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The economic implications of inpatient adverse events and rising healthcare costs have intensified interest in patient safety and the efficient delivery of products and services with cost-saving potential. New technologies may help in this regard but must be evaluated economically as well as clinically and should demonstrate cost-benefit for consideration by payers and providers. One such technology--an automated early-alert system for patient distress--has been developed. Performance data suggest clinical worthiness and warrant economic evaluation of the system.
    


          Scope:
        
      
      A hospital-perspective analysis was conducted with cost modeling and retrospective data to estimate the economic consequences of deleterious clinical events and the impact of the early-alert system when deployed during routine medical-surgical admissions. The principal outcome was expected per-patient direct costs associated with inpatients falls and cardiopulmonary arrests. Reduction of these clinical events through intelligent surveillance with the early-alert system suggested economic benefits that may offset the cost of the technology.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The expected per-patient direct cost for inpatient falls and cardiopulmonary arrests was 191.73 dollars per hospitalization. Estimated economic benefits associated with early-alert surveillance supported a break-even cost of 14.59 dollars per day for the system.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study estimated the impact of the early-alert system on the deleterious clinical and economic consequences of inpatient falls and cardiopulmonary arrests on the medical-surgical ward as well as a break-even cost for the system. Results are limited by retrospective data and cost modeling. Ongoing clinical evaluation is required to quantify and compare more precisely the cost of care with and without the system in real-life clinical settings. In the interim, this study may provide some insight into the components and magnitude of the cost for the cited events and the potential benefits and detriments that offset or contribute to the cost of the early-alert system.

It is well known that Sen's capability approach and preference utilitarianism have different distributional values. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how Sen's capability approach might be operationalised for allocation decisions and cost-effectiveness analysis in health care. The paper identifies several requirements for measuring health or well-being in line with the capability approach. Among them is the need for objective assessments of capabilities. This paper also shows that from the perspective of the capability approach a portion of productivity changes are irrelevant for allocation decisions.,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1355421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24165915/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      This article explores key principles of comparative effectiveness analysis--in particular, how radiologic comparative and cost-effectiveness studies differ from other clinical trials. Exemplary studies are reviewed to show how comparative effectiveness has been implemented in radiology and how future studies might be conducted.

      Comparative effectiveness is likely to require a paradigm shift in thinking within the discipline. For new radiologic applications to be accepted, we will need to show at least a significant change in treatment planning and at best a meaningful change in patient outcomes.

"Objective:
        
      
      Theory and guidelines advocating the inclusion of informal care in economic evaluation have, in recent years, been accompanied by developments in the methods for capturing the costs and outcomes related to informal care. The objective of this study was to review applied economic evaluations to identify the methods used for, and implications of, including informal care in practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Searches of key databases were conducted to identify all full economic evaluations incorporating costs or outcomes relating to informal care. Information was extracted by using a standard template from all studies meeting the inclusion criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty economic evaluations were identified that included informal care. Twenty-five of these studies costed carers' time input and 17 measured outcomes for carers. The reported cost-effectiveness of interventions was altered by including informal care, in some cases changing the key conclusions for health care funding.

"Health is one of the fundamental human rights. Recognizing it as a right means that the State has an obligation to ensure a minimum level of opportunities is maintained, and to restore it when lost. This minimum level may not be covered in periods of economic crisis, such as the one we are currently experiencing.Managed care, focused on economic questions, emerged after the crisis of 1973 in order to help make clinical decisions based on economic factors. In practice, the result of managed care was to turn economic cost control into an end in itself while forgetting about equity; something for which it has been challenged from an ethical perspective. Since then, many authors have attempted to reconcile efficiency and equity in health management, but the debate remains open.In this article, and basing our approach on the theories of P. Ruger and Norman Daniels, we argue that shared health governance and accountability for reasonableness can offer significant ethical contributions in the process of achieving an efficient and fair health system. In the model we propose, citizens, professionals and health institutions all play an active role in capacity building in the field of health. These capacities are related to healthy lifestyles, accessible and transparent information, the promotion of self-care, the acquisition of knowledge, skills and appropriate attitudes, leadership based on values and co-responsibility to achieve set goals in a reasonable way.

"Global travel and tourism have enjoyed a significant boost due to the progress in air transport. However, the debate on air transport and the influx of foreign investments and global energy demand on economic development remains questionable. Therefore, this study is an attempt to contribute to the body of knowledge in the energy-tourism-led growth hypothesis literature. For this purpose, a novel approach to the effects of international tourism on economic growth is introduced for the Next-5 largest economies, namely (China, India, Indonesia, Turkey and the USA) between 1990 and 2018. Empirical results reveal a positive connection between foreign direct investment and income levels, electricity production and income levels, as well as between urbanization and economic growth. Moreover, the validation of the environmental Kuznets curve and the halo effect of foreign direct investment on the environmental degradation process provides a shred of more substantial evidence and fitting environmental instruments for policymakers. The empirical results encourage sustainable economic growth in these countries, mainly through the attraction of clean and high-technology foreign investment, the increase of the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix and the regulation in the tourism industry.

"A variety of different key performance indicators, both for process and financial performance, are used to evaluate OR efficiency. Certain indicators like OR utilization and turnover times seem to become common standard in many hospitals to evaluate OR process performance. Despite the general use and availability of these indicators in OR management, the scientific evidence behind these data is relatively low. These process indicators are strongly influenced by artefacts and depend on planning process, resource allocation and documentation. Direct financial indicators become more important with increasing autonomy of OR management. Besides budgetary compliance the focus is set on the net results of internal transfer pricing systems. By taking part in an internal transfer pricing system, OR management develops from a mere passive cost center to an active shaper of perioperative processes. However, detailed knowledge of the origin of costs and pitfalls of internal transfer pricing systems is crucial. The increased transparency due to the free accessibility of diagnosis-related-groups (DRG) cost breakdown data can help to develop tools for economic analysis of OR efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-006-1126-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17333035/,economics

We empirically document the presence of these shifts for a broad list of medical conditions and assess the implications for price indexes. Following the earlier literature, we compare the growth of two price measures: one that tracks expenditures for the services actually provided to treat conditions and another that holds the mix of those services fixed over time. Using retrospective claims data for a sample of commercially insured patients, we find that, on average, expenditures to treat diseases rose 11% from 2003Q1 to 2005Q4 and would have risen even faster, 18%, had the mix of services remained fixed at the 2003Q1 levels.

Furthermore, we build a disease-level index that links a disease to the average level of GDP per capita of the countries in which the disease is prevalent. With this index, we highlight the link between economic development and the complexity of diseases and illustrate how increases in income per capita are associated with more complex diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244843,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33411767/,economics

Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses in this area face challenges presented by estimation of costs of environmental interventions, whose costs are likely to decrease with further technological innovation. Benefits are also more difficult to quantify economically and can only be partially alleviated through willingness-to-pay approaches. Nevertheless, economic analyses in children's environmental health are highly informative and important informants to public-health and policy practice. Further attention and training in their appropriate use are needed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/msj.20234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21259266/,economics
"In this study we explore whether HMO-induced competition has contained expenditures in Minneapolis/St. Paul hospitals. Specifically, we assessed the impact of HMOs on revenue, cost, and net income per admission in Twin Cities hospitals from 1979 to 1981. Some HMOs have obtained negotiated discounts from hospitals. We found that hospitals which gave larger discounts did not have lower costs per admission. This finding suggest that discounts do not force hospitals to operate more efficiently. In addition, hospitals with a large share of patients from HMOs or government Medicare and Medicaid programs did not have lower costs per admission than other hospitals during the years from 1979 to 1981. This finding casts doubt on the claim that discounts are justified by lower costs for HMO or government patients. Finally, neither HMO market share nor discounts had an adverse effect on hospital profits. During the three years studied, hospital profits in the Twin Cities showed an upward trend. This study concludes that if competition is to succeed it must encompass more than HMOs. HMOs may be important, but they are only one agent in the market. Thus, public policy created to induce competition must go beyond the simple stimulus of HMO growth.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-10-4-675,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3517126/,economics
"As an extension of a contribution by Health Policy and Law to Public Health Education in areas of mutual concern, a descriptive model of cost containment policy in health care delivery is developed. The model starts from the basis of a typology of key Congressional enactments promoting economically motivated policymaking in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These policies and laws are, in turn, related to the resulting multilevel adaptive behavior in health care services delivery and acquisition. From this descriptive model the thesis is developed that although government has improved its effectiveness in attaining economic and budgetary goals, this type of policy is also creating displacements and generally leading to the retrenchment of national commitment to equity-promoting social welfare policy and the possibility of abandoning longstanding historical commitments on strictly economic and budgetary grounds. The article concludes by placing emphasis on the need for public health disciplines to collaborate in order to strengthen national policy, to create a new health policy synthesis, and to strengthen the ability of individuals to qualitatively improve their situation and more effectively assert their health and social welfare rights.",https://doi.org/10.1177/109019818601300302,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3531095/,economics
"Preventive health care services are increasingly considered important, not only for their lifesaving aspects but for their cost-effectiveness, which many assume would prevail in a competitive health care market. This view was supported by empirical evidence until the mid-1990s, but since then the nature of competition among health plans and the utilization of preventive care have constantly been changing. Research has yet to provide a clear answer on how these changes are affecting competition and, in turn, how competition among health plans affects the utilization of preventive care. These primary research questions are addressed in this study through the use of insurance claims data in a multilevel model, not previously used in the study of preventive care. The results of multilevel logistic regression show that the greater the number of insured people enrolled in HMOs, the greater is the likelihood of receiving mammograms and Pap smears. However, if HMOs as a group are increasingly exercising their market power, given the degree of competition among them, the likelihood of receiving both types of preventive care in the market is reduced.",https://doi.org/10.2190/hs.41.2.f,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21563625/,economics
"The International Monetary Fund's response to evidence on the impact of its programs on public health fails to address the fundamental criticisms about its policies. The IMF's demand for borrowers to achieve extremely low inflation targets is founded on very little empirical evidence in the peer-reviewed literature. The low-inflation policies privilege international creditors over domestic debtors and short-term priorities over long-term development goals, and contain high social costs, referred to by economists as a ""sacrifice ratio."" For example, governments' raising of interest rates to bring down inflation undermines the ability of domestic firms to expand production and employment and thus ""sacrifices"" higher economic growth and higher tax revenues and unnecessarily constrains domestic health spending. During financial crisis, most countries seek to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, the opposite of the IMF's general advice. Perversely, compliance with IMF policies has become a prerequisite for receiving donor aid. Critiques of the IMF express significant concerns that IMF fiscal and monetary policies are unduly restrictive. Health advocates must weigh in on such matters and pressure their finance ministries, particularly in the G7, to take steps at the level of the IMF Executive Board to revisit and modify its policy framework on deficits and inflation. Such reforms are crucial to enable countries to generate more domestic resources while the global health community searches for ways to support strengthening health system capacity.",https://doi.org/10.2190/hs.40.2.n,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20440977/,economics
"Health economic evaluations are comparative analyses of alternative courses of action in terms of their costs and consequences. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement, published in 2013, was created to ensure health economic evaluations are identifiable, interpretable, and useful for decision making. It was intended as guidance to help authors report accurately which health interventions were being compared and in what context, how the evaluation was undertaken, what the findings were, and other details that may aid readers and reviewers in interpretation and use of the study. The new CHEERS 2022 statement replaces the previous CHEERS reporting guidance. It reflects the need for guidance that can be more easily applied to all types of health economic evaluation, new methods and developments in the field, and the increased role of stakeholder involvement including patients and the public. It is also broadly applicable to any form of intervention intended to improve the health of individuals or the population, whether simple or complex, and without regard to context (such as healthcare, public health, education, and social care). This Explanation and Elaboration Report presents the new CHEERS 2022 28-item checklist with recommendations and explanation and examples for each item. The CHEERS 2022 statement is primarily intended for researchers reporting economic evaluations for peer-reviewed journals and the peer reviewers and editors assessing them for publication. Nevertheless, we anticipate familiarity with reporting requirements will be useful for analysts when planning studies. It may also be useful for health technology assessment bodies seeking guidance on reporting, given that there is an increasing emphasis on transparency in decision making.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.10.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35031088/,economics
"Psychotherapy, especially the intensive variety, has been put under considerable adverse pressure by changes in the economics of medicine and psychiatry. The dominance of third-party rather than out-of-pocket payment for services raises questions about the ""medicality,"" and thus the eligibility for coverage, of some disorders treated with psychotherapy. Trends toward the ""industrialization"" of psychiatry threaten to curtail the independent, fee-for-service conditions that may be necessary for psychotherapeutic practice.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the methodological quality of Italian health economic evaluations and their generalizability or transferability to different settings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was performed on the PubMed search engine to identify trial-based, nonexperimental prospective studies or model-based full economic evaluations carried out in Italy from 1995 to 2013. The studies were randomly assigned to four reviewers who applied a detailed checklist to assess the generalizability and quality of reporting. The review process followed a three-step blinded procedure. The reviewers who carried out the data extraction were blind as to the name of the author(s) of each study. Second, after the first review, articles were reassigned through a second blind randomization to a second reviewer. Finally, any disagreement between the first two reviewers was solved by a senior researcher.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred fifty-one economic evaluations eventually met the inclusion criteria. Over time, we observed an increasing transparency in methods and a greater generalizability of results, along with a wider and more representative sample in trials and a larger adoption of transition-Markov models. However, often context-specific economic evaluations are carried out and not enough effort is made to ensure the transferability of their results to other contexts. In recent studies, cost-effectiveness analyses and the use of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were preferred.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite a quite positive temporal trend, generalizability of results still appears as an unsolved question, even if some indication of improvement within Italian studies has been observed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2015.03.1795,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26297100/,economics
"The United States relies on competition to balance costs and quality in the health care system. But concentration is increasing throughout the hospital, physician, and insurer markets. Midsize community hospitals face declining demand and growing competition from both larger hospitals and smaller freestanding diagnostic and surgical centers, leaving the midsize hospitals vulnerable to closure or merger with other facilities. Competition among insurers has been limited by the development of hospital systems that extend the bargaining power of ""must-have"" hospitals (those perceived to provide the best care for complex and less common conditions) across local health care markets. Government antitrust enforcement could play an important role in maintaining competition in both the hospital and insurer markets, but in many markets, the impact of that enforcement has been limited to date. Policy makers should consider supplementing antitrust activities with strategies that combine competition and regulation-for example, by regulating selected prices and structuring competition to cover entire insurance markets.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0555,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28874483/,economics
"Recently, China is named among the most carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting countries in the world after the United State of America (USA). A major part of Chinese carbon dioxide emissions is as a result of offshore industrial activities which come into the economy as foreign direct investment (FDI). Following this, the present study seeks to investigate the nexus between CO2 emissions, FDI, energy use, and tourism arrivals, and possibly to advise on who will bear the responsibility of offshore CO2 emissions. Utilizing ARDL-bound testing and Granger causality approaches for both short- and long-run effects the author found that economic growth (GDP) has a positive relationship with both tourism arrivals, energy use, FDI, and CO2.This contributes to heavy CO2 emissions which the author classified as the outsourced/offshore CO2emissions in China's FDI. Tourism arrivals have a bi-directional (feedback) causal relationship with energy use and a uni-directional causal relationship with CO2(transmitting from tourism to CO2). Both FDI and energy use have a bi-directional (feedback) causal relationship; CO2, energy use, and tourism arrivals have a unidirectional relationship with GDP which established the triangular nexus causality among the variables and the impact on GDP. Hence, the policy implication should be geared towards implementing the policies and regulations that will checkmate and reduce the excesses of foreign firms to the environment quality of China and promote environmentally friendly economic activities.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05542-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31240648/,economics
"Adverse events arising from health-care management, rather than a disease process, may place as great a burden on society as all other forms of injury put together. By analysing data from the Quality in Australian Health Care Study (a retrospective review of 14 179 medical records representative of admissions to Australian acute care hospitals in 1992), and applying costing techniques based on Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) cost weights, it is possible to compare the economic impacts of different kinds of adverse events. This can assist in determining priorities for interventions. However, due to limitations inherent in DRG cost weights, there is a need to employ further techniques to refine the costing base of adverse events so that it more closely reflects their resource use.

"The principles, methods, and applications of pharmacoeconomics and pharmaceutical outcomes evaluations are discussed. Pharmacoeconomics may be defined as balancing the cost with the consequences (outcomes) of pharmaceutical therapies and services. As a type of outcomes evaluation, pharmacoeconomics looks beyond just the direct or acquisition cost of a pharmaceutical by including its impact on total health resource utilization and costs. Outcomes research attempts to answer the question, What difference does the pharmaceutical make in patient outcomes under real-world conditions? The economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes (ECHO) model for a pharmacoeconomic evaluation views the drug as some combination of its clinical, economic, and humanistic attributes. Safety and effectiveness are no longer the only salient attributes of a drug; the effect on total health resource utilization, cost, and quality of life must also be evaluated. The four types of pharmacoeconomic methods are cost-minimization analysis, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and cost-utility analysis. As disease state management continues to emerge as a cost-management, quality assurance strategy, formularies per se will wane in importance and pharmacoeconomic and outcomes data will increase in relevance as health professionals endeavor to find the most efficient and effective combinations of medical care. Pharmacoeconomics as a component of outcomes research will help pharmacists decide which clinical circumstances, patient characteristics, and practice settings are most suitable for particular interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/52.19_suppl_4.s5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8846244/,economics
"The expenditures for hospital drugs are continuously increasing, and grow much faster than the global hospital budgets do. This explosive growth is caused mainly by a few so-called 'expensive drugs' of which the oncolytics form the main part. The global budgets should stimulate more effective provision of care ('technical efficiency'), however the room for technical efficiency is decreasing. Hospitals thus have to make impossible choices, so that eventually equal access can no longer be guaranteed. If no other policies are applied, health care goals will no longer be met.

      To evaluate 90-day episode-of-care (EOC) costs associated with robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) versus manual TKA (mTKA).
    


          Patients & methods:
        
      
      TKA procedures were identified in Medicare 100% data. Accounting for baseline differences, propensity score matching was performed 1:5. 90-day EOC and index costs, lengths-of-stay, discharge disposition and readmission rates were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 519 rTKA and 2595 mTKA were included. Overall 90-day EOC costs were US$2391 less for rTKA (p < 0.0001). Over 90% of patients in both cohorts utilized post-acute services, with rTKA accruing fewer costs than mTKA. Post-acute savings can be attributed to discharge destination.

"This paper argues that the current method of determining the availability and pricing of new medicines for public reimbursement in Ireland likely results in too large a share of public healthcare expenditure allocated to medicines. Resources are misallocated. Welfare is lowered. In contrast to some other areas of public healthcare, patients exercise 'voice' rather than 'exit' concerning the public provision of high-cost new medicines. Setting publicly agreed cost-effectiveness thresholds, with clear predictable criteria for when the cost-effectiveness thresholds can be exceeded, would contribute to the creation of a more appropriate new medicine decision-making framework. It would incentivise suppliers to set prices consistent with the decision-making framework. Guidance and clarity raises the possibility of shielding the Health Service Executive, the decision maker, at least partially, from the pressure to fund expensive new medicines that lack cost-effectiveness, while at the same time increasing transparency and predictability.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-017-0536-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28681277/,economics
"Modelers seeking to help inform decisions about insurance (public or private) coverage of the cost of pharmaceuticals or other health care interventions face various methodological challenges. In this review, which is not meant to be comprehensive, we cover those that in our experience are most vexing. The biggest challenge is getting decision makers to trust the model. This is a major problem because most models undergo only cursory validation; our field has lacked the motivation, time, and data to properly validate models intended to inform health care decisions. Without documented, adequate validation, there is little basis for decision makers to have confidence that the model's results are credible and should be used in a health technology appraisal. A fundamental problem for validation is that the models are very artificial and lack sufficient depth to adequately represent the reality they are simulating. Typically, modelers assume that all resources have infinite capacity so any patient needing care receives it immediately; there are no waiting times or queues, contrary to the common experience in actual practice. Moreover, all the patients enter the model simultaneously at time zero rather than over time as happens in actuality; differences between patients are ignored or minimized and structural modeling choices that make little sense (e.g., using states to represent events) are forced by commitment to a technique (and even to specific spreadsheet software!). The resulting structural uncertainty is rarely addressed, because methods are lacking and even probabilistic analysis of parameter uncertainty suffers from weak consideration of correlation and arbitrary distribution choices. Stakeholders must see to it that models are fit for the stated purpose and provide the best possible estimates given available data-the decisions at stake deserve nothing less.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0183-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24986039/,economics
"The primary scope of economic analyses is the quantification of the costs (input) in relation to the results (outcome, output). According to whether a similar or different dimension of outcome parameters is chosen, it is possible to differentiate between cost minimisation, cost effectiveness, cost benefit and cost utility analyses. Decision trees and sensitivity analyses serve to develop or examine cost outcome studies. The principal perspective of economic analysis is of crucial significance. In the present overview of cost control programmes in clinical anaesthesia, the perspective chosen throughout is that of budget responsibility in a department of anaesthesiology. With regard to economic factors in clinical anaesthesiology, the cost of medical and nursing staff represents the largest cost block. It is, therefore, essential that personnel is efficiently employed, i.e. how the perioperative procedure is organised. In the area of material costs, blood products--including coagulation factors and plasma substitutes--are particularly cost intensive, followed by medical products and drugs, especially muscle relaxants and inhalational anaesthetics. In the perioperative context, the costs of anaesthesia personnel account for 5-15% of the total costs of patient care, while material costs account for 2-10%. In view of this small portion of the total costs, cost control programmes in anaesthesia can only make a relatively small contribution to reducing overall cost. However, it must be realised that anaesthesia care is vitally important for the perioperative process which means that in this context cost-effectiveness interventions have consequences that also affect other fields, e.g. postoperative pain service besides anaesthesia. In conducting economic analyses, cost considerations or reductions cannot be targeted alone, but must always also integrate outcome aspects so that costs and quality are regarded in relation to one another.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-994236,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9617420/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Mental disorders are common health problems associated with serious impairment and economic impact.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To estimate the costs of clinical and subthreshold mental disorders in a sample of Brazilian children.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The High Risk Cohort Study is a community study conducted in two major Brazilian cities. Subjects were 6-14 years old children being registered at school. From an initial pool of 9937 children, two subgroups were further investigated using a random-selection (n = 958) and high-risk group selection procedure (n = 1554), resulting in a sample of 2512 subjects. Mental disorder assessment was made using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. Costs for each child were estimated from the following components: mental health and social services use, school problems and parental loss of productivity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Child subthreshold and clinical mental disorders showed lifetime mean total cost of $1750.9 and $3141.2, respectively. National lifetime cost estimate was $9.9 billion for subthreshold mental disorders and $11.6 billion for clinical mental disorders (values in US$ purchasing power parity).

"Pricing and reimbursement of orphan drugs are an issue of high priority for policy makers, legislators, health care professionals, industry leaders, academics and patients. This study aims to conduct a literature review to provide insight into the drivers of orphan drug pricing and reimbursement. Although orphan drug pricing follows the same economic logic as drug pricing in general, the monopolistic power of orphan drugs results in high prices: a) orphan drugs benefit from a period of marketing exclusivity; b) few alternative health technologies are available; c) third-party payers and patients have limited negotiating power; d) manufacturers attempt to maximise orphan drug prices within the constraints of domestic pricing and reimbursement policies; and e) substantial R&D costs need to be recouped from a small number of patients. Although these conditions apply to some orphan drugs, they do not apply to all orphan drugs. Indeed, the small number of patients treated with an orphan drug and the limited economic viability of orphan drugs can be questioned in a number of cases. Additionally, manufacturers have an incentive to game the system by artificially creating monopolistic market conditions. Given their high price for an often modest effectiveness, orphan drugs are unlikely to provide value for money. However, additional criteria are used to inform reimbursement decisions in some countries. These criteria may include: the seriousness of the disease; the availability of other therapies to treat the disease; and the cost to the patient if the medicine is not reimbursed. Therefore, the maximum cost per unit of outcome that a health care payer is willing to pay for a drug could be set higher for orphan drugs to which society attaches a high social value. There is a need for a transparent and evidence-based approach towards orphan drug pricing and reimbursement. Such an approach should be targeted at demonstrating the relative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and economic viability of orphan drugs with a view to informing pricing and reimbursement decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-1172-6-42,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21682893/,economics

      To assess the cost-benefit of the Umthombo Youth Development Foundation (UYDF) scholarship scheme, which has supported the training of HCPs from rural areas in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA, for the past 19 years, and to establish whether it is a worthwhile investment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an economic analysis to estimate the costs and economic value of UYDF's investment in the training of HCPs, using a deterministic model developed in Excel 2010 (Microsoft, USA) to analyse the UYDF's historical, numerical and economic data. Costs were measured in monetary terms, and a rate of return on investment was calculated over the working life of HCPs who had been supported by the UYDF.
    


          Results:
        
      
      With a &gt;90% pass rate, the total cost of training the 254 graduates supported by the UYDF from 2009 to 2015 was estimated to be ZAR186 million. Graduates are expected to generate an estimated ZAR15 billion in lifetime earnings, which is equal to ZAR4 billion at 2015 prices, and represents an internal rate of return of 63%. Income tax paid on future earnings will be ~ZAR4 billion, assuming a 20 - 30% tax rate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The analysis has shown that the cost of HCPs' education, where the annual pass rate is &gt;90%, and &gt;98% of graduates are employed, is an excellent investment. Consideration should be given to finding ways of improving the pass rate at institutions of higher learning and ensuring that graduates obtain meaningful employment if such returns on investment are to be seen on a national level.",https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2020.v110i5.14221,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32657719/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Pay-for-performance (P4P) intents to stimulate both more effective and more efficient health care delivery. To date, evidence on whether P4P itself is an efficient method has not been systematically analyzed.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To identify and analyze the existing literature regarding economic evaluation of P4P.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      English, German, Spanish, and Turkish language literature were searched in the following databases: Business Source Complete, the Cochrane Library, Econlit, ISI web of knowledge, Medline (via PubMed), and PsycInfo (January 2000-April 2010).
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      Articles published in peer-reviewed journals and describing economic evaluations of P4P initiatives. Full economic evaluations, considering costs and consequences of the P4P intervention simultaneously, were the prime focus. Additionally, comparative partial evaluations were included if costs were described and the study allows for an assessment of consequences. Both experimental and observational studies were considered.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, nine studies could be identified. Three studies could be regarded as full economic evaluations, and six studies were classified as partial economic evaluations. Based on the full economic evaluations, P4P efficiency could not be demonstrated. Partial economic evaluations showed mixed results, but several flaws limit their significance. Ranges of costs and consequences were typically narrow, and programs differed considerably in design. Methodological quality assessment showed scores between 32% and 65%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results show that evidence on the efficiency of P4P is scarce and inconclusive. P4P efficiency could not be demonstrated. The small number and variability of included studies limit the strength of our conclusions. More research addressing P4P efficiency is needed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-011-0329-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21660562/,economics
"Is increased spending on medical care harmful to the US economy? The overall share of the gross domestic product spent on medical care is not a problem, provided that the services bought are worth more than their cost. However, high and rising costs expose two often-overlooked problems. First, spending is too high because many dollars are wasted. Estimates suggest that unnecessary medical spending costs the typical American family thousands of dollars each year. Second, high medical costs combined with stagnant incomes for a large share of the population and the inability of governments at all levels to raise tax dollars leads to increased health and economic disparities: fewer people covered by private insurance, the rationing of care in public health programs, and the lack of funds for other social programs. These distribution issues, coupled with the large waste, imply that efforts to address medical spending need to be among our highest priorities.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1626,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29443597/,economics

"We propose reimbursement schemes based on patient classification systems (PCSs) that include adjustments for length of stay (LOS) and exceptional costs and are designed to minimize undesirable effects of economic incentives. In addition, a statistical approach to compare the schemes and the underlying PCSs is proposed, where costs and LOSs for two successive years are used. The first year data provides estimates of the class cost means and the next year's reimbursements which are compared with the second year's costs. This method focuses on the predictive power of a PCS and differs from the usual retrospective analyses based on the proportion of explained variance for single year data. The approach is applied to discharge data of Swiss hospitals where stays are grouped according to five PCSs: All Patient Diagnosis-Related Groups (AP-DRGs), All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (APR-DRGs), International Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (IR-DRGs), Australian Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (AR-DRGs), and SQLape. When adjusting for LOS and outliers, these systems do not differ substantially in their ability to predict cost of stay. Therefore, increasing the number of classes does not necessarily improve cost predictions. However, the payment of a fixed amount per diem (not exceeding the marginal cost) and correcting the reimbursements for exceptional costs substantially reduces the average discrepancy between costs and reimbursements.",https://doi.org/10.1258/095148407781395928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17683659/,economics
"Future costs are not usually included in economic evaluations. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of published economic analyses that incorporate future costs. A systematic review was conducted of economic analyses published from 2008 to 2013 in three general health economics journals: PharmacoEconomics, Value in Health and the European Journal of Health Economics. A total of 192 articles met the inclusion criteria, 94 of them (49.0%) incorporated future related medical costs, 9 (4.2%) also included future unrelated medical costs and none of them included future nonmedical costs. The percentage of articles including future costs increased from 2008 (30.8%) to 2013 (70.8%), and no differences were detected between the three journals. All relevant costs for the perspective considered should be included in economic evaluations, including related or unrelated, direct or indirect future costs.

"At present, pay for prescription models are insufficient at containing costs and improving access to medicines. Subscription financing through tenders, licensing fees and unrestricted or fixed volumes can benefit stakeholders across the supply chain. Pharmaceutical manufacturers can reduce the need for marketing expenses and gain certainty in revenue. This will decrease costs, improve predictability in budget expenditure for payers and remove price as a barrier of access from patients. Inherently, low- and middle-income countries lack the purchasing power to leverage price discounts through typical price arrangements. These markets can realise substantial savings for branded and generic medicines through subscription financing. Procuring of on-patent and off-patent drugs requires separate analysis for competition effects, the length of contract and encouraging innovation in the medicine pipeline. Prices of competitive on-patent medicines and orphan drugs can be reduced through increased competition and volume. Furthermore, pooling expertise and resources through joint procurement has the potential for greater savings. Incentivising research and development within the pharmaceutical industry is essential for sustaining a competitive market, preventing monopolies and improving access to expensive treatments. However, technical capacity, forecasting demand and the quality of generic medicines present limitations which necessitate government support and international partnerships. Ultimately, improving access requires progressive financing mechanisms with patients and cost containment in mind.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133120000031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32122423/,economics

"The availability of the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) system for determining hospital costs in some European countries has encouraged its use in pharmacoeconomic evaluations. The DRG system was developed in the US to provide data for prospective payments for hospitals. However, the financing of hospitals in some European countries is still based on the so-called 'global budget' approach. Therefore, results of pharmacoeconomic studies involving hospitals financed by the 'global-budget' approach in which DRG costs have been used require careful consideration. The main points to consider are: (i) that most of the cost components constituting the DRGs are in fact charges fixed by the government. This cost-charge ratio varies significantly across different DRGs, altering economic consequences when cost-shifting between DRGs; (ii) that there is rarely a perfect concordance between attributable cost (as proposed by the DRGs) and the definition of variable cost (as defined in economic evaluations); (iii) from the Sickness Fund's point of view, the way DRGs could be interpreted is rather unclear: financing or bench-marking?; and (iv) the perspective of DRG cost is a mixed patient-hospital perspective which is neither the societal nor the health insurance perspective generally used in pharmacoeconomic evaluations. In conclusion, the use of DRG costs is a major improvement for pharmacoeconomic evaluation. However, many hypotheses still need to be made in these studies, depending on the economic perspective of the study. Therefore, the results of pharmacoeconomic studies should be considered and discussed in line with the national financing system of the hospitals involved.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200017020-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10947335/,economics
"This study conducts a life cycle environmental and economic quantification comparison of urban runoff source control facilities (URSCFs) through construction and operation stages in two urban functional regions (i.e., residential area and campus). From the environmental perspective, URSCFs construction in residential area has both higher environmental impacts and benefits than that in campus. The operation stage of URSCFs can observe significant benefit for both residential area and campus. We then develop a set of monetized method to make a comprehensive benefit evaluation (i.e., environmental, economic, and social benefit) of URSCFs. Overall, the two areas have payback time less than thirteen years for their investment which is acceptable when compared with the assumed total service period (30 years). Specifically, the payback time of campus is 5.62 years and residential area is 12.44 years. This implies that the campus has great potential to achieve high cost-benefit ratio and thus the Sponge City construction in campus can implement URSCFs with less engineering and material consumption due to its more spacious site than residential area with high building density. For both residential area and campus, permeable pavement has the highest environmental impact and economic cost because of the concrete consumption. Thus, we recommend that it should be cautious of the construction of concrete permeable pavement and find environmentally and economically alternatives in future URSCFs projects.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34883437/,economics
"The paper investigates the benefit the patient derives from medical diagnosis. By considering explicitly the prospects with respect to both health and monetary consequences resulting from a decision taken by the physician, a fairly general approach to discuss diagnostic services is developed. The willingness to pay of the patient is taken to be measured by his compensating option price, evaluated with respect to the reference state without further diagnostic information. Of particular interest are conditions governing positivity of the patient benefit. Imposing additional restrictions upon individual preferences considerably simplifies the analysis by relying on a loss function. The final section discusses the role of the patient benefit as regards cost-benefit analysis of diagnostic services. If health insurance is available providing at least partial coverage, a positive willingness to pay of the patient net of diagnostic cost can be shown to give no clue as to whether utilization of a diagnostic service is beneficial to society in the sense of cost-benefit analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4730030407,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7994325/,economics

"Economic evaluation is an important element of the decision making process for the reimbursement of drugs. Heterogeneity can be considered an explained variation in clinical or economic outcomes based on the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of patients. However, to our knowledge, the relationship between price negotiations and population heterogeneity has not been considered in the literature to date. If a company offers a conditional discount that is dependent on obtaining reimbursement in 2 subgroups or indications, an interaction is generated between groups that should be accounted for in economic evaluations. Critically, where the drug has 2 indications but is only cost-effective in 1 indication at the full price (herein ""indication 1""), the cost savings realized from implementation of the discount in indication 1 can be used to offset the incremental cost of extending reimbursement to indication 2 at the discounted price. This reduces the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and increases the probability of positive reimbursement compared to a stratified approach. Given the additional complexity that this introduces, we introduce a framework deemed the ""hybrid approach"" to guide the economic assessment. We present 2 worked examples. We show that failure to account for the interaction can lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding a drug's cost effectiveness and that adoption of strategic behavior could theoretically increase the reimbursement price of drugs. By adopting this framework, cost-effective interventions are identified that may have been previously misclassified as not being cost-effective and vice versa. Recognition of the interaction in the literature by pharmaceutical companies may influence the forms of discounts offered to decision makers. Therefore, we expect this research to have far-reaching effects on medical decision making.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x19900179,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32009545/,economics
"The hospital services component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the cost of hospital services to private patients paying list prices. It is, however, widely used as an estimate of the overall rate of inflation in hospital prices in spite of the fact that there are strong reasons to believe that it is inappropriate to use the CPI for this purpose. This is because: 1) A growing number of patients are enrolled in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs), which negotiate discounts from list prices; and 2) the size of the discounts may have been increasing. The potential result is a gap between the rate of inflation of list prices and the rate of inflation of actual prices paid in transactions. This study explores whether such a gap exists and determines its possible magnitude. In addition, parallel indices for list and actual prices are computed on the basis of data from California hospitals for fiscal years 1983-1988. The analysis suggests that list price inflation has greatly exceeded actual inflation--by a factor of two for recent years. These findings have broad implications for evaluating not only inflation but also the impact of cost containment strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-199108000-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1875737/,economics
"We present a bibliometric analysis of recently published full economic evaluations of health interventions and reflect critically on the implications of our findings for this growing field. We created a database drawing on 14 health, economic, and/or general literature databases for articles published between 1 January 2012 and 3 May 2014 and identified 2844 economic evaluations meeting our criteria. We present findings regarding the sensitivity, specificity, and added value of searches in the different databases. We examine the distribution of publications between countries, regions, and health areas studied and compare the relative volume of research with disease burden. We analyse authors' country and institutional affiliations, journals and journal type, language, and type of economic evaluation conducted. More than 1200 economic evaluations were published annually, of which 4% addressed low-income countries, 4% lower-middle-income countries, 14% upper-middle-income countries, and 83% high-income countries. Across country income levels, 53, 54, 86, and 100% of articles, respectively, included an author based in a country within the income level studied.

"Why do some states choose to spend more than four times as much as others to provide health care to the disadvantaged? Political scientists who have traditionally explored this question by analyzing trends in overall Medicaid expenditures lumped states' discretionary spending in with other money that states are mandated to spend. Analyses of total expenditures found that socioeconomic factors drove spending but that party control of state legislatures made no difference in health policy making. By isolating discretionary state Medicaid expenditures from total spending figures, I reexamine the influences of political as well as economic and demographic factors. The often-doubted importance of party control becomes clear. This study investigates spending patterns in the discretionary portions of state Medicaid programs in forty-six states from 1980 to 1993 and analyzes both incremental program changes and absolute differences in state spending. To discover how greatly the researcher's choice of dependent variables can affect results, optional spending is separated from total spending levels and the variation is modeled in both. Focusing not on the spending that the federal government requires of state officials but on the policies that state officials actually choose allows a balanced exploration of both political and economic effects on welfare expenditures. This research also provides new insights about which forces will shape policy decisions if more and more control of the public health care system is devolved to the states.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-27-4-639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12374292/,economics

Contrary to the situation without moral hazard, the uniform price does not necessarily dominate discriminatory pricing in welfare terms.

"Health care in most countries is a rather ""local good"" for which the fiscal decentralization theory applies and heterogeneity is the result. In order to address the issue of multijurisdictional health care in estimating income elasticity, we constructed a unique sample using data for 110 regions in eight Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 1997. We estimated this sample data with a multilevel hierarchical model. In doing this, we tried to identify two sources of random variation: within- and between-country variation. The basic purpose was to find out whether the different relationships between health care spending and the explanatory variables are country specific. We concluded that to take into account the degree of fiscal decentralization within countries in estimating income elasticity of health expenditure proves to be important. Two plausible reasons lie behind this: (a) where there is decentralization to the regions, policies aimed at emulating diversity tend to increase national health care expenditure and (b) without fiscal decentralization, central monitoring of finance tends to reduce regional diversity and therefore decrease national health expenditure. The results of our estimation do seem to validate both these points.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-006-0007-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186198/,economics

"Health financing reforms have recently received much attention in developing countries. However, out-of-pocket payments remain substantial. When such payments involve expenditures above some given proportion of household resources, they are often deemed 'catastrophic'. The research literature on defining catastrophe leaves open a number of important questions and as a result there still exists a lack of consensus on the issue. This paper argues that there is a need to examine the question of what might constitute fair indices of catastrophic payment, which explicitly recognize diminishing marginal utility of income as reflected in some principle of vertical equity. It proposes the use of rank-dependent weights to allow variations in threshold payment levels across individuals on the income ladder. These are then applied to a Nigerian data set. It emerged that the catastrophic headcount (positive gap) obtained using a fixed threshold - weighted or not by the concentration index - is lower (higher) than that predicted by the rank-dependent threshold. More fundamentally there is a need for more research effort to take the ideas in this paper further and examine in various different contexts what a fair construct of catastrophe might look like.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133110000356,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21310095/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      This research assesses the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies as an alternative for insurance costs in hospitals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Despite the advantages of RFID, this technology has not been applied in most hospitals due to implementation costs and amortization of RFID. In this paper, we intend to model the total profit of hospitals in three scenarios namely, application of RFID technology in the hospital, without applying RFID technology in the hospital and insuring patients and equipment in the hospital.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We analyzed the aforementioned situations over a period of time to find out how they affect the profit of the hospital. Based on this analysis we concluded that if applying RFID technology is costly, it will be feasible for advanced hospitals with more beds. In the scenario of insuring patients and equipment, if insurance organization takes over a small portion of the cost of the mistakes and oversights, insuring patients and equipment will not be feasible for the hospital, and it is better to apply RFID technology Instead.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RFID is among the technologies applied to reduce mistakes of the personnel in hospitals. Moreover, applying this technology has led to a decrease in the number of personnel required in hospitals. This study models total profit of hospitals in three aforementioned scenarios. Based on analyzing these models we conclude that if applying RFID technology is costly, it will be feasible for advanced hospitals with more beds.",https://doi.org/10.3233/thc-170966,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29278901/,economics

Mid-career workers could fare better because they have more time to rebuild their wealth. They may even gain income if they buy stocks at low prices and get above-average rates of return.

"Beginning with a brief historical overview of health policy in the Netherlands from 1945-1960 (a period of restoration of the capitalist economy after World War II) until 1960-1970 (a period of capitalist expansion), this paper discusses the health policy of the Dutch state under the present conditions of economic crisis. The main characteristics of this policy are growing state intervention, reorganization of the decision-making process, deinstitutionalization of health care, a laissez-faire policy with regard to services in the so-called first echelon of the health sector, reprivatization of health costs, and an ideological emphasis on individual responsibility for health and self-care. The paper concludes with a discussion of the various strategies proposed for the health sector by the Left and the connection between prevention and social struggle.",https://doi.org/10.2190/d1cy-491a-4mn8-p50m,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6370879/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      The economic burden data can provide a basis to inform investments in cholera control and prevention activities. However, treatment costs and productivity loss due to cholera are not well studied.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We included Asian countries that either reported cholera cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 or were considered cholera endemic in 2015 global burden of disease study. Public health service delivery costs for hospitalization and outpatient costs, out-of-pocket costs to patients and households, and lost productivity were extracted from literature. A probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analysis was conducted for key outputs using Monte Carlo simulation. Scenario analyses were conducted using data from the WHO cholera reports and conservative and liberal disease burden estimates.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our analysis included 14 Asian countries that were estimated to have a total of 850,000 cholera cases and 25,500 deaths in 2015 While, the WHO cholera report documented around 60,000 cholera cases and 28 deaths. We estimated around $20.2 million (I$74.4 million) in out-of-pocket expenditures, $8.5 million (I$30.1 million) in public sector costs, and $12.1 million (I$43.7 million) in lost productivity in 2015. Lost productivity due to premature deaths was estimated to be $985.7 million (I$3,638.6 million). Our scenario analyses excluding mortality costs showed that the economic burden ranged from 20.3% ($8.3 million) to 139.3% ($57.1 million) in high and low scenarios when compared to the base case scenario ($41 million) and was least at 10.1% ($4.1 million) when estimated based on cholera cases reported to WHO.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The economic burden of cholera in Asia provides a better understanding of financial offsets that can be achieved, and the value of investments on cholera control measures. With a clear understanding of the limitations of the underlying assumptions, the information may be used in economic evaluations and policy decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.09.099,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31611097/,economics
"A number of low and middle income countries (LMICs) are considering social health insurance (SHI) for adoption into their social and economic environment or striving to sustain and improve already existing SHI schemes. SHI was first introduced in Germany in 1883. An analysis of the German system from its inception up to today may yield lessons relevant to other countries. Such an analysis, however, is largely lacking, especially with regard to LMICs. This paper attempts to fill this gap. For each of the following lessons, it considers if and under which conditions they may be of relevance to LMICs. First, small, informal, voluntary health insurance schemes may serve as learning models for fund administration and solidarity, but in order to achieve universal coverage government action is needed to formalise these schemes and to introduce a principle of compulsion. Once compulsory health insurance exists for some people, incremental expansion of coverage to other regions and social groups may be feasible to achieve universality. Second, in order to ensure sustainability of SHI, the mandated benefit package should be adapted incrementally in accordance with changing needs, values and economic circumstances. Third. in a pluralistic SHI system equity, as well as risk pooling and spreading, can be enhanced if funds merge. The optimal number of funds, however, will depend on the stage of development of the SHI system as well as on other objectives of the system, including choice and competition. A risk equalisation scheme may prevent the adverse effects of risk selection, if competition between insurance funds is introduced into the system. Fourth, as an alternative to both state and market regulation, self-governance may serve as a source of stability and sustainability as well as a means of decentralising and democratising a health care system. Finally, costs can be successfully contained in a fee-for-service system, if cost-escalating provider behaviour is constrained by either political pressure or technical means.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00137-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12061488/,economics
"We explore how competition between physicians affects medical service provision. Previous research has shown that, without competition, physicians deviate from patient-optimal treatment under payment systems like capitation and fee-for-service. Although competition might reduce these distortions, physicians usually interact with each other repeatedly over time and only a fraction of patients switches providers at all. Both patterns might prevent competition to work in the desired direction. To analyze the behavioral effects of competition, we develop a theoretical benchmark that is then tested in a controlled laboratory experiment. Experimental conditions vary physician payment and patient characteristics. Real patients benefit from provision decisions made in the experiment. Our results reveal that, in line with the theoretical prediction, introducing competition can reduce overprovision and underprovision, respectively. The observed effects depend on patient characteristics and the payment system, though. Tacit collusion is observed and particularly pronounced with fee-for-service payment, but it appears to be less frequent than in related experimental research on price competition.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3583,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29285872/,economics
"This study examined the sensitivity towards increases in user charges for different types of drugs and among different socio-economic groups. It was based on responses by 2008 consumers of prescription drugs to a self-administered postal questionnaire sent to a random sample of 8000 inhabitants in Uppsala County in Sweden. The questionnaire included a question about whether the respondents would use fewer prescription drugs if the user charges increased by a specific amount. The increase in user charges was varied between 9 and 150% in five different subsamples. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the probability that a respondent would reduce consumption of prescription drugs as a function of the size of the user charges increase, socio-economic characteristics and the type of drug used. Results showed that the price sensitivity decreased with increasing age, income, education and self-rated health status. Price sensitivity was highest for antitussives and lowest for climacteric drugs. If the user charges doubled, 40% of antitussives users would reduce their consumption whereas only 11% of climacteric drugs users would reduce their consumption. It is concluded that sensitivity to increases in user charges varied greatly between different types of drugs and between socio-economic groups. The young, those with poor health status, low education and low income are most likely to decrease consumption of prescription drugs when user charges increase.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(98)00009-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180677/,economics

"Pharmaco-epidemiology, which has emerged within the last 20 years as a new discipline in human medicine, deals with the quantities of drugs consumed and their effects on populations in terms of epidemiological concepts and tools. To a lesser extent, it is also practised in veterinary medicine. The applications presented in this review are illustrative of pharmaco-epidemiological and -economical concepts. Assessment of drug consumption, the study of adverse drug effects, and the economic implications of drug use are the three main fields considered. Developments can be expected in veterinary medicine within the next few years relative to novel areas of interest such as antimicrobial resistance and new therapeutic class uses. These applications will require methodological progress and the elimination of current gaps. Pharmaco-epidemiological methods need to be developed, which implies close co-operation between statisticians, pharmacologists, veterinary practitioners and epidemiologists. A greater use of the term 'pharmaco-epidemiology' as a keyword in literature would facilitate recognition of this domain which associates closely epidemiology and pharmacology.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2885.2002.00443.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12485351/,economics
"In this article, we interrogate the policy response of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the global financial crisis, and discuss the likely global health implications, especially in low-income countries. In doing so, we ask if the IMF has meaningfully loosened its fiscal deficit targets in light of the economic challenges posed by the financial crisis and adjusted its macro-economic policy advice to this new reality; or has the rhetoric of counter-cyclical spending failed to translate into additional fiscal space for IMF loan-recipient countries, with negative health consequences? To answer these questions, we assess several post-crisis IMF lending agreements with countries requiring financial assistance, and draw upon recent academic studies and civil society reports examining policy conditionalities still being prescribed by the IMF. We also reference recent studies examining the health impacts of these conditionalities. We demonstrate that while the IMF has been somewhat more flexible in its crisis response than in previous episodes of financial upheaval, there has been no meaningful rethinking in the application of dominant neoliberal macro-economic policies. After showing some flexibility in the initial crisis response, the IMF is pushing for excessive contraction in most low and middle-income countries. We conclude that there remains a wide gap between the rhetoric and the reality of the IMF's policy and programming advice, with negative implications for global health.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/das016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22504946/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      This paper introduces a framework with which to conceptualize the decision-making process in health technology assessment for new interventions with high budgetary impacts. In such circumstances, the use of a single threshold based on the marginal productivity of the healthcare system is inappropriate. The implications of this for potential partial implementation, horizontal equity, and pharmaceutical pricing are illustrated using this framework.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Under the condition of perfect divisibility and given an objective of maximizing health, a large budgetary impact of a new treatment may imply that optimal implementation is partial rather than full, even at a given incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that would nevertheless mean the decision to accept the treatment in full would not lead to a net reduction in health. In a one-shot price-setting game, this seems to give rise to potential horizontal equity concerns. When the assumption of fixity of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (arising from the assumed exogeneity of the manufacturer's price) is relaxed, it can be shown that the threat of partial implementation may be sufficient to give rise to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at which cost the entire potential population is treated, maximizing health at an increased level, and with no contravention of the horizontal equity principle.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.04.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31426930/,economics
"The financial crisis illustrated the need for a functional understanding of systemic risk in strongly interconnected financial structures. Dynamic processes on complex networks being intrinsically difficult to model analytically, most recent studies of this problem have relied on numerical simulations. Here we report analytical results in a network model of interbank lending based on directly relevant financial parameters, such as interest rates and leverage ratios. We obtain a closed-form formula for the ""critical degree"" (the number of creditors per bank below which an individual shock can propagate throughout the network), and relate failures distributions to network topologies, in particular scalefree ones. Our criterion for the onset of contagion turns out to be isomorphic to the condition for cooperation to evolve on graphs and social networks, as recently formulated in evolutionary game theory. This remarkable connection supports recent calls for a methodological rapprochement between finance and ecology.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130948,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26207631/,economics
"The use of haptic feedback is currently an underused modality in the driving environment, especially with respect to vehicle manufacturers. This exploratory study evaluates the effects of a vibrotactile (or haptic) accelerator pedal on car driving performance and perceived workload using a driving simulator. A stimulus was triggered when the driver exceeded a 50% throttle threshold, past which is deemed excessive for economical driving. Results showed significant decreases in mean acceleration values, and maximum and excess throttle use when the haptic pedal was active as compared to a baseline condition. As well as the positive changes to driver behaviour, subjective workload decreased when driving with the haptic pedal as compared to when drivers were simply asked to drive economically. The literature suggests that the haptic processing channel offers a largely untapped resource in the driving environment, and could provide information without overloading the other attentional resource pools used in driving.

"Aims:
        
      
      Previous studies have indicated the negative effects of socioeconomic deprivation on health status and morbidity. Nevertheless, the economic assignment systems for pharmaceutical benefits in Sweden do not take socioeconomic status (SES) into account. The aim of the study was, therefore, to compare reimbursement for subsidized drugs at primary healthcare centres (HCCs) with differing socioeconomic conditions in relation to real costs. The word reimbursement is used to denote economic compensation to the HCCs from the county council for drug benefit costs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The numbers of individuals dispensed drugs, total costs and reimbursement at five HCCs with different socioeconomic conditions were compared. A socioeconomic index was calculated for each HCC on the basis of information from the municipality registries on income (with negative sign), assistance allowance, education, foreign background, and unemployment. Register data on drug benefit costs were retrieved from the National Corporation of Pharmacies (Apoteket AB) and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register at the National Board of Health and Welfare. Data on listed and unlisted citizens at the Kalmar County Council and on public statistics from registers at the HCC municipalities where the HCCs were situated were retrieved.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was an almost inverse linear relationship between total cost compensation and the socioeconomic index (n = 5; r =-0.99; p = 0.001). The HCCs with the lowest SES received lower cost compensation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      HCCs responsible for citizens with lower SES appeared to be disadvantaged by the prevalent reimbursement system in Sweden, thereby increasing differences in the state of health of the citizens. This, in turn, hampers health preventing programmes and lifestyle interventions. An HCC-specific standardized summary of socioeconomic burden is presented.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494809106544,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19546143/,economics
"There is increasing interest in the use of economic evaluations in healthcare, because of the need to maximise health benefits from limited resources. The focus of most economic evaluations is on efficiency, though they may also consider the issue of equity. In an economic evaluation, it is important to consider all the relevant costs, not just the acquisition cost of the treatment. Likewise, it is important to include all the benefits in the economic appraisal, although the outcomes of relevance to decision-makers may differ according to their perspective. If an intervention costs less but delivers fewer benefits than the comparator or, more commonly, a new intervention increases benefits compared with standard therapy but at increased cost, decision-makers must consider whether the extra cost is worth the extra benefit. This depends on the opportunity cost of introducing the new intervention - i.e. the benefit forgone by doing less of something else to fund it. In other words, decision-makers need to decide on the maximum amount they are willing to pay for an additional unit of health benefit. The result of an economic evaluation will be strongly influenced by the information used in the analysis. Currently, clinical trials are the most common source of data for economic evaluations. Yet there are a number of limitations in the information generated by clinical trials, which are primarily designed for regulatory approval. Consequently, decision analytical models are being increasingly used to synthesise data from various sources and to manage uncertainty in input parameters. When using economic evaluations, decision-makers may be unwilling to take a broad perspective on costs, focusing instead on their narrow budgetary concerns. Incentives may be required within healthcare systems to ensure that decision-makers adhere more strictly to the results of formal analysis.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200119002-00004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11700785/,economics
"This paper examines why for-profit dialysis providers have displaced non-profit providers over the last 25 years. Using detailed data on individual markets' evolutions, I find that for-profit facilities were quicker to enter growing markets and slower to exit declining ones than non-profit facilities. Moreover, for-profit providers' presence in a market had a larger impact on the exit and entry behavior of competitors. These results suggest that for-profit dialysis providers have an advantage in static competition relative to non-profit providers, and that this-rather than lower entry costs-explains their increasing prominence. Additional empirical analyses indicate that for-profits' advantage cannot solely be attributed to efficiencies related to membership in a large, multi-facility chain. This further suggests that managerial incentives have had an economically significant impact on long-run market structure in this industry.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-016-9192-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27878689/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Previous research has shown that pharmacoeconomic (PE) data are considered important but may not be optimally utilized by decision makers. No research has compared the effectiveness of different types of PE models.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to examine the perceived value and understanding of PE models among decision makers in managed care organizations. The perspective of this study was from research scientists working in the pharmaceutical industry who present PE models to managed care clients. The study objectives were to (1) examine what types of models are best received by decision makers, (2) investigate the barriers to using PE models, and (3) recommend methods for improving PE models.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A telephone survey of 39 items was conducted with 20 PE research scientists from various U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Topics addressed included factors contributing to how well PE models are received, barriers to using PE models, and recommendations for improving PE models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Models have an impact on health policy decision making. Nineteen of 20 respondents had at least one experience where a PE model played a role in optimizing the formulary positioning of a product. No single model format (e.g., decision analytic tools, spreadsheet analyses, Markov models, multivariate regression models) was regarded as the most effective model type. Although 7 of 20 respondents said simple spreadsheet models were most effective, well-designed, scientifically sound regression models were also reported to be very effective.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The respondents commonly used models to share PE information, which was said to play a role in making health policy decisions by decision makers in managed care. There was no consensus regarding the type of model that was most effective. Study participants indicated that a variety of model designs are effective, ranging from simple spreadsheet models to multivariate regression models. Recommendations for improving PE models include (1) producing scientifically sound models, (2) customizing models where possible, (3) making models transparent, (4) making models user friendly, and (5) involving a nonbiased third party for model development.",https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.2.159,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14613345/,economics
"Policy-makers worldwide are on a quest to control national spending for health care and to enhance the value received for whatever is being spent on health care. One should think that the economic evaluation of clinical practice would play a major role in this quest. Alas, so far it has not, in spite of considerable progress in the development of suitable methodology for such evaluations. The central point of this paper is that the sheer conceptual and practical complexities of economic evaluations in this context are not the only and possibly not the major barrier to a more widespread use of this type of analysis. Just as important may be the suspicion among lay persons that such analyses are easily driven by the assumptions the analyst packages into the analysis which, in turn, opens economic evaluation to hidden bias toward favored results. It is proposed in this paper that this particular barrier to the use of economic evaluations in health policy could be overcome if these analyses were more routinely subjected to the rigorous and penetrating audits that are customary in financial accounting. Typically, research papers in economics are audited through peer review only as to the methodology employed. The suggestions here is that a proper, respectable audit ought to penetrate all the way to the data that were used to produce the findings in a study.

We used a mixed effects logistic regression model to estimate physicians' choice of three alternative payment models: fee for service, enhanced fee for service, and blended capitation. We found that primary care physicians self-selected into payment models based on existing practice characteristics. Physicians with more complex patient populations were less likely to switch into capitation-based payment models where higher levels of effort were not financially rewarded. These findings suggested that investigations aimed at assessing the impact of different primary care reimbursement models on outcomes, including costs and access, should first account for potential selection effects.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3221,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26190516/,economics

At hospitals where Medicare is a small payer relative to private insurers, up to 37% of BBA cuts was transferred to private payers through higher payments.

"In this study, the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is examined with the newly developed bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach by incorporating the effects of trade openness for Turkey from 1969 to 2017. The bootstrap ARDL approach results show that there is a long-run relationship between per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, per capita real income, and trade openness in the presence of one structural break. The results of the long-run estimators indicate that the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis is valid, and trade openness has an increasing impact on CO2 emissions. However, Turkey has not yet reached the level of income necessary to reduce pollution. The results of the Fourier Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality test also show that unidirectional causality runs through per capita real income and trade openness to per capita CO2 emissions. In addition to these findings, it has been determined that the decrease in growth rate and production experienced during the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey reduced environmental pollution in both the short and long runs. Consequently, these results show that the scale and composition effects outweigh for economic growth and trade openness in Turkey.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05266-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31098905/,economics

We considered the relevance of applying economics to address 4 key challenges of ecological restoration: assessing social and economic benefits, estimating overall costs, project prioritization and selection, and long-term financing of restoration programs. We found it is uncommon to consider all types of benefits (such as nonmarket values) and costs (such as transaction costs) in restoration programs. Total benefit of a restoration project can be estimated using market prices and various nonmarket valuation techniques. Total cost of a project can be estimated using methods based on property or land-sale prices, such as hedonic pricing method and organizational surveys.

The first national government to signal such an intention is the Commonwealth Government of Australia, which from January 1993 will require economic analyses in support of applications for listing of new pharmaceutical products on its schedule of pharmaceutical benefits. This move is underpinned by legislation that requires the country's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) to consider costs and effectiveness when recommending listing of new drugs. The approach that has been recommended to the Committee is based on advice from a group of consultants, health economists and clinicians. The PBAC will use economic analyses as an aid to decision-making that will remain within a clinical framework; the viewpoint will be societal, and analyses will include costs that fall outside the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The preferred approach is comparative cost-effectiveness analysis with a particular emphasis on the marginal costs of obtaining additional health benefits with new drugs, compared with existing therapies. The use of analyses that are restricted to potential cost savings with new drugs is discouraged, as is the inclusion of indirect costs and benefits. To facilitate the conduct of economic analyses, it is planned to hold meetings with specialist clinicians to obtain consensus on a range of intermediate clinical outcome indicators, and to publish lists of 'standard' Australian costs that will be updated regularly. The approach being followed in Australia has implications for both the government and the pharmaceutical industry. The responsibility for monitoring the effects of this new policy lie with the government. The success, or otherwise, of the policy should not be gauged simply by the effects on the price of new drugs which, historically, have been relatively low in Australia. A full evaluation will require that more effort be put into clinical outcomes research and the development of population databases, an area in which Australia lags behind other countries.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199201010-00010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10147039/,economics
"The introduction of regulated competition in health care in several Western countries confronts health care providing organizations with changing relationships, with their environment and a need for knowledge and skills to analyse and improve their market position. Marketing receives more and more attention, as recent developments in this field of study provide a specific perspective on the relationships between an organization and external and internal parties. In doing so, a basis is offered for network management. A problem is that the existing marketing literature is not entirely appropriate for the specific characteristics of health care. After a description of the developments in marketing and its most recent key concepts, the applicability of these concepts in health-care organizations is discussed. States that for the health-care sector, dominated by complex networks of interorganizational relationships, the strategic marketing vision on relationships can be very useful. At the same time however, the operationalization of these concepts requires special attention and a distinct role of the management of health-care organizations, because of the characteristics of such organizations and the specific type of their service delivery.",https://doi.org/10.1108/02689239410073321,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10140626/,economics

"The introduction of expensive disease-modifying agents for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has created the potential for patients with MS to become higher contributors to healthcare spending. In an attempt to make formulary and reimbursement choices for these agents, decision-makers may look to the literature for guidance. This critical review attempts to decipher a consistent message from the available economic literature regarding the relationship between disease severity and cost in MS. In the 2 studies that have examined MS disease severity, a positive correlation with total (direct and indirect) cost, indirect cost and some, if not all, components of direct cost was reported. In studies taking the societal perspective, the majority of total costs were indirect. This paper documents the high burden of MS on society and serves to guide the decision-maker in interpreting the MS economic literature such that this information can be optimally utilised to make informed resource allocation decisions.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199915030-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10537431/,economics

How extensively should a diagnostic search be conducted; and where does the best path run through the maze of potential combinations of tests and therapies? Physicians have hoped that economic and medical decision analyses would help them to find the most cost-effective and most efficacious means to deal with dyspepsia. Because of the large variety of potential diagnoses, diagnostic procedures and therapeutic means, however, it is very doubtful that a single most effective or least expensive strategy can ever be developed to apply to every patient with dyspepsia.

"Objective:
        
      
      To examine the impact of commercial dental insurer and provider concentration on dentist reimbursement.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      We utilized provider data from the American Dental Association, reimbursement data from IBM Watson MarketScan® Commercial Research Databases, submitted billed charges from FAIR Health® , dental insurance market concentration data from FAIR Health® , and county-level demographic and economic data from the Area Health Resources File and the Council for Community and Economic Research.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      We used the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to separately measure commercial dental insurance concentration and dentist concentration. We studied the effect of provider and insurance concentration on dentist reimbursement. Using two-stage least squares, we accounted for potential endogeneity in dental insurer and provider concentration.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      Across the dental procedures we examined, a 10 percent increase in dental insurance concentration is associated with a 1.95 percent (P-value = .033) reduction in gross payments to dentists. Conversely, a 10 percent increase in dentist concentration is associated with a more modest 0.71 percent (P-value = .024) increase in gross payments. A 10 percent increase in dental insurance concentration is associated with a 1.16 percentage point (P-value = .016) decline in the allowed-to-list price ratio, while a 10 percent increase in dentist concentration is associated with a 0.56 percentage point (P-value = .001) increase in the allowed-to-list price ratio. Similar patterns were found across dental procedure subcategories.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dental provider markets are substantially less concentrated than insurance markets, which may limit the ability of dentists to garner higher reimbursement.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13544,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32844447/,economics
"As the costs of the American health care system escalate, there is a tendency to identify the biggest cost item and attempt to reduce it to a manageable size. However, since that biggest cost item, the hospital, is a creation of uncontrolled forces within the system as a whole, attempts to manage costs will be limited in effectiveness. The hospital is the end product of an uncontrolled system, a product that displays little understanding of the economic principles of trade-off, efficiency, and productivity. To limit spending in the hospital care system, controls must be rooted in an analysis of the forces that have shaped the hospital's present form and structure. Factors to be considered are those that have defined what a ""good"" hospital is, who its real consumers are, and what economic and quality control factors must be part of the entire health system. This article suggests modification of public policies relative to medical manpower an insurance, and recommends adoption of reimbursement by Diagnostic Related Groups.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-7-1-254,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6809807/,economics

"More and more countries employ the Carbon Cap and Trade mechanism (CCT-mechanism) to stimulate the manufacturer to produce much more eco-friendly products. In this paper, we study how the CCT-mechanism affects competitive manufacturers' product design and pricing strategies. Assume that there are two competitive manufacturers; we give the optimal closed form solutions of the carbon emission reduction rates and retail prices in the Nash game model and the Stackelberg game model with CCT-mechanism, respectively. Additionally, we also discuss the impacts of CCT-mechanism, consumer environmental awareness (CEA), and the sensitivity of switchovers toward price on the optimal carbon emission reduction rates, retail prices, and manufacturers' profits. We find that (i) when the carbon quota is not enough, there is a trade off between investing in producing much greener product and purchasing carbon quota; when the carbon price is not high, the manufacturer tends to purchase the carbon quota; and when the carbon price is much higher, the manufacturer is more willing to increase the environmental quality of the product; (ii) manufacturer's size affects product's emission reduction rate and manufacturer's optimal profit; larger manufacturer tends to produce much greener product, but it does not mean that he could obtain much more money than the small manufacturer; and (iii) the decision sequence changes manufacturer's strategies; the optimal emission reduction rate in Nash and Stackelberg game models are almost the same, but the differences of prices and profits between Nash and Stackelberg model's are much bigger.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15112570,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30453588/,economics
"Global budget payment is one of the most effective strategies for cost containment, but its impacts on provider behavior have not been explored in detail. This study examines the theoretical and empirical role of global budget payment on provider behavior. The study proposes that global budget payment with price adjustment is a form of common-pool resources. A two-product game theoretic model is derived, and simulations demonstrate that hospitals are expected to expand service volumes, with an emphasis on products with higher price-marginal cost ratios. Next, the study examines the early effects of Taiwan's global budget payment system using a difference-in-difference strategy and finds that Taiwanese hospitals exhibited such behavior, where the pursuit of individual interests led to an increase in treatment intensities. Furthermore, hospitals significantly increased inpatient service volume for regional hospitals and medical centers. In contrast, local hospitals, particularly for those without teaching status designation, faced a negative impact on service volume, as larger hospitals were better positioned to induce demand and pulled volume away from their smaller counterparts through more profitable services and products such as radiology and pharmaceuticals.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3095,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25132007/,economics
"The theme of World Diabetes Day for 1999 is 'The Costs of Diabetes'. This theme was chosen quite purposely to reflect the broad nature in which diabetes affects individuals, families, and society. For the theme can highlight the importance of diabetes from a medical, social, or economic perspective. This presentation addresses two issues, cost-effectiveness analysis and financial barriers to care, that pertain to the economic viewpoint. Economically, the costs of diabetes are varied. They include items that one can easily recognize, such as the expenditures related to medical treatment for diabetes (direct costs) or the earnings lost to individuals prematurely disabled or dying young (indirect costs). Other less well known costs exists as well. These include the opportunity costs to individuals with diabetes who forego other 'opportunities in life' because they made a decision to devote their financial or time resources to diabetes care. They also include costs to society, such as the impact of using existing resources in diabetes care unwisely, or having inappropriate priorities. Cost-effectiveness analyses in diabetes care address this last point. Health insurance issues highlight one aspect of opportunity costs in diabetes care.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8227(01)00303-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11580963/,economics
"Based on the panel data of 24 provinces from 2010 to 2018, the static panel model was utilized to analyze the impact of fiscal decentralization and economic growth on poverty reduction, and the Moran index was used to calculate the spatial agglomeration effect of poverty degree. Further, we employed Spatial Dobbin model to examine the spatial effect of fiscal decentralization, economic growth, and poverty reduction. Findings of our results revealed that the rapid economic growth and fiscal revenue decentralization have a substantial inhibitory effect on poverty reduction, and fiscal expenditure decentralization has an important promoting influence on poverty reduction. Our results further showed that the degree of inter provincial poverty has significant effect on regional spatial agglomeration, indicating a pattern of high-value agglomeration in the northwestern and southern border areas and low-value agglomeration in the northeastern and central regions. Finally, the results revealed that economic growth rate and fiscal decentralization have spatial spillover effects on the poverty governance.

"Policy-makers desire an optimal balance of financial incentives to improve productivity and encourage improved quality in primary care, while also avoiding issues of risk-selection inherent to capitation-based payment. In this paper we analyze risk-selection in capitation-based payment by using administrative data for patients (n = 11,600,911) who were rostered (i.e., signed an enrollment form, or received a majority of care) with a primary care physician (n = 8621) in Ontario, Canada in 2010/11. We analyze this data using a relative distribution approach and compare distributions of patient costs and morbidity across primary care payment models. Our results suggest a relationship between being in a capitation-based payment scheme and having low cost patients (and presumably healthy patients) compared to fee-for-service physicians. However, we do not have evidence that physicians in capitation-based models are reducing the care they provide to sick and high cost patients. These findings suggest there is a relationship between payment type and risk-selection, particularly for low-cost and healthy patients.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.11.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25461858/,economics
"This study documents the increases in real inputs (e.g., labor and equipment) employed in Ontario's hospital sector between 1968 and 1981--a period of universal government-financed hospital insurance and a government regulatory strategy involving global budgeting. Total expenditures in Ontario increased by only 16 per cent in terms of real inputs, as compared with an increase of 101 per cent in the United States. Real inputs per patient-day increased at a mean annual rate of 0.68 per cent in Ontario versus 5.19 per cent in the United States (P less than 0.001). Real inputs per admission decreased at a mean annual rate of 1.12 per cent in Ontario, as compared with an increase of 4.15 per cent in the United States (P less than 0.0001). We conclude that regulation can contain the growth of real inputs employed in the hospital sector even in the face of an incentive structure that does not promote cost consciousness on the part of patients or physicians. Although the effect of this strategy on the quality of care is unknown, so far it appears to have been politically acceptable in Ontario.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198307213090306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6683358/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the desirability and feasibility of a cyclic reimbursement process to address uncertainty accompanying initial decision making.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed desk research for three expensive outpatient drugs: imatinib, pegfilgrastim, and adalimumab. We analysed the evidence base at the time of decision making (T=0) and May 2011 (T=1). For T=0, public reports of the Dutch reimbursement agency were investigated regarding available clinical and economic evidence, and a systematic review was performed to retrieve additional economic evidence. For T=1, the systematic review was extended till May 2011.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The evidence base at T=0 lacked information on clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, and quality of life (5/8 reports), (long-term) adverse events (2/8 reports) and experience in use (1/8 reports). One budget impact analysis and one economic evaluation were available but no pharmacoeconomic dossiers. The systematic review identified 39 cost-utility studies (of 52 economic evaluations) for T=1, characterised by methodological heterogeneity.
    


          Conclusions:

To do that, it relies on results from a sample of residents of Colombo. The willingness to pay function is found to be unusual. It increases at an increasing rate for hypothetical reductions in the elephant population compared to its current level (a level that makes the Asian elephant endangered) and also increases at a decreasing rate for increases in this population from its current level. Rational explanations are given for this relationship. The relationship is, however, at odds with relationships suggested in some of the literature for total economic value as a function of the abundance of a wildlife species. It is suggested that willingness to pay for conservation of a species rationally includes a strategic element and may not always measure the total economic value of a species.

"To determine the influence of the weight of the economic effectiveness evaluation criteria of the major investments of listed enterprises, and provide new management ideas for the development of the follow-up enterprises, firstly, the financial benefit evaluation system of investment projects is analyzed and constructed, and the specific evaluation process is analyzed. Then, on this basis, the evaluation index is refined; the basic structure of BP neural network (BPNN) is introduced, and genetic algorithm is used to improve BP neural network. The cost-benefit analysis model is constructed based on the improved BPNN. The listed company A is taken as an example to analyze its development data in recent years, and then the data of 10 listed companies are taken as the research object. Matlab simulation software is used to train and verify the improved BPNN model, analyze and predict the weight value of the financial benefit index of the investment projects of these 10 companies, and then determine the index to improve the financial benefit of the investment projects. Under the analysis of the development data of listed company A in the past 10 years, it is found that the indicators of the listed company's profitability per share, debt risk operation ability, development, and growth ability in the past 10 years are in relatively stable state. The principal component analysis of its 20 secondary sub-indexes is conducted based on the four primary indicators: profitability, debt risk, operational capacity, and development and growth. A total of eight principal components including return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), (total asset turnover) TATO, turnover of account receivable (AR), asset-liability ratio, interest protection multiple, income growth rate, and year-on-year rate of increase for complete assets are extracted. The average error between the final output value, the actual value, and the expected value is 0.0304 and 0.0169, respectively. The weight coefficient of the monetary benefits evaluation indicator of investment items is calculated, and the computed results show that year-on-year rate of increase for complete assets, TOTA, ROA, turnover of total capital, and ROE are important indexes in the financial benefit evaluation of investment projects. It indicates that to improve the financial benefit of investment projects of listed enterprises, it is necessary to enhance the year-over-year growth degree of total properties and ROA.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229739,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32134951/,economics

We contribute to this debate presenting a transfer system that, under some circumstances, attains both provider efficiency and no risk selection.

"To generate current incidence-based estimates of the direct medical costs of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the United States, a Markov model of the economic costs of CAD-related medical care was developed. Risks of initial and subsequent CAD events (sudden CAD death, fatal/nonfatal acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina, and stable angina) were estimated using new Framingham Heart Study risk equations and population risk profiles derived from national survey data. Costs were assumed to be those related to treatment of initial and subsequent CAD events (""event-related"") and follow-up care (""nonevent-related""), respectively. Cost estimates were derived primarily from national public-use databases. First-year direct medical costs of treating CAD events are estimated to be $17,532 for fatal AMI, $15,540 for nonfatal AMI, $2,569 for stable angina, $12,058 for unstable angina, and $713 for sudden CAD death. Nonevent-related direct costs of CAD treatment are estimated to be $1,051 annually. The annual incidence of CAD in the United States is estimated at 616,900 cases, with first-year costs of treatment totaling $5.54 billion. Five- and 10-year cumulative costs in 1995 dollars for patients who are initially free of CAD are estimated at $9.2 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively; for all patients with CAD, these costs are estimated to be $71.5 billion and $126.6 billion, respectively.

"Background:
        
      
      Current health economic analysis guidelines emphasize the importance of using nationally appropriate cost and valuation inputs. However, some countries lack national data, and some analyses focus on interventions with costs and benefits at regional or global scales.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Recognizing the need for better estimates of appropriate values for application at these levels than those used in the past, we characterize population-weighted dollar per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted by World Bank Income Level based on available national estimates of the marginal productivity of the healthcare system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The defaults suggested here reflect health opportunity costs across countries more consistent with existing evidence than those previously used or recommended. As countries change income levels and healthcare spending, and as additional or updated marginal productivity of healthcare expenditure estimates become available, we expect the defaults to change.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The best option for informing decisions around resource allocation in health care such that they improve health outcomes overall remains the use of time-appropriate country-specific estimates of the marginal productivity of the healthcare system. Instead of single, time-invariant defaults, health economists should seek to develop valuation inputs that better account for health opportunity costs and do so over time.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2020.1812387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32954900/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Demographic and epidemiological changes place an increasing reliance on informal carers. Some support programmes exist, but funding is often limited. There is a need for economic evaluation of interventions for carers to assist policymakers in prioritizing carer support.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our aim was to systematically review and critically appraise cost-utility analyses of interventions for informal carers, in order to assess the methods employed and the quality of the reporting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of databases was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and EconLit of items published between 1950 and February 2019. Published studies were selected if they involved a cost-utility analysis of an intervention mainly or jointly targeting informal carers. The reporting quality of economic analyses was evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An initial set of 1364 potentially relevant studies was identified. The titles and the abstracts were then screened, resulting in the identification of 62 full-text articles that warranted further assessment of their eligibility. Of these, 20 economic evaluations of informal carer interventions met the inclusion criteria. The main geographical area was the UK (n = 11). These studies were conducted in mental and/or behavioural (n = 15), cardiovascular (n = 3) or cancer (n = 2) clinical fields. These cost-utility analyses were based on randomized clinical trials (n = 16) and on observational studies (n = 4), of which only one presented a Markov model-based economic evaluation. Four of the six psychological interventions were deemed to be cost effective versus two of the four education/support interventions, and four of the nine training/support interventions. Two articles achieved a CHEERS score of 100% and nine of the economic evaluations achieved a score of 85% in terms of the CHEERS criteria for high-quality economic studies.

We contrast selection incentives, measured by service selection elasticities, across six plan types using privately-insured claims data from 73 large employers from 2008 to 2014. Compared to flat capitation, concurrent risk adjustment reduces the elasticity by 47%, prospective risk adjustment by 43%, simple reinsurance system by 32%, and combined concurrent risk adjustment with reinsurance by 60%.

      Mental health economic studies were ascertained through a systematic Medline search, chasing references at the end of papers acquired from the initial medline search and details of studies furnished by members of the WHO collaborating centre.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Only a small number of mental health economic studies from developing countries were identified. They were mainly cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness studies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Psychiatric disorders impose a significant burden in developing countries. It is not always possible to extrapolate findings from developed countries to developing countries. Potential avenues for future research and development are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0447.2000.9r004.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10706008/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to assess relationships between county-level variation in Medicare beneficiary imaging resource consumption and measures of population economic status.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The 2013 CMS Geographic Variation Public Use File was used to identify county-level per capita Medicare fee-for-service imaging utilization and nationally standardized costs to the Medicare program. The County Health Rankings public data set was used to identify county-level measures of population economic status. Regional variation was assessed, and multivariate regressions were performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Imaging events per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries varied 1.8-fold (range, 2,723-4,843) at the state level and 5.3-fold (range, 1,228-6,455) at the county level. Per capita nationally standardized imaging costs to Medicare varied 4.2-fold (range, $84-$353) at the state level and 14.1-fold (range, $33-$471) at the county level. Within individual states, county-level utilization varied on average 2.0-fold (range, 1.1- to 3.1-fold), and costs varied 2.8-fold (range, 1.1- to 6.4-fold). For both large urban populations and small rural states, Medicare imaging resource consumption was heterogeneously variable at the county level. Adjusting for county-level gender, ethnicity, rural status, and population density, countywide unemployment rates showed strong independent positive associations with Medicare imaging events (β = 26.96) and costs (β = 4.37), whereas uninsured rates showed strong independent positive associations with Medicare imaging costs (β = 2.68).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medicare imaging utilization and costs both vary far more at the county than at the state level. Unfavorable measures of county-level population economic status in the non-Medicare population are independently associated with greater Medicare imaging resource consumption. Future efforts to optimize Medicare imaging use should consider the influence of local indigenous socioeconomic factors outside the scope of traditional beneficiary-focused policy initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2016.11.020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28291599/,economics
"The paper briefly discusses the importance of macro-economic policy in health sector financing. The ways in which monetary and fiscal policy (macro-economic policy) affect interest rates, price levels and aggregate output are presented. The main portion of the paper considers a variety of methods for public financing of health and development projects. These approaches are analyzed in light of distributional and efficiency considerations. One way of increasing health sector resources is through reallocation from other sectors of the economy. The potential for redistribution from the defense to the health service industry is briefly considered.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(86)90133-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3961549/,economics

"This article reviews the development of economic evaluation of health technologies in the UK and its impact on decision making. After a long period of limited impact from studies mainly carried out as academic exercises, the advent of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 1999 provided a transparent decision-making context where economic evaluation plays a central role. This article reviews some of the key characteristics about the way NICE works, for example, the way NICE has defined the form of analysis that it requires, reflecting its objective of maximising health gain (QALYs) from the predetermined and limited UK NHS budget. Two broad areas of widespread concern are noted. The first relates to the cost-effectiveness thresholds that NICE uses and the basis for them. The second is the patchy implementation of NICE guidance and the possible reasons for this. But even within the UK, NICE is the exception in making extensive and explicit use of economic evaluation and this article goes on to suggest that if there is to be a more widespread and consistent use of economic evaluation at both central and local levels, then health economists and others need to address three issues. The first is to be clear about what is the correct conceptual basis for determining the cost-effectiveness threshold and then to ensure that NICE has the empirical evidence to set it appropriately. The second is to recognise that even using the limited view of costs adopted by NICE, economic evaluations imply temporal and cross-service budgetary flexibility that the NHS locally does not in practice enjoy. The third issue is that with academic pressures for ever-increasing sophistication of 'state of the art' economic evaluation analysis, the NHS has more and more precise understanding of the cost effectiveness of just a few new technologies and little or no analysis of most. This limits the value of the former by reducing further the scope for appropriately disinvesting from cost-ineffective technologies to meet the additional costs of investing in cost-effective new ones. Whilst NICE stands out as an example of a context where high-quality economic evaluation plays a major role in decision making, the process is far from perfect and certainly is not representative of the use made of economic evaluation by the NHS as a whole. Health economists need to engage with the public and the health service to better understand their perspectives, rather than focusing on academic concerns relating to details of theory and analytical method.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200624110-00009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17067197/,economics
"Despite the increased interest in economic evaluations, there are difficulties in applying the results of such studies in practice. Therefore, the ""Research Agenda for Health Economic Evaluation"" (RAHEE) project was initiated, which aimed to improve the use of health economic evidence in practice for the 10 highest burden conditions in the European Union (including low back pain [LBP] and neck pain [NP]). This was done by undertaking literature mapping and convening an Expert Panel meeting, during which the literature mapping results were discussed and evidence gaps and methodological constraints were identified. The current paper is a part of the RAHEE project and aimed to identify economic evidence gaps and methodological constraints in the LBP and NP literature, in particular. The literature mapping revealed that economic evidence was unavailable for various commonly used LBP and NP treatments (e.g., injections, traction, and discography). Even if economic evidence was available, many treatments were only evaluated in a single study or studies for the same intervention were highly heterogeneous in terms of their patient population, control condition, follow-up duration, setting, and/or economic perspective. Up until now, this has prevented economic evaluation results from being statistically pooled in the LBP and NP literature, and strong conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of LBP and NP treatments can therefore not be made. The Expert Panel identified the need for further high-quality economic evaluations, especially on surgery versus conservative care and competing treatment options for chronic LBP. Handling of uncertainty and reporting quality were considered the most important methodological challenges.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.berh.2017.09.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29103555/,economics
"Objective/study design:
        
      
      The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the literature evaluating the costs associated with the management of adult chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two separate authors systematically searched eight commonly used medical databases. Included articles were categorized into seven domains: 1) overall healthcare cost (direct and indirect), 2) resource utilization, 3) medical management strategies, 4) overall procedure cost of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), 5) intraoperative technologies, 6) ESS litigation, and 7) CRS diagnostics. To maintain a common currency for comparison, all costs were converted to 2014 United States dollars (USD) using an inflation calculator in September 2014.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-four studies were identified for inclusion. The range for overall CRS-related healthcare costs was $6.9 to $9.9 billion 2014 USD per year. Indirect costs were estimated as $13 billion 2014 USD per year. Annual medication costs prior to ESS ranged between $1,547 and $2,700 2014 USD per patient, with a uniform reduction in costs after ESS. The overall US cost of outpatient ESS ranged from $8,200 to $10,500 2014 USD per case. The overall annual economic burden of CRS in the United States was estimated to be $22 billion 2014 USD (direct and indirect costs).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results of this systematic review have demonstrated substantial direct and indirect costs associated with the management of adult CRS.

"Birth weight manipulation has been documented in per-case hospital reimbursement systems, in which hospitals receive more money for otherwise equal newborns with birth weight just below compared to just above specific birth weight thresholds. As hospitals receive more money for cases with weight below the thresholds, having a (reported) weight below a threshold could benefit the newborn. Also, these reimbursement thresholds overlap with diagnostic thresholds that have been shown to affect the quantity and quality of care that newborns receive. Based on the universe of hospital births in Germany from the years 2005-2011, we investigate whether weight below reimbursement relevant thresholds triggers different quantity and quality of care. We find that this is not the case, suggesting that hospitals' financial incentives with respect to birth weight do not directly impact the care that newborns receive.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2018.01.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29627674/,economics
"Global guidelines for new technologies are based on cost and efficacy data from a limited number of trial locations. Country-level decision makers need to consider whether cost-effectiveness analysis used to inform global guidelines are sufficient for their situation or whether to use models that adjust cost-effectiveness results taking into account setting-specific epidemiological and cost heterogeneity. However, demand and supply constraints will also impact cost-effectiveness by influencing the standard of care and the use and implementation of any new technology. These constraints may also vary substantially by setting. We present two case studies of economic evaluations of the introduction of new diagnostics for malaria and tuberculosis control. These case studies are used to analyse how the scope of economic evaluations of each technology expanded to account for and then address demand and supply constraints over time. We use these case studies to inform a conceptual framework that can be used to explore the characteristics of intervention complexity and the influence of demand and supply constraints. Finally, we describe a number of feasible steps that researchers who wish to apply our framework in cost-effectiveness analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26786617/,economics

"Since the positive listing system for prescription drug reimbursement has been introduced in Korea, the number of pharmacoeconomic evaluation studies has increased. However it is not clear if the quality of pharmacoeconomic evaluation study has improved. Due to the lack of randomized clinical studies in Korean health care setting, Korean economic evaluation studies have typically integrated the local cost data and foreign clinical data. Therefore methodological issues can be raised in regard to data coherence and consistency. But the quality of data was not questiened and the potential bias has not been investigated yet. Even though changes in policy have encouraged the undertaking of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, there is few public-side funding for validation study of cost-effectiveness models and data. Several companies perform economic evaluation studies to be submitted on behalf of their own products, but do not want the study results to be disclosed to the academic community or public. To improve the present conduct of pharmacoeconomic evaluations in Korea, various funding sources need to be developed, and, like other multidisciplinary areas, the experts in different fields of study should collaborate to ensure the validity and credibility of pharmacoeconomic evaluations.",https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.2008.41.2.74,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18385546/,economics
"In this paper we estimate health plan price elasticities and financial switching gains for consumers over a 20-year period in which managed competition was introduced in the Dutch health insurance market. The period is characterized by a major health insurance reform in 2006 to provide health insurers with more incentives and tools to compete, and to provide consumers with a more differentiated choice of products. Prior to the reform, in the period 1995-2005, we find a low number of switchers, between 2 and 4% a year, modest average total switching gains of 2 million euros per year and short-term health plan price elasticities ranging from -0.1 to -0.4. The major reform in 2006 resulted in an all-time high switching rate of 18%, total switching gains of 130 million euros, and a high short-term price elasticity of -5.7. During 2007-2015 switching rates returned to lower levels, between 4 and 8% per year, with total switching gains in the order of 40 million euros per year on average. Total switching gains could have been 10 times higher if all consumers had switched to one of the cheapest plans. We find short-term price elasticities ranging between -0.9 and -2.2. Our estimations suggest substantial consumer inertia throughout the entire period, as we find degrees of choice persistence ranging from about 0.8 to 0.9.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-017-0876-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28243775/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      During the past decade German patients developed an increasing tendency to dental health tourism in countries outside the European Union. The present investigation aimed at evaluating both clinical and economic outcome of dental care in these countries with regard to German directive standards.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on physical examinations performed by the Medizinische Dienst der Krankenversicherung Rheinland-Pfalz in the context of reimbursement or regress requests after dental care in countries outside the European Union, an individual treatment concept was designed and its direct costs from the patient's perspective were estimated according to German standards. Furthermore, the clinical outcome was evaluated and treatment concepts for the correction of clinically relevant findings were simulated; the corresponding costs were estimated. A descriptive cost-cost analysis has been performed from the patient's perspective and a secondary one from the health service's perspective.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 60 examinations (january 2001 to october 2002) were analysed. 29 of these 60 patients showed clinically relevant findings affording post treatment correction, among which 23 treatment concepts significantly disagreed with German directive standards. From the 60 patients' perspective median costs of 942 euro; for treatment outside the EU versus hypothetical costs of 750 euro; for treatment in Germany were observed. In addition, the 29 patients with clinically relevant findings affording corrective treatment implied median costs of 1,383 euro;. From the health service perspective, median costs of 761 euro; could be avoided due to treatments outside the EU, whereas median costs of 1,220 euro; were simulated due to necessary corrective treatments.

"In many countries, including Thailand, there is an increasing impetus to use economic evaluation to allow more explicit and transparent healthcare priority setting. However, an important question for policy makers in low- and middle-income countries is whether it is appropriate and feasible to introduce economic evaluation data into healthcare priority-setting decisions. In addition to ethical, social and political issues, information supply challenges need to be addressed. This paper systematically reviewed the literature on economic evaluation of health technology in Thailand published between 1982 and 2005. Its aim was to analyse the quantity, quality and targeting of economic evaluation studies that can provide a framework for those conducting similar reviews in other settings. The review revealed that, although the number of publications reporting economic evaluations has increased significantly in recent years, serious attention needs to be given to the quality of reporting and analysis. Furthermore, there is an absence of economic evaluation publications for 15 of the top 20 major health problems in Thailand, indicating a poor distribution of research resources towards the determination of cost-effective interventions for diminishing the disease burden of certain major health problems. If economic evaluation is only useful for policy makers when performed correctly and reported accurately, these findings depict information barriers to using economic evaluation to assist health decision-making processes in Thailand.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200725060-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17523752/,economics
"Background and objective:
        
      
      Patient heterogeneity is the part of variability that can be explained by certain patient characteristics (e.g. age, disease stage). Population reimbursement decisions that acknowledge patient heterogeneity could potentially save money and increase population health. To date, however, economic evaluations pay only limited attention to patient heterogeneity. The objective of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge regarding patient heterogeneity within economic evaluation of healthcare programmes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review was performed to identify methodological papers on the topic of patient heterogeneity in economic evaluation. Data were obtained using a keyword search of the PubMed database and manual searches. Handbooks were also included. Relevant data were extracted regarding potential sources of patient heterogeneity, in which of the input parameters of an economic evaluation these occur, methods to acknowledge patient heterogeneity and specific concerns associated with this acknowledgement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 20 articles and five handbooks were included. The relevant sources of patient heterogeneity (demographics, preferences and clinical characteristics) and the input parameters where they occurred (baseline risk, treatment effect, health state utility and resource utilization) were combined in a framework. Methods were derived for the design, analysis and presentation phases of an economic evaluation. Concerns related mainly to the danger of false-positive results and equity issues.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      By systematically reviewing current knowledge regarding patient heterogeneity within economic evaluations of healthcare programmes, we provide guidance for future economic evaluations. Guidance is provided on which sources of patient heterogeneity to consider, how to acknowledge them in economic evaluation and potential concerns.

"Predicting the stock market has become an increasingly interesting research area for both researchers and investors, and many prediction models have been proposed. In these models, feature selection techniques are used to pre-process the raw data and remove noise. In this paper, a prediction model is constructed to forecast stock market behavior with the aid of independent component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and a support vector machine. First, two types of features are extracted from the historical closing prices and 39 technical variables obtained by independent component analysis. Second, a canonical correlation analysis method is utilized to combine the two types of features and extract intrinsic features to improve the performance of the prediction model. Finally, a support vector machine is applied to forecast the next day's closing price. The proposed model is applied to the Shanghai stock market index and the Dow Jones index, and experimental results show that the proposed model performs better in the area of prediction than other two similar models.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24971455/,economics
"In 2015 the British government announced a number of major tax reforms for individual landlords. To give landlords time to adjust, some of these tax measures are being introduced gradually from April 2017, with full effect in tax year 2020/21. The changes in taxation have received much media attention since there has been widespread belief that the new measures were sufficiently skewed against landlords that they could signal the end of the Buy-To-Let (BTL) investment era in the UK. This paper assesses the prospective performance of BTL investments in London from the investor's perspective, and examines the impact of incoming tax reforms using a novel Temporal Bayesian Network model. The model captures uncertainties of interest by simulating the impact of changing circumstances and the interventions available to an investor at various time-steps of a BTL investment portfolio. The simulation results suggest that the new tax reforms are likely to have a detrimental effect on net profits from rental income, and this hits risk-seeking investors who favour leverage much harder than risk-averse investors who do not seek to expand their property portfolio. The impact on net profits also poses substantial risks for lossmaking returns excluding capital gains, especially in the case of rising interest rates. While this makes it less desirable or even non-viable for some to continue being a landlord, based on the current status of all factors taken into consideration for simulation, investment prospects are still likely to remain good within a reasonable range of interest rate and capital growth rate variations. The results also suggest that the recent trend of property prices in London increasing faster than rents will not continue for much longer; either capital growth rates will have to decrease, rental growth rates will have to increase, or we shall observe a combination of the two events.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179297,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28654698/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      This article reviewed research conducted on economic evaluations of clinical pharmacy services (CPS) in China. We aimed to identify the types of CPS and the possible economic effects of these services and to hopefully provide some suggestions for designing future economic evaluations of pharmacy interventions in the region.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Systematic review.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Several English databases (PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database), Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and WanFang Data) and search engines (Google Scholar and BaiDu Scholar) were searched through December 2017.
    


          Eligibility criteria for selecting studies:
        
      
      Studies with an economic assessment of CPSs in China were included.
    


          Data extraction and synthesis:
        
      
      Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted the data, assessed the quality of the included studies and then qualitatively analysed the results.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty articles were included in the final analysis. Most studies were performed in hospitals and the intervention populations mainly included adults. The types of pharmaceutical services included antimicrobial management, chronic disease state management and multidimensional clinical pharmaceutical services. A positive economic benefit associated with CPS was noted in 80% (n=32) of these articles, showing that CPS were associated with cost savings and improved patient outcomes. However, only three studies were full economic evaluations, using the method of cost-effectiveness analysis.
    


          Conclusion:

With the expanding role of pharmacists in the healthcare sector, it is suggested that new pharmaceutical services be used in future studies and that high-quality full economic evaluations capturing both expenses and cost savings be conducted.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034862,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31911528/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In view of high out-of-pocket costs and low spending even for basic healthcare for the poor employed in the unorganized sector, policy makers in India have turned their attention to developing a financing mechanism for social health insurance with the desire to provide quality care to the poor and economically disadvantaged.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study aims to assess and determine the disease profile, treatment expenditure and willingness to pay for health insurance among rickshaw pullers in Delhi.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was conducted among 500 rickshaw pullers from five zones of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, taking a sample of 100 from each zone.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average cost of treatment was Rs.505 for outpatient and Rs. 3200 for inpatient care. To finance the treatment expenditure, 27.5% of the respondents spent from their household savings, and 43% had to borrow funds. Any ""spell of sickness"" and ""total expenditure on acute illness"" were significantly (p < 0.01) associated with the willingness to pay for health insurance. Overall, the majority (83%) of participants were willing to pay for health insurance.

"French private physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis and nearly all of them are under contract to the Social Security, which refunds part of the medical fee to the whole population. Previously the prices of medical services were fixed, but since 1980, a new option has been possible: a doctor can choose to fix the price of his services freely, provided he pays a higher social insurance contribution. But the amount refunded by Social Security does not vary, so that the consumer has to bear the extra charge. Our purpose here is to identify the factors that influence the physician's option. In Section 2, we define a model of the private physician's economic behaviour, of the classic income-leisure type. In Section 3, empirical tests are performed on a sample of observations in 95 'départements', gathering information about private GPs on the one hand, and the whole population on the other. According to our results, GPs' decisions depend on characteristics of both supply of and demand for GPs' services. One of our conclusions is that GPs seem to make up for low activity levels with higher prices, on condition the income of their practice allows it.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(91)90070-s,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1776035/,economics

The arguments for and against such cuts in response to economic recession are complex, but if public health professionals are to engage in debates about future public spending, they should be informed by relevant evidence. In this perspective, we note that opinions among politicians and economists about how to respond to economic downturns are divided, while other EU countries, many with greater levels of debt than the UK, are protecting public expenditure unless required to do so by the International Monetary Fund.

"Purpose:
        
      
      The activity-based costing method was used to compute radiotherapy costs. This report describes the model developed, the calculated costs, and possible applications for the Leuven radiotherapy department.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      Activity-based costing is an advanced cost calculation technique that allocates resource costs to products based on activity consumption. In the Leuven model, a complex allocation principle with a large diversity of cost drivers was avoided by introducing an extra allocation step between activity groups and activities. A straightforward principle of time consumption, weighed by some factors of treatment complexity, was used. The model was developed in an iterative way, progressively defining the constituting components (costs, activities, products, and cost drivers).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Radiotherapy costs are predominantly determined by personnel and equipment cost. Treatment-related activities consume the greatest proportion of the resource costs, with treatment delivery the most important component. This translates into products that have a prolonged total or daily treatment time being the most costly. The model was also used to illustrate the impact of changes in resource costs and in practice patterns.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The presented activity-based costing model is a practical tool to evaluate the actual cost structure of a radiotherapy department and to evaluate possible resource or practice changes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0360-3016(03)00579-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12957266/,economics
"This paper focuses on the switching behaviour of enrolees in the Swiss basic health insurance system. Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers in basic insurance, there is limited evidence of premium convergence within cantons. This indicates that competition has not been effective so far, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of supplementary insurance. We use survey data on health plan choice (a sample of 1943 individuals whose switching behaviours were observed between 1997 and 2000) as well as administrative data relative to all insurance companies that operated in the 26 Swiss cantons between 1996 and 2005. The decision to switch and the decision to subscribe to a supplementary contract are jointly estimated.Our findings show that holding a supplementary insurance contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. However, there is no negative impact of supplementary insurance on switching when the individual assesses his/her health as 'very good'. Our results give empirical support to one possible mechanism through which supplementary insurance might influence switching decisions: given that subscribing to basic and supplementary contracts with two different insurers may induce some administrative costs for the subscriber, holding supplementary insurance acts as a barrier to switch if customers who consider themselves 'bad risks' also believe that insurers reject applications for supplementary insurance on these grounds. In comparison with previous research, our main contribution is to offer a possible explanation for consumer inertia. Our analysis illustrates how consumer choice for one's basic health plan interacts with the decision to subscribe to supplementary insurance.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1441,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19267356/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      If clearly indicated and implemented, augmentations of vertebral bodies with cement are standardized, safe and low-risk procedures. However, the multiplicity of providers and systems are today more varied than ever. At present, the systems differ starkly from one another not only in specifications, possible applications and extensions of indications, but they are also extremely variable in price. Publications have shown that in times of medical-economic change, vertebral augmentations make sense not only medically, but also in terms of economics and the national economy. Our analysis targets the question of how insurance costs with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty affect profit margins per G-DRG (German Diagnosis Related Groups) in consideration of the different system approaches of the providers.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      After reviewing the literature, extremely varied, minimally invasive augmentation methods and techniques for treating vertebral body fractures were identified and classified. These were grouped based also [sic: on] OPS and possibly further subdivisions. Material costs were gathered based on average price quotations of different providers and techniques and aligned with those from the literature. The inpatient costs per day were estimated as a lump sum according to published information, since our analysis was interested in less detailed process costs as these are difficult to transfer to other clinics due to parameters being unique to each facility. The G-DRGs concerned were likewise determined according to the case-based lump sum catalogue from 2012. Based on this, the material costs as well as the daily costs per day of inpatient stay according to the average length of stay per G-DRG were subtracted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Vertebral augmentation methods are classified into vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty according to OPS. In addition, according to current literature, a further subdivision of kyphoplasty into substance-conserving or direct cement injection techniques and substance-destroying or indirect cement injection techniques took place. The procedures involve material costs between 10-40 % of G-DRG revenue. The profit margin of vertebral augmentation ranges from approx. 4100 € to approx. 11 400 €. The calculative costs of the inpatient care per day amount to 488.86 €. Based on the average lengths of stay per G-DRG (7.8-12.6 days) for 2012 determined by the InEK (Institut für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus [Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System]), the financial costs of inpatient care were calculated between 3813.11 € and 6159.65 €. A shortfall of -197.53 € for the treatment of a vertebral body resulted for the vertebroplasty. This shortfall increases with the treatment of three vertebral bodies and a PCCL = 4 to -466.30 €. The indirect cement injection techniques accounted for a positive profit margin of 196.03 € for the treatment of a vertebra. Due to high material costs, however, this dips into the negative in the amount of -1227.70 € for two vertebrae and increases to -2522.50 € for the treatment of three vertebral bodies. In contrast, the multilevel care in substance-preserving kyphoplasty techniques show a positive profit margin of 72.30 € for the treatment of two vertebrae and 577.50 € for the treatment of three vertebrae.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Against the background of the increasing economization of the health care system, it should be emphasized once more that the decision for a therapy or a system based on medical reasons should only be made by the treating physician. The vertebroplasty could not be performed at a profit in our analysis, despite comparatively low material costs. A shortfall between -197.53 € and -466.30 € was determined. The comparatively higher material costs of the kyphoplasty make comparisons important. The results of our investigation also show that supposedly inexpensive purchases of materials are not automatically a favorable alternative. In addition, the kyphoplasty techniques currently available on the market are not necessarily comparable. According to our investigation, profits of between 196.03 € and 577.50 € are to be realized in the selection of vertebral augmentation systems based on purely economic considerations. The results of our analysis show that the pure comparison of figures of the average material costs of a G-DRG and the material price distort the picture. A calculation of the profit margin on the basis of costs of care per vertebral body is more definitive.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1315287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076753/,economics
"Purchasers and providers in the National Health Service (NHS) are now required to move from annual contracting cycles to longer-term contracts. The benefits are expected to include more efficient investment and improved sharing of financial risk. This paper argues that the economic analysis of longer-term contracts has assumed implicitly that agents operate in the private sector. Once the constraints of the public sector are introduced, the apparent economic benefits of longer-term contracts become doubtful. The paper explores these issues using evidence collected from analysis of the contracts of a sample of Health Authorities and from semi-structured interviews with individuals involved in the contracting process. We conclude that with the property rights and financial structure of the public sector, the move from short- to long-term contracts is unlikely to produce the improvements in performance expected by the government.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199912)8:8<709::aid-hec482>3.0.co;2-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10590472/,economics

"There is a requirement for economic evaluation of health technologies seeking public funding across Europe. Changes to the organisation and delivery of health services, including changes to health policy, are not covered by such appraisals. These changes also have consequences for National Health Service (NHS) funds, yet undergo no mandatory cost-effectiveness assessment. The focus on health technologies may have occurred because larger-scale service changes pose more complex challenges to evaluators. This paper discusses the principal challenges faced when performing economic evaluations of changes to the organisation and delivery of health services and provides recommendations for overcoming them. The five principal challenges identified are as follows: undertaking ex-ante evaluation; evaluating impacts in terms of quality-adjusted life years; assessing costs and opportunity costs; accounting for spillover effects; and generalisability. Of these challenges, methods for estimating the impact on costs and quality-adjusted life years are those most in need of development. Methods are available for ex-ante evaluation, assessing opportunity costs and examining generalisability. However, these are rarely applied in practice. The general principles of assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions should be applied to all NHS spending, not just that involving health technologies. Advancements in this area have the potential to improve the allocation of scarce NHS resources.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133118000063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29673412/,economics

"Psychiatric problems are common in general medical practice and strongly influence utilization of medical care. Although several studies have demonstrated the positive clinical and financial impact of psychiatric interventions for medical patients, historic and economic forces have tended to maintain the separation of the primary health and mental health components of care. The author discusses the financial incentives that influence the success or failure of initiatives to integrate mental health care and primary care. Most models for financing care that use fee-for-service, carve-out, or capitated arrangements have done little to encourage collaborative treatment planning and coordination of care or have created conditions that work against such integration. True financial incentives for integration of psychiatric and primary health care are provided only by a shared-risk model of capitation-a model that has long existed in staff-model health maintenance organizations. This model increases motivation to lower overall utilization of care, improve patients' overall health status, and search for more effective models of care.",https://doi.org/10.1176/ps.50.8.1071,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10445657/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      For palliation of patients with malignant obstructive jaundice, expansile metal stents provide longer patency than plastic stents but are more expensive. The optimal cost-effective strategy has not been established. Our aim was to compare the relative costs of 3 strategies: (1) plastic stent, with exchange on occlusion; (2) metal stent initially, with coaxial plastic stent insertion in the event of occlusion; or (3) plastic stent initially, with metal stent exchange in the event of occlusion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A decision analysis model was created using DATA 2.6 software to assess the relative costs of the three strategies. Values for variables including the probabilities of reintervention and patient survival were obtained from published data. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursements of hospital charges, and the model was evaluated from the perspective of a third-party payer. One-way and two-way sensitivity analysis of the variables was performed over a wide range.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The outcome is highly sensitive to the ratio of metal stent cost relative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography cost (cost ratio M:ERCP) and to the length of survival of the patient. The most economical strategies were (2), (3) and (1) for M:ERCP cost ratios of <0.5, 0.5 to 0.7, and >0.7, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The choice of stent should be guided by the relative local costs of ERCP and metal stents and by the prognosis of the patient. At current metal stent costs and Medicare reimbursement rates, initial placement of a plastic stent, followed by metal stent placement at first occlusion in longer survivors, is an economical option. If metal stent cost is less than half of ERCP cost, then initial insertion of a metal stent would be most economical. Use of plastic stents is preferable for patients surviving less than 4 months, whereas metal stents are more economical for patients with longer survival.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0016-5107(99)70044-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10202060/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      to analyze the cost of a self-owned network maintained by a Brazilian health insurance provider as compared to the price charged by accredited service providers, so as to identify whether or not the self-owned network is economically advantageous.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      for this exploratory study, the company's management reports were reviewed. The cost associated with the self-owned network was calculated based on medical and dental office visits and diagnostic/laboratory tests performed at one of the company's most representative facilities. The costs associated with third parties were derived from price tables used by the accredited network for the same services analyzed in the self-owned network. The full-cost method was used for cost quantification. Costs are presented as absolute values (in R$) and percent comparisons between self-owned network costs versus accredited network costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      overall, the self-owned network was advantageous for medical and dental consultations as well as diagnostic and laboratory tests. Pediatric and labor medicine consultations and x-rays were less costly in the accredited network.

"This article provides an overview of the characteristics and problems of the economic evaluation of mental health care. At first, the problems and methods of measuring direct and indirect costs of mental illness are discussed using cost of illness studies for depression and schizophrenia from the literature as examples. It is shown that, due to methodological problems of measuring costs of the wide range of mental health services as well as productivity losses, various cost of illness studies rendered very different results. Thereafter, the measurement of effects in the economic evaluation of mental health services is discussed whereby the problems of measuring quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are addressed in particular. Despite the subjectivity of symptoms, preference-based valuation of health-related quality of life has rarely been attempted in psychiatric patients. Finally, frequent flaws of published cost-effectiveness analyses of mental health care are presented. These flaws make the interpretation and comparison of study results difficult.

"Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons for patients to seek medical care. Chronic pain results in substantial economic losses and remains one of the most costly conditions in modern western society. In 1991, costs were estimated to be approximately $65 billion annually, comparable to the cost of treating diabetes. Persistent chronic pain and the use of advanced interventional and pharmacological treatments often leads to complex social and psychological maladaptations, health care overutilization, as well as many other substantial direct and indirect costs. Thus, the proper treatment of chronic pain involves intense multidisciplinary management, including pharmacological, behavioral, and psychological interventions. Few studies have assessed the total economic cost of chronic pain. However, many of the chronic pain treatments do not alleviate pain symptoms for most patients and lead to unsuccessful application of resources. The economic consequences of inadequately treated chronic pain translates into lost work days, overutilization of health care resources (excess hospitalizations, and surgical procedures and inappropriate medications) and other out-of-pocket patient expenses. Increasing emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain places more importance on the need for efficient and coordinated management of patient with chronic pain. The management of chronic pain is remarkably complex and resource intensive. Therefore, a clear need exists for intensive pharmacoeconomic investigations, specifically evaluating costs related to chronic pain and the associated treatment modalities. Additionally, evaluation of the costs related to chronic pain would measure the economic burden of chronic pain, including an estimate of the amount that could potentially be saved if chronic pain patients are optimally managed.",https://doi.org/10.3109/15360281003713826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20504139/,economics

In this study, we use a newly developed database tracking common ownership over a period of nearly two decades to compare chain-adjusted and unadjusted measures of competition at the county and 25 km fixed-radius levels and explore how the differences would affect the assessment of local market structure. On average, the chain-adjusted Herfindahl-Hirschman Indexes (HHIs) are about 0.02 higher than the unadjusted HHIs. Each year, about 20% to 22% of the counties would appear more concentrated when recalculating HHIs accounting for common ownership.

"The relationship between renewable energy consumption (REC), foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, economic growth, and their resulting impact on CO2 emissions is widely discussed area in energy and environmental literature; however, there is an unseen literature on moderation and mediation effect of per capita income and FDI inflows with the renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions in developing countries like Pakistan, which is being evaluated in this study by using a consistent time series data for a period of 1975-2016. The results show that economic growth and FDI inflows both increase CO2 emissions, while REC substantially decreases CO2 emissions during the study time period. The results do not support the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for per capita income (and FDI inflows) and per capita CO2 emissions in a country. The results supported 'pollution haven hypothesis' where FDI inflows damage the natural flora of the country. By inclusion of moderation and mediation effect of per capita income and FDI inflows with the REC on CO2 emissions averted the positive impact of REC, and converted into negative externality, where environmental sustainability agenda is compromised by lower environmental regulations and unsustainable production techniques that increase country's economic growth.

"It is common in cost-effectiveness analyses of health care to only include health care costs, with the argument that some fictive 'health care budget' should be used to maximize the health effects. This paper provides a criticism of the 'health care budget' approach to cost-effectiveness analysis of health care. It is argued that the approach is ad hoc and lacks theoretical foundation. The approach is also inconsistent with using a fixed budget as the decision rule for cost-effectiveness analysis. That is the case unless only costs that fall into a single annual actual budget are included in the analysis, which would mean that any cost paid by the patients should be excluded as well as any future cost changes and all costs that fall on other budgets. Furthermore the prices facing the budget holder should be used, rather than opportunity costs. It is concluded that the 'health care budget' perspective should be abandoned and the societal perspective reinstated in economic evaluation of health care.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(94)00677-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10143700/,economics
"To successfully achieve biodiversity conservation, the amount of ecosystem structure available for economic production must be determined by, and subject to, conservation needs. As such, the scale of economic systems must remain within the limits imposed by the need to preserve critical ecosystems and the regenerative and waste assimilative capacities of the ecosphere. These limits are determined by biophysical criteria, yet macroeconomics involves the use of economic instruments designed to meet economic criteria that have no capacity to achieve biophysically based targets. Macroeconomic policy cannot, therefore, directly solve the biodiversity erosion crisis. Nevertheless, good macroeconomic policy is still important given that bad macroeconomy policy is likely to reduce human well-being and increase the likelihood of social upheaval that could undermine conservation efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01092.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19076875/,economics

Using a sample of non-financial companies from 10 countries over a period leading to the recent global financial crisis, we documented that the corporate governance has a nonlinear (inverted U-shape) impact on the companies' investment risk, meaning that the investment risk is increasing up to a level of corporate governance of 0.61 (as measured by our comprehensive index), while at higher levels of corporate governance the investment risk is decreasing. For the models of sales growth and assets growth it is shown that predicted investment risk has a positive effect on firms' growth measures. Moreover, the two growth models are not moving independently and a shock to one of the growth measures (sales or assets) affects the other growth measure in the same direction. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of financial crisis on both the growth measures and the risk measure. The effect of financial crisis was captured in both measures in 2009, with higher impact on the growth of sales.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32017781/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Health insurers are increasingly making use of risk-sharing agreements with drug manufacturers to manage uncertainties regarding the costs and effectiveness of new drugs. Several risk-sharing models exist including those based on sales volume, achievement of clinical thresholds, and achievement of cost-effectiveness thresholds. The objective of this article is to compare two risk-sharing arrangements and to investigate conditions under which each is preferable from the perspective of the payer and the manufacturer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We develop two two-period models to compare two risk-sharing arrangements between a payer and a drug manufacturer in which there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the new drug. In the first risk-sharing agreement, the drug is listed on a formulary in the first period but delisted in the second period if the net monetary benefit in the first period is negative. In the second risk-sharing agreement, the manufacturer pays a rebate in each period if the net monetary benefit in that period is negative.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We show that the relative performance of the two arrangements depends on several factors and that neither arrangement is always preferred. Additionally, we are able to identify situations in which a payer and a manufacturer would prefer the same plan and other situations in which the two parties would disagree on which plan was most desirable.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Because neither risk-sharing arrangement is always preferred, payers and manufacturers must carefully consider the characteristics of their individual situation when entering into such contracts.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00510.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19490563/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Malaysia is an upper-middle income country with a tax-based health financing system. Health care is relatively affordable, and safety nets are provided for the needy. The objectives of this study were to determine the out-of-pocket health spending, proportion of catastrophic health spending (out-of-pocket spending >40% of non-food expenditure), economic hardship and financial coping strategies among patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in Malaysia under the present health financing system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Heart Institute of Malaysia involving 503 patients who were hospitalized during the year prior to the survey.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean annual out-of-pocket health spending for IHD was MYR3045 (at the time US$761). Almost 16% (79/503) suffered from catastrophic health spending (out-of-pocket health spending ≥40% of household non-food expenditures), 29.2% (147/503) were unable to pay for medical bills, 25.0% (126/503) withdrew savings to help meet living expenses, 16.5% (83/503) reduced their monthly food consumption, 12.5% (63/503) were unable to pay utility bills and 9.0% (45/503) borrowed money to help meet living expenses.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, the economic impact of IHD on patients in Malaysia was considerable and the prospect of economic hardship likely to persist over the years due to the long-standing nature of IHD. The findings highlight the need to evaluate the present health financing system in Malaysia and to expand its safety net coverage for vulnerable patients.",https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihw054,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28028130/,economics
"Incorporation of ecological considerations in decision-making is essential for sustainable development, but is hindered by inadequate appreciation of the role of ecosystems, and lack of scientifically rigorous techniques for including their contribution. This paper develops a novel thermodynamic accounting framework for including the contribution of natural capital via thermodynamic input-output analysis. This framework is applied to the 1992 US economy comprising 91 industry sectors, resulting in delineation of the myriad ways in which sectors of the US economy rely on ecosystem products and services. The contribution of ecosystems is represented via the concept of ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC), which is related to emergy analysis but avoids any of its controversial assumptions and claims. The use of thermodynamics permits representation of all kinds of inputs and outputs in consistent units, facilitating the definition of aggregate metrics. Total ECEC requirement indicates the extent to which each economic sector relies directly and indirectly on ecological inputs. The ECEC/money ratio indicates the relative monetary versus ecological throughputs in each sector, and indicates the relationship between the thermodynamic work needed to produce a product or service and the corresponding economic activity. This ratio is found to decrease along economic supply chains, indicating industries that are higher up in the economic food chain price ecosystem contribution more than the basic infrastructure industries such as mining and manufacturing. The ratio of CEC with and without inclusion of ecosystems indicates the extent to which conventional thermoeconomic analysis underestimates the contribution of ecosystems. Such ratios, made available for the first time, provide unique insight into the importance of natural capital, and are especially useful in hybrid thermodynamic life cycle analysis of industrial systems. The approach, data compiled in this work, and the resulting insight provide a more ecologically conscious tool for environmental decision-making, and has potential applications at micro as well as macro scales.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es035367t,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15487791/,economics
"The department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses a global budgeting process to allocate congressionally appropriated resources to provide medical care to veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has developed this process to accommodate the effects of changes in pure inflation, workload, and cost per unit of work in forecasting operating dollars required for facility global budgets. In 1990, VA began shifting to a new method of allocating its global budget called Resource Planning and Management (RPM), based on a capitated system. Facilities receive resources according to their unit costs and the number and type of patients they are expected to serve. A key characteristic of any global budgeting information system is flexibility. The VA information system accesses the portion of each patients's care that is provided at every facility and aggregates this information across all facilities to create a single prorated patient record; the system reconstructs prior years of data into the new patient-centered format to forecast workload. No other health care system in the United States pays for and directly provides such a diverse set of services for such a large population as does VA.

"""Control"" of health care costs is often portrayed as a struggle between external, ""natural"" forces pushing costs up and individuals, groups, and societies trying to resist the inevitable. This picture is false. Control includes strenuous efforts by some to raise costs, and by others to resist those increases, and/or to transfer costs to someone else. But all such forces originate in the purposes and interests of individuals and groups. Health care cost control is a struggle among conflicting interests over the priorities of a society, and claims of ""inevitability"" are simply part of the political rhetoric of that struggle. International experience supports certain conclusions. First, there is no basis for the claim that limits on expenditure growth must threaten the health of (some members of) a society. Second, there is a substantial variety of experience with cost control. Failure in the United States is often presented as evidence of the impossibility of control, but most other countries have succeeded. Finally, control requires the direct confrontation of interests, with substantial build-up of stress. Advocates of expansion are more successful if they can transform compressive forces into efforts to shift the burden onto someone else. Pressures from providers in every country for ""privatization"" and/or payment by users reflect this recognition of economic interest.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-15-1-101,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2108199/,economics

"Ice cream has been manufactured commercially in the United States since the middle of the 19th century. Ice cream and frozen dessert products comprise an important and relatively stable component of the United States dairy industry. As with many other dairy products, ice cream is differentiated in several dimensions. A censored translog demand system model was employed to analyze purchases of 3 ice cream product categories. The objective of this study was to determine the effect that changes in retail prices and consumer income have on at-home ice cream consumption. The analysis was based on Nielsen 2005 home scan retail data and used marital status, age, race, education, female employment status, and location in the estimations of aggregate demand elasticities. Results revealed that price and consumer income were the main determinants of demand for ice cream products. Calculated own-price elasticities indicated relatively elastic responses by consumers for all categories except for compensated bulk ice cream. All expenditure elasticities were inelastic except for bulk ice cream, and most of the ice cream categories were substitutes. Ongoing efforts to examine consumer demand for these products will assist milk producers, dairy processors and manufacturers, and dairy marketers as they face changing consumer responses to food and diet issues.",https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19923626/,economics
"Algal biofuels are becoming more economically competitive due to technological advances and government subsidies offering tax benefits and lower cost financing. These factors are linked, however, as the value of technical advances is affected by modeling assumptions regarding the growth conditions, process design, and financing of the production facility into which novel techniques are incorporated. Two such techniques, related to algal growth and dewatering, are evaluated in representative operating and financing scenarios using an integrated techno-economic model. Results suggest that these techniques can be valuable under specified conditions, but also that investment subsidies influence cost competitive facility design by incentivizing development of more capital intensive facilities (e.g., favoring hydrothermal liquefaction over transesterification-based facilities). Evaluating novel techniques under a variety of operational and financial scenarios highlights the set of site-specific conditions in which technical advances are most valuable, while also demonstrating the influence of subsidies linked to capital intensity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.08.050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27584903/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Pharmaceutical products are an important component of expenditure on public health insurance in the Federal Republic of Germany. For years, German policy makers have regulated public pharmacies in order to limit the increase in costs. One reform has followed another, main objective being to increase competition in the pharmacy market. It is generally assumed that an increase in competition would reduce healthcare costs. However, there is a lack of empirical proof of a stronger orientation of German public pharmacies towards competition thus far.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This paper analyses the self-perceptions of owners of German public pharmacies and their orientation towards competition in the pharmacy markets. It is based on a cross-sectional survey (N = 289) and distinguishes between successful and less successful pharmacies, the location of the pharmacies (e.g. West German States and East German States) and the gender of the pharmacy owner. The data are analysed descriptively by survey items and employing bivariate and structural equation modelling.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The analysis reveals that the majority of owners of public pharmacies in Germany do not currently perceive very strong competitive pressure in the market. However, the innovativeness of the pharmacist is confirmed as most relevant for net revenue development and the profit margin. Some differences occur between regions, e.g. public pharmacies in West Germany have a significantly higher profit margin.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study provides evidence that the German healthcare reforms aimed at increasing the competition between public pharmacies in Germany have not been completely successful. Many owners of public pharmacies disregard instruments of active customer-orientated management (such as customer loyalty or an offensive position and economies of scale), which could give them a competitive advantage. However, it is clear that those pharmacists who strive for systematic and innovative management and adopt an offensive and competitive stance are quite successful. Thus, pharmacists should change their attitude and develop a more professional business model.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-13-407,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24112461/,economics
"Public and scientific discussion on the effects of an aging population is often biased: aging is primarily seen as an economic burden. Increasing contribution rates in pension schemes, health and long-term care insurance are highlighted. This paper tries to provide a more balanced view. The distinction between a cross-sectional and a longitudinal view already gives different information on distributional effects. Labeling older people as ""economically inactive"" is a much too narrow perspective focused on the activity on the labor market only. Other types of work are neglected such as caring for children or frail elderly as well as economic activities from wealth, consumption as well as paying taxes to finance public expenditure. The approach of ""generational accounting"" is also narrow, focusing on public expenditure, social insurance contributions and only some types of taxes, but not dealing with private, especially intrafamily transfers. In economic terms, a comprehensive approach is needed regarding the effect of institutions and measures on the economic situation of cohorts. The role of investment in human capital is mentioned as a decisive factor for productivity in a country. Further education and retraining of older workers is one important element. An integrative approach dealing with the different fields of activities is needed when analyzing the intergenerational as well as the intragenerational distribution. This requires an elaborated and differentiated reporting of distributional effects.

"Although economic theory indicates that it should not be necessary to intervene in the generic drug market through price regulation, most EU countries intervene in this market, both by regulating the maximum sale price of generics (price cap) and by setting the maximum reimbursement rate, especially by means of reference pricing systems. We analyse current knowledge of the impact of direct price-cap regulation of generic drugs and the implementation of systems regulating the reimbursement rate, particularly through reference pricing and similar tools, on dynamic price competition between generic competitors in Europe. A literature search was carried out in the EconLit and PubMed databases, and on Google Scholar. The search included papers published in English or Spanish between January 2000 and July 2009. Inclusion criteria included that studies had to present empirical results of a quantitative nature for EU countries of the impact of price capping and/or regulation of the reimbursement rate (reference pricing or similar systems) on price dynamics, corresponding to pharmacy sales, in the generic drug market. The available evidence indicates that price-cap regulation leads to a levelling off of generic prices at a higher level than would occur in the absence of this regulation. Reference pricing systems cause an obvious and almost compulsory reduction in the consumer price of all pharmaceuticals subject to this system, to a varying degree in different countries and periods, the reduction being greater for originator-branded drugs than for generics. In several countries with a reference pricing system, it was observed that generics with a consumer price lower than the reference price do not undergo price reductions until the reference price is reduced, even when there are other lower-priced generics on the market (absence of price competition below the reference price). Beyond the price reduction forced by the price-cap and/or reference pricing regulation itself, the entry of new generic competitors is useful for lowering the real transaction price of purchases made by pharmacies (dynamic price competition at ex-factory level), although this effect is weaker or non-significant for official ex-factory prices and consumer prices in some countries. When maximum reimbursement systems such as reference pricing or similar types are applied, pharmacies are seen to receive large discounts on the price they pay for the pharmaceuticals, although these discounts are not transferred to the consumer price. The percentage discount offered to pharmacies in a country that uses a price-cap system combined with reference pricing is positively and significantly related to the number of generic competitors in the market for the pharmaceutical (dynamic price competition at ex-factory level).",https://doi.org/10.2165/11535360-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515079/,economics

"For at least two decades, there has been an intense debate on whether and how to include the value of lost productivity in economic evaluations. This debate is often reflected in pharmacoeconomic guidelines, which have been developed to indicate the methods and requirements for the design, execution, and reporting of economic evaluations in a particular country.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To examine what various national pharmacoeconomic guidelines recommend regarding the identification, measurement, and valuation of lost productivity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      First, the theoretical framework on how lost productivity can be identified, measured, and valued is described. Second, a summary sheet has been used to identify various pharmacoeconomic guidelines recommendations regarding the value of lost productivity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-two of the 30 guidelines identified recommend performing economic evaluations using the societal perspective. Nevertheless, even if the societal perspective is recommended, it is not always clear how the value of lost productivity should be taken into account. Most guidelines recommend including the costs of absenteeism from paid and/or unpaid work. In addition, although no agreement exists on how lost productivity should be valued, none of the guidelines recommended using the US panel approach for the valuation of lost productivity.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The different recommendations hinder international transferability of the value of lost productivity. This difficulty is mainly caused by different recommendations regarding identification and valuation. These differences result from the debate and lack of consensus on including the value of lost productivity losses in economic evaluations. It will become easier to transfer data across jurisdictions if all data are reported transparently.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00699.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20712601/,economics
"Biosimilar medicines have shown similarity with the originator biologic and offer a similar clinical outcome generally at a lower cost. This paper identifies benefits of off-patent biologics and biosimilars, and illustrates these benefits with empirical data from Europe. We provide a narrative review of published literature on values and benefits of biosimilars in Europe. The results describe cost savings as the key driver stemming from the lower price of biosimilars, than that of originator products, and from price competition between biosimilar(s), originator, and next-generation products. Cost savings may then translate into a number of other associated benefits. The lower price of biosimilars and similar effectiveness to the originator biologics improve cost effectiveness, implying that reimbursement can be granted or extended to other patient groups, or that the biologic therapy can be moved to an earlier line of treatment. Cost savings from biosimilars can be used to increase patient access to therapy or to increase the number of healthcare professionals. Finally, competition between off-patent biologics and biosimilars may stimulate an innovation in the formulation and development of next-generation biologics. Our paper illustrates that the benefit of off-patent biologics and biosimilars is not restricted to cost savings, but that these medicines may contribute to an expansion of medical treatment options for patients, hence concomitantly contributing to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system. This review provides a broader view for clinical and economic decision makers and healthcare professionals on the added benefits of off-patent biologics and their use in clinical practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-019-00395-w,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31792843/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Opportunity cost is the potential gain or loss when a person chooses to perform an activity over its next best alternative. With respect to surgery, opportunity cost can occur if a less efficient technology uses more operating time than its next best alternative. This additional operating time could be used in a productive way that, when economically valued, adds a ""cost"" to the less efficient technology. Although fundamental to the economist's view of costs and widely used in economic assessments, opportunity cost analysis is infrequently used in economic evaluation of surgical technology. Previous cost comparison studies in the surgical literature have not addressed opportunity cost when estimating the efficiency of competing technologies. With increasing healthcare costs and new technologic advancements in surgery, a surgeon's ability to understand opportunity cost and apply it when choosing between two comparable technologies is essential. Our objective is to present a system to estimate the opportunity cost for given surgical specialties and present a model to demonstrate its principle.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To demonstrate the principle of opportunity cost, our model used a hypothetical scenario comparing two clinically equivalent technologies that differed in that the use of one device (Device A) extended operating time in a hypothetical procedure by 30 minutes compared to its competitor device (Device B). How this extra operating time could potentially be used was then valued using the opportunity cost calculated by our study design. Our study design included 5 surgical procedures from 5 surgical specialties that were elective, profitable, high-volume (performed more than 100 times per year), and had a duration of less than 240 minutes. The data were taken from a university hospital setting in 2007 and included procedure volume, profit margin, and duration. The outcome measure was opportunity cost, which was estimated by dividing the selected procedure's profit margin by its duration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Surgical specialty results are presented in the accompanying Tables. Otolaryngology has the highest opportunity cost at $38/min. This cost was calculated by using myringotomy as the procedure that was elective, short in duration, performed in high volume, and provided the highest profit margin. By applying our model, the otolaryngology surgeon using the less efficient Device A to perform a hypothetical procedure would incur an opportunity cost of $1,140 ($38/min x 30 min). This is because he could have performed additional myringotomy procedures in the time saved had he instead used the more efficient Device B in his hypothetical cases. General surgery has the lowest opportunity cost at $9/min; laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was the procedure used for its calculation. Under the same model, the general surgeon using Device A would incur an opportunity cost of $270 ($9/min x 30 min). This is because the general surgeon could have performed additional laparoscopic femoral/hernia repairs had she used the more efficient Device B in her hypothetical cases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In acknowledging opportunity cost, a surgeon can more accurately compare the efficiency of competing surgical devices. This comparison is carried out by estimating and applying a dollar amount to the potential utility of time created by the use of the less efficient device.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2009.03.027,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19541006/,economics

"With the introduction of the Prospective Payment System, hospital accountants' role changed from reimbursement maximizers to an important role in decision making. Faced with increased competition, many hospitals are installing financial controls. Many hospitals are engaging in promotion and health awareness campaigns and expanding their services to stabilize income and reduce the effects of a changing environment. Thus, hospitals operate in a more competitive environment with much uncertainty. When faced with uncertainty, organizations often believe that they must convince society that their existence is legitimate. Increasing specialization and organizational complexity in healthcare professions have made the expert important. Experts, such as the role assumed by hospital accountants, maintain power because the organization depends on them for their special skills and information. Scarce resources coupled with uncertainty move hospital accountants as experts into the power equation in the changing control of the U.S. healthcare system. Since accountants often serve as monitors of scarce resources, information about the resource allocation directly affects the distribution of power.

"The global economic and financial crisis is having and impact on the Italian healthcare system which is undergoing a devolution process from the central government to regions and where about one third of the regional governments (mainly in the central and southern part of the country) are facing large financial deficits. The paper briefly describes the current macro scenario and the main responses taken to face the crisis and highlights the downside risks of introducing ""linear"" cuts in the allocation of resources. While justified by the risk of a national debt default, present fiscal policies might increase inequalities in access to care, deteriorate overall health indicators and population wellbeing, and sharpen existing difference in the quality of care between regions. Preliminary evidence shows that the crisis is affecting the quality of nutrition and the incidence of psychiatric disorders. During this difficult financial situation Italy is also facing the risk of a major reduction in investments for preventive medicine, Evidence Based Medicine infrastructures, health information systems and physical capital renewal. This cost-cutting strategy may have negative long term consequences Also, important achievement in terms of limiting waiting lists, improving continuity of care and patients' centeredness, and promoting integration between social and health care may be negatively affected by unprecedented resources' cuts.

In most cases pathology departments will be faced with a complex costing problem in their efforts to meet this need, owing to the diversity of investigations performed and the variation in cost between the least and the most expensive investigations. Most methods for costing pathology services are resource intensive, from the point of view both of the initial set up and of maintenance of the data. They often require a level of financial detail that may not be available. The model described in this paper will accept crude financial data and can be refined as better data become available. In our hands the model has yielded useful information and has raised the awareness of staff to the cost of the work they perform. Although the model has been applied to an analysis of pathology costs, the principles are transferable to other areas which have a wide range of ""products"" for which individual costs may be difficult to identify.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00313029700169854,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9213341/,economics
"This article analyses the redistributive effect caused by health financing and the distribution of healthcare utilization in Argentina before and during the severe 2001/2002 economic crisis. Both dramatically changed during this period: the redistributive effect became much more positive and utilization shifted from pro-poor to pro-rich. This clearly demonstrates that when utilization is contingent on financing, changes can occur rapidly; and that an integrated approach is required when monitoring equity. From a policy perspective, the Argentine health system appears vulnerable to economic downturns mainly due to high reliance on out-of-pocket payments and the strong link between health insurance and employment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2010.03.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20452070/,economics
"Approximately 18% of US gross domestic product is spent on healthcare and 5% of that is for cancer care. With rapidly increasing oncologic drug prices, growth in cancer spending will likely far outpace overall healthcare spending growth. Developing cost-saving strategies is imperative, but economizing must not compromise patients' well-being. Providing quality care at the most economical price is the main aim. This article summarizes trends in rising cancer costs, and reviews cost-management strategies, including those proposed in the Affordable Care Act. Many programs economize by correcting inefficiencies, preventing therapeutic failures and eliminating errors. Process improvement is important, but in oncology, medications substantially drive costs. Identifying the most effective and economical treatments requires cost-effectiveness research. At the current pace, the US payers cannot continue to afford increasing costs for cancer treatments. Research on maximizing patient outcomes for reasonable costs is essential. More analyses of quality of life assessment and cost-effectiveness can support future decisions about cancer care.",https://doi.org/10.1586/14737167.2014.864561,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24328809/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To explore the possibility of using routine Hospital Episode Statistics, census data, and vital statistics to derive weights for an equitable capitation formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets for buying acute hospital services.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Analysis of a routine dataset of 9 million hospital episodes in 1991-2, extracting elective general practitioner fundholding procedures, combined with 1991 census variables, vital statistics, and data on supply of health care at ward level. Costs were attached to each procedure according to the average cost of the relevant ""Mersey"" band category.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Variation in age and sex adjusted expenditure per head on fundholding procedures across wards modelled for the impact of health and social needs variables after adjusting for variations in supply.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No sensible simple model including determinants of use other than age and sex could be derived. The most parsimonious but statistically acceptable model showed that though standardised mortality ratio and self reported illness and several social class variables were associated with utilisation, the signs and the size of the coefficients were contradictory. The most important explanation of variation was provided by age and sex differences between wards.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      An equitable system of setting general practitioner fundholders' budgets is needed. In the short term age and sex weighted capitation should form the principal basis of fundholder budgets. Utilisation data at ward level are inadequate for developing a formula which adequately adjusts for the differences in the health care needs of populations. A capitation formula based on information derived from individual cohort data may be the only means of promoting equity and efficiency and of avoiding discriminating against patients with known high cost health problems.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.309.6961.1059,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7950741/,economics
"A frequent case of irrational decision making is the tendency to escalate commitment to a chosen course of action after unsuccessful prior investments of money, effort, or time (sunk costs). In previous research it is argued that escalation does not occur when future outcomes and alternative investments are transparent. Inconsistent with this argument, in an experiment in which undergraduates were presented fictitious investment problems with sunk costs, escalation was demonstrated when full information was given about investment alternatives and estimates of future returns. Thus, it is indicated that people may escalate despite knowing that it will not make them economically better off.

"Objectives:
        
      
      Iceland was the first Nordic country to liberalise its drug distribution system, in March 1996. Subsequent regulation in January 1997 increased patients' share of drug costs. The objectives of this study were to test the assumptions that liberalizing community pharmacy ownership would lower reimbursement costs for the state's Social Security Institute and that increasing patient charges would reduce use and, therefore, lower the cost to the Institute.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on the assumptions, we built and tested two models using interrupted time series designs that contrast the monthly reimbursement costs before and after the legislation and regulation took effect. A control variable (the number of office visits to general practitioners) was tested to assess other events in the health care arena. Monthly data on these variables were provided by the Icelandic State Social Security Institute for January 1993 to August 1998 for reimbursement costs and to December 1998 for office visits to general practitioners.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Reimbursement costs have risen steadily throughout the period under study. The interrupted time series analysis did not show a substantial effect from the legislative change in March 1996 or from the regulatory intervention in January 1997.
    


          Conclusions:

"The DRG payment scheme is causing hospitals to examine the financial consequences of treating various patient populations. The purpose of this study was to examine resource utilization for hospitalized neurology patients treated during a 2-year period at an academic medical center. All patients (N = 1,993) were stratified by payor (Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, and other) and age (0-35 years, 35-65 years, and 65 years and above). Mean hospital cost per patient (exclusive of MD fees) for each payor generally rose with age. Patients 35 years of age and over consumed a disproportionately larger share of resources than younger patients. DRG payment under an all payor system would have produced a substantial deficit for this group of patients. The mean hospital length of stay, number of diagnoses per patient, and mortality, as well as percent of admission through the emergency department generally rose with age. This study demonstrated that neurology patients 35 years of age and older generated higher resource utilization than their younger counterparts and were underpaid by the current DRG reimbursement. In this study, DRG payment appeared to provide significant financial disincentives to treat older neurology patients. If our findings are widespread, the quality of neurologic care and the elderly's access to it could become limited in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.38.4.655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3127741/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Cost consolidation in the highly fragmented and inefficient Greek health care system was necessary. However, policies introduced were partly formed in a context of insufficient information. Expenditure data from a consumption point of view were lacking and the depth of the political and structural problems was of unknown magnitude to the supervisory authorities.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Drawing upon relevant literature and evidence from the newly implemented OECD System of Health Accounts, the paper evaluates the health policy responses to the economic crisis in Greece. The discussion and recommendations are also of interest to other countries where data sources are not reliable or decisions are based on preliminary data and projections.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between 2009 and 2012, across-the-board cuts have resulted in a decline in public health expenditure for inpatient care by 8.6%, for pharmaceuticals by 42.3% and for outpatient care by 34.6%. Further cuts are expected from the ongoing reforms but more structural changes are needed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Cost-containment was not well targeted and expenditure cuts were not always addressed to the real reasons of the pre-crisis cost explosion. Policy responses were restricted to quick and easy fiscal adjustment, ignoring the need for substantial structural reforms or individuals' right to access health care irrespective of their financial capacity. Developing appropriate information infrastructure, restructuring and consolidating the hospital sector and moving toward a tax-based national health insurance could offer valuable benefits to the system.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2014.07.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25150026/,economics
"Economic considerations constitute a significant factor in businesses' interest in adopting health promotion (HP) programs and in the wellness community's attempts to sell such programming to business. Substantial elements of both the business and wellness communities believe that HP programs are financially profitable, in addition to, and as a result of, improving employees' health. Examination of the foundation of this belief, however, leads to the conclusion that underlying analyses have been technically flawed and have ignored important costs of HP programs. This article discusses the limitations of these analyses and outlines the framework of a model that could provide a sound assessment of the economics of workplace HP programs. In general, it is expected that resultant analyses would find less direct profit potential in workplace HP programs but would emphasize the cost-effectiveness of many such efforts. The latter would force recognition that health, and not profit, is the principal benefit of health promotion programming. The distinction between the cost-effectiveness and cost-saving potential of health promotion is one that all interested parties should master.",https://doi.org/10.1177/109019818701400106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3104236/,economics
"In most societies, resources are distributed by individuals acting in markets and by governments through some form of collective decision-making process. Economic evaluation offers a set of tools to inform collective decisions by examining the resource requirements and outcomes of alternative policies. The 'societal perspective' has been advocated, but less consideration has been given to what this should include and its practical implementation. This paper presents a framework for economic evaluation of policies with costs and outcomes falling on different sectors (e.g. health, criminal justice, education) and involving different decision makers. It extends the 'impact inventory' developed by the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine by considering all affected individuals and reflecting how outcomes attributed to an intervention can be compared with outcomes forgone as a result of resources not being available for other purposes. The framework sets out the series of assessments to be made, distinguishing points at which value judgements feed into the evaluation, and the implications of alternative judgements. These assessments reflect the institutional arrangements of public bodies, for example, their funding, the outcomes they consider important and their relative valuations of these outcomes. By avoiding the use of an abstract 'societal perspective', the contribution of the framework is to inform multiple decision makers with different objectives and provide practical guidance on overall societal impact.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-019-00481-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31098947/,economics
"Within health technology assessment (HTA), cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analyses have been broadly accepted as important components of decision making. However, whilst they address efficiency and affordability, the issue of implementation and feasibility has been largely ignored. HTA commonly takes place within a deliberative framework that captures issues of implementation and feasibility in a qualitative manner. We argue that only through a formal quantitative assessment of resource constraints can these issues be fully addressed. This paper argues the need for resource modelling to be considered explicitly in HTA. First, economic evaluation and budget impact models are described along with their limitations in evaluating feasibility. Next, resource modelling is defined and its usefulness is described along with examples of resource modelling from the literature. Then, the important issues that need to be considered when undertaking resource modelling are described before setting out recommendations for the use of resource modelling in HTA.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0228-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25411095/,economics

"This study explores commercial insurers' claims about cost-shifting in the broader context of hospitals' responses to revenue needs. It relies on hospital survey data from 1980 and 1982, a period that pre-dates Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) for hospitals. While we find that limited amounts of cost-shifting occur, evidence does not support the notion that it is a perfect safety valve to control financial status. In addition, all-payer rate-setting does not appear to be related to hospitals' ability to shift costs. Instead, inpatient rate controls cause hospitals to contain costs, seek greater outpatient revenues and accept lower margins. Are the financial 'stresses' associated with PPS sufficient enough to kick off renewed concerns about cost-shifting? Some aggregate data from the PPS-era indicates that lower growth in Medicare payments has not resulted in cost-shifting on a widespread basis.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(87)90007-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10284618/,economics

      Narrative review.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To review the common tenets, strengths, and weaknesses of decision modeling for health economic assessment and to review the use of decision modeling in the spine literature to date.
    


          Summary of background data:
        
      
      For the majority of spinal interventions, well-designed prospective, randomized, pragmatic cost-effectiveness studies that address the specific decision-in-need are lacking. Decision analytic modeling allows for the estimation of cost-effectiveness based on data available to date. Given the rising demands for proven value in spine care, the use of decision analytic modeling is rapidly increasing by clinicians and policy makers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This narrative review discusses the general components of decision analytic models, how decision analytic models are populated and the trade-offs entailed, makes recommendations for how users of spine intervention decision models might go about appraising the models, and presents an overview of published spine economic models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A proper, integrated, clinical, and economic critical appraisal is necessary in the evaluation of the strength of evidence provided by a modeling evaluation. As is the case with clinical research, all options for collecting health economic or value data are not without their limitations and flaws. There is substantial heterogeneity across the 20 spine intervention health economic modeling studies summarized with respect to study design, models used, reporting, and general quality. There is sparse evidence for populating spine intervention models. Results mostly showed that interventions were cost-effective based on $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold. Spine care providers, as partners with their health economic colleagues, have unique clinical expertise and perspectives that are critical to interpret the strengths and weaknesses of health economic models.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Health economic models must be critically appraised for both clinical validity and economic quality before altering health care policy, payment strategies, or patient care decisions.

"The US Medicare programme, through its new Part D programme, now offers limited coverage for prescription medicines. The coverage is provided via a variety of drug plans and their respective formularies. The federal regulatory scheme generally requires that the formularies contain drugs representative of the various therapeutic classes. On the other hand, the federal government has generally refrained from making specific decisions that specific drug entities are the most cost effective and therefore must be included in the formularies. With the dawn of Medicare Part D in the US, the federal government will be increasingly involved in supporting the cost of medicines, and will need to confront this challenge in the face of tight overall economic constraints on the federal budget. Any spending on medications of questionable efficacy will inevitably compromise the ability to deliver more cost-effective healthcare measures. Laxity in the approval process for ineffective drugs may therefore result in lack of funds to support acquisition of more useful medicines for the elderly.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00002512-200623060-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16872229/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Faced with growing budget pressure, policymakers worldwide recognize the necessity of strategic disinvestment from ineffective, inefficient or harmful medical practices. However, disinvestment programs face substantial social, political and cultural challenges: mistrust, struggles for clinical autonomy or stakeholders' reluctance to engage in what can be perceived as 'rationing'. Academic literature says little about effective strategies to address these challenges. This paper provides insights on this matter. We analyzed the epistemic work of a group of policymakers at the National Health Care Institute on what was initially a disinvestment initiative within the context of the Dutch basic benefits package: the 'Appropriate Care' program. The Institute developed a strategy using national administrative data to identify and tackle low-value care covered from public funds as well as potential underuse, and achieve savings through improved organization of efficiency and quality in health care delivery. How did the Institute deal with the socio-political sensitivities associated with disinvestment by means of their epistemic work?
    


          Method:
        
      
      We conducted ethnographic research into the National Health Care Institute's epistemic practices. Research entailed document analysis, non-participant observation, in-depth conversations, and interviews with key-informants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Institute dealt with the socio-political sensitivities associated with disinvestment by democratizing the epistemic practices to identify low-value care, by warranting data analysis by clinical experts, by creating an epistemic safe space for health care professionals who were the object of research into low-value care, and by de-emphasizing the economization measure. Ultimately, this epistemic work facilitated a collaborative construction of problems relating to low-value care practices and their solutions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This case shows that - apart from the right data and adequate expertise - disinvestment requires clinical leadership and political will on the part of stakeholders. Our analysis of the Institute's Appropriate Care program shows how the epistemic effort to identify low-value care became a co-construction between policymakers, care providers, patients and insurers of problems of 'waste' in Dutch social health insurance. This collective epistemic work gave cognitive, moral and political standing to the idea of 'waste' in public health expenditure.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4434-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31488152/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Differences in payer evaluation and coverage of pharmaceuticals and medical procedures suggest that coverage may differ for medications and procedures independent of their clinical benefit. We hypothesized that coverage for medications is more restricted than corresponding coverage for nonmedication interventions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We included top-selling medications and highly utilized procedures. For each intervention-indication pair, we classified value in terms of cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year), as reported by the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry. For each intervention-indication pair and for each of 10 large payers, we classified coverage, when available, as either ""more restrictive"" or as ""not more restrictive,"" compared with a benchmark. The benchmark reflected the US Food and Drug Administration label information, when available, or pertinent clinical guidelines. We compared coverage policies and the benchmark in terms of step edits and clinical restrictions. Finally, we regressed coverage restrictiveness against intervention type (medication or nonmedication), controlling for value (cost-effectiveness more or less favorable than a designated threshold).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 392 medication and 185 procedure coverage decisions. A total of 26.3% of the medication coverage and 38.4% of the procedure coverage decisions were more restrictive than their corresponding benchmarks. After controlling for value, the odds of being more restrictive were 42% lower for medications than for procedures. Including unfavorable tier placement in the definition of ""more restrictive"" greatly increased the proportion of medication coverage decisions classified as ""more restrictive"" and reversed our findings.

"In a recent leading article in PharmacoEconomics, Nuijten described some methods for incorporating uncertainty into health economic models and for utilising the information on uncertainty regarding the cost effectiveness of a therapy in resource allocation decision-making. His proposals are found to suffer from serious flaws in statistical and health economic reasoning.Nuijten's suggestions for incorporating uncertainty: (a) wrongly interpret the p-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true; (b) represent this probability wrongly by truncating the input distribution; and (c) in the specific example of an antiparkinsonian drug uses a completely inappropriate p-value of 0.05 when the null hypothesis would, in reality, be emphatically disproved by the data.His suggestions regarding minimum important differences in cost effectiveness: (a) introduce areas of indifference that suggest inappropriate reliance on cost minimisation while failing to recognise that decisions should be based on expected costs versus benefits; and (b) offer no guidance on how the probabilities associated with these areas could be used in decision-making. Furthermore, Nuijten's model for Parkinson's disease is over-simplified to the point of providing a bad example of modelling practice, which may mislead the readers of PharmacoEconomics. The rationale for this paper is to ensure that readers do not apply inappropriate analyses as a result of following the proposals contained in Nuijten's paper.

Findings suggest that a greater proportion of the economic burden of prescription drugs in coming years will be borne by those who use them.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.23.5.226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371389/,economics
"Access to health care interventions can be impeded when significant patient travel is required. In this economic evaluation we compare, from a societal perspective, three scenarios for the delivery of radiation treatment to an idealized population of 1,600 patients distributed between two urban nodes (1,200 + 400 patients each) separated by up to 500 km. As it is implicitly assumed that the clinical outcome for those patients who access the system is independent of the service delivery model, this study constitutes a cost minimization analysis from a societal perspective. The costs to the health care system are based on an activity costing model developed by us and consistent with recent Canadian studies. The costs to the patient are approximated by a formula that includes direct costs (travel and accommodation) and indirect (time) costs, with the latter based on a human capital approach. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to confirm the robustness of our conclusions both to uncertainties in the input data and to the inclusion of time costs, the estimation of which remains controversial. From a societal cost perspective only, we show that outreach radiotherapy (central comprehensive facility and satellite) is the economically superior service delivery model for separations between 30 km and 170 km. Beyond 170 km, a fully decentralized service would be warranted if the only consideration were societal economic advantage.",https://doi.org/10.1053/clon.2001.9211,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11292133/,economics

"Pharmacotherapeutic decisions are increasingly constrained in all clinical settings by the costs of drug treatment and medical care. Some biotech therapies (e.g., Avastin, Cerzyme, Herceptin, Gleevec, Erbitux) can cost from $10,000 to more than $100,000 per treatment episode. In 1996 the average drug treatment cost for advanced colon cancer was $500, and the average patient survival was 11 months. In 2006 the average drug treatment cost for such patients was $250,000, and the average patient survival was 24 months.(1) It is apparent that we are quickly arriving at a situation in which the determinants of medical decision making are not simply the clinical risks and benefits of treatment options but also how these are balanced against the economic costs of therapy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/clpt.2008.124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18679182/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      The borderline personality disorder is a common mental disorder. It is frequently associated with various mental co-morbidities and a fundamental loss of functioning. The borderline personality disorder causes high costs to society. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature review of existing economic evaluations of treatments for borderline personality disorder.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and NHSEED for partial and full economic evaluations regarding borderline personality disorder. Reported cost data were inflated to the year 2012 and converted into US-$ using purchasing power parities to allow for comparability. Quality assessment of the studies was performed by means of the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria checklist, a checklist developed by a Delphi method in cooperation with 23 international experts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 6 partial and 9 full economic evaluations. The methodical quality was moderate (fulfilled quality criteria: 79.2% [SD: 15.4%] in partial economic evaluations, 77.3% [SD: 8.5%] in full economic evaluations). Most evaluations analysed psychotherapeutic interventions. Although ambiguous, most evidence exists on dialectical-behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy and schema-focused therapy are cost-saving. Evidence on other interventions is scarce.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The economic evidence is not sufficient to draw robust conclusions for all treatments. It is possible that some treatments are cost-effective. Most evidence exists on dialectical-behavioural therapy. Yet, it is ambiguous. Further research concerning the cost-effectiveness of treatments is necessary as well as the identification of relevant cost categories and the validation of effect measures.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25265185/,economics
"Actinic keratosis is among the most commonly treated skin conditions in the outpatient setting. Its prevalence spans the globe, with greater distribution in fair skinned individuals and the immunocompromised. With high prevalence, increasing incidence and the risk of transformation to a cancerous lesion, prevention and timely treatment present opportunities to rein in costs. The purpose of this article is to review published economic studies relating to the treatment of actinic keratosis, to summarize results discussing the cost drivers of current treatment modalities and to identify parameters most likely to influence the cost effectiveness of treatment. We systematically conducted a published literature search for pharmacoeconomic research of actinic keratosis using title, abstract or full-text searches with the following search terms ([actinic OR solar] AND [keratosis OR keratoses]) AND (economic OR cost OR pharmacoeconomics OR decision). We included published articles referencing actinic keratosis in a standalone study or in a broader study referencing non-melanoma skin cancer and articles evaluating cost-of-illness, cost-of-treatment, cost minimization, cost effectiveness, cost utility, cost-benefit analysis and cost consequence. Our review of the literature found nine studies devoted to pharmacoeconomic considerations of actinic keratosis treatments, with one article investigating both cost-of-illness and cost-of-treatment, two measuring cost-of-illness, two evaluating cost-of-treatment, one focusing on cost minimization, and three focusing on cost effectiveness. The literature compared a broad range of actinic keratosis treatments including topical medications, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, excision and a combination of treatment modalities. The direct cost of actinic keratosis management in the US was estimated at $US1.2 billion per year, with indirect costs totalling $US295 million (year 2004 values). The primary drivers of cost were physician office visits and associated procedures. Pharmacoeconomic research defining standards, outcomes and areas of efficiencies in the treatment of actinic keratosis is in its infancy. To move towards more comprehensive analysis, research needs to focus on updating epidemiological data, evolving evidence-based standards, delineating cost drivers in immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations, and on health outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200927060-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19640009/,economics
"Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to review the methodology that has been adopted in previous economic evaluations of alcohol treatment and offer research recommendations with a view to enhancing the consistency and harmonization of economic evaluations in the alcohol field.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Published full economic evaluations of alcohol treatment were retrieved using a systematic search. The studies were analysed in terms of the identification, measurement and valuation methods used to assess the society-level consequences and the methods used to carry out the analysis of individual-level consequences and costs of the intervention. A taxonomy of alcohol-related consequences was developed and used as a framework for the methodology extraction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty- seven studies were selected. Almost half of the studies did not include society-level consequences in their analysis. Some consequences of alcohol treatment at a societal level, such as the impact of treatment on health-related quality of life of family and friends of the drinker, have never been considered in the economic analysis. There was no agreement regarding the individual health consequences used in the evaluations. Measures capturing life years and morbidity have not been extensively used in the alcohol field. The level of reporting treatment costs on the reviewed studies is generally well detailed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The literature is still rather sparse in this area and further research is required to fulfil the gaps. If a common methodology is adopted in future economic evaluations of alcohol treatment, more stable cost-effectiveness estimates will be produced and informed decisions for resources allocation to alcohol treatments will be possible.",https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/agp067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19808943/,economics

"Under the Affordable Care Act, if one family member has an employer offer of single coverage deemed to be affordable-that is, costing less than 9.66 percent of family income in 2016-then all family members are ineligible for tax credits for Marketplace coverage, even if the cost of providing coverage to the whole family is greater than 9.66 percent of income. More than six million people live in such families and as a result are ineligible for premium tax credits. These families face premiums that can amount to 15.8 percent of income, or 12.0 percent after the tax advantages of employer-sponsored health coverage are factored in. We modeled the potential impact of changing the affordability test to take into account the cost of family coverage. Doing so would reduce spending on premiums from 12.0 percent to 6.3 percent of income, significantly alleviating financial burdens, but would generate little additional coverage. We estimated the additional costs to the federal government for premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions to be between $3.7 billion and $6.5 billion in 2016.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27385230/,economics
"Economic facts on cigarette consumption and production are summarized, and the health consequences of cigarette smoking are reviewed. The magnitude and distribution of these health consequences among the population are discussed in economic terms, that is, in an ""accounting framework"" comprising such disparate elements as lost lives, lost livelihoods, pain, fear, discomfort, medical costs, excise taxes, and the costs of regulating smoking behaviors. The importance of these factors and their potential influence on public policy and individual behavior are considered. Difficulties include assigning a monetary value to an expected extension of life, the ""voluntary"" nature of smoking (even though most smokers wish they could quit), deciding what to include as economic consequences of smoking, and the attribution to smoking of some share of the costs for diseases known to be affected by smoking. ""Transfers,"" or purely financial transactions, in contrast to expenditures for goods and services, are explained as one assessment component of the economic impact of smoking-related diseases.

"In this article, we describe expenditure and wealth patterns, indicators of long-run economic well-being, for a sample of young Guatemalan adults interviewed for the Human Capital Study 2002-04, finding a number of differences across subgroups of the sample. The main difference across birth-year cohorts is that younger subjects tend to live in smaller households, with lower total annual household expenditures (and fewer durable goods), though per capita measures are similar across cohorts. This appears to be related to life-cycle fertility patterns. There is a clear positive association between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and current levels of expenditure and durable goods ownership. This association does not hold for all households, however, as there is both upward and downward ""mobility"" in the sample. Those living in the capital have the highest overall wealth levels, consistent with typical rural-urban patterns. Where there are expenditure differences across groups, they tend to be driven by differences in nonfood rather than food expenditures. Lastly, the study sample is relatively well off compared with their compatriots, with a poverty rate of 35% and an extreme poverty rate of only 3%, against national averages of 56% and 15%, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1177/15648265050262s111,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16060217/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      With a greater emphasis on cost containment in many health care systems, it has become common to evaluate each physician's relative resource use. This study explored the major factors that influence the economic performance rankings of medical clinics in the Korea National Health Insurance (NHI) program by assessing the consistency between cost-efficiency indices constructed using different profiling criteria.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data on medical care benefit costs for outpatient care at medical clinics nationwide were collected from the NHI claims database. We calculated eight types of cost-efficiency index with different profiling criteria for each medical clinic and investigated the agreement between the decile rankings of each index pair using the weighted kappa statistic.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The exclusion of pharmacy cost lowered agreement between rankings to the lowest level, and differences in case-mix classification also lowered agreement considerably.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A medical clinic may be identified as either cost-efficient or cost-inefficient, even when using the same index, depending on the profiling criteria applied. Whether a country has a single insurance or a multiple-insurer system, it is very important to have standardized profiling criteria for the consolidated management of health care costs.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-11-189,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846374/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Interest in assessing the value of health-care services in Germany has considerably increased since the foundation of the Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, IQWiG (Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care). The practical application of value assessment illustrates how problematic the process can be. In all decisions made for the provision of health care, data concerning the measurable dimensions (quantity and quality of efficacy and effectiveness, validity of the results and costs) flow into a complex and not yet standardized decision-making process concerning public financing. Some of these decisions are based on data of uncertain validity, unknown reproducibility and unclear appropriateness.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      In this paper we describe the theoretical aspects of value from psychological and economic viewpoints and discuss national and international approaches. Methodic details and difficulties in assessing the value of health-care services are analysed. A definition of the intangible value of health-care services will be proposed which contains only three factors: the absolute risk reduction (usually a measure of efficacy), the validity of the scientific papers examined and the type of the expected effectiveness (prevention of death and disability, restitution of well-being). The intangible value describes the additional benefit when comparing two possible actions, like treatment or observation only.
    


          Conclusion:

"Evaluations of the early phases of state efforts to control hospital costs led to discouraging conclusions about the effectiveness of such programs. To determine whether cost regulation has improved since then, we compared the experience of the six states that have comprehensive, legally mandated hospital rate-setting programs with that of the states without such programs during the period from 1970 to 1978. During the last three years of this period, the average annual rate of increase in hospital costs in rate-setting states has been 11.2 per cent, as compared with an average annual rate of increase of 14.3 per cent in states without such programs (P < 0.05).

As the population of most developed countries ages so the prevalence of diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are likely to increase. To facilitate planning and informed debate regarding making provisions for this disease it is important that we have a clear understanding of the economic impact of visual impairment associated with AMD. In this paper we assess the state of current knowledge based on a review of published evidence in scientific journals. Based on our assessment of the evidence we argue that the paucity of research studies on the subject and wide variation in estimates produced from the few studies available make it difficult to assess with confidence the likely average direct cost-of-illness associated with AMD. We further argue that significant gaps in our understanding of the costs of AMD (particularly in respect of indirect costs) also exist. Current research should be augmented by more comprehensive studies.,https://doi.org/10.2165/00002512-200623030-00004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16608377/,economics
"Any effort to control the rise in health care costs must start with analyzing the causes, which are really quite simple. Most cost control efforts fail because they do not address the causes. The causes are large subsidies in several forms that send a false message that health care is free and should be used abundantly, and expansive reimbursement programs that reward inefficient providers with higher payments. This combination of demand stimulation and cost-plus reimbursement produced the world's most expensive health care delivery system and strident calls for reform. A long overdue change in public policy took effect October 1, 1983, when Medicare payments moved from cost-plus reimbursement to fixed, prospectively determined prices. Because it addressed one of the causes of medical inflation, this change has been effective in slowing the rise in Medicare expenditures. Sponsorship of a hospital is not a determinant of its cost-effectiveness. There are examples of efficient and inefficient hospitals in both the voluntary and the investor-owned or taxpaying hospitals. The determining factor is the will of management to keep costs under control.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0002-9149(85)80008-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3927697/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      To understand the forces propelling countries to legislate universal health insurance.
    


          Data source/study design:
        
      
      Descriptive review and exploratory synthesis of historic data on economic, geographic, socio-demographic, and political factors.
    


          Data extraction methods:

          Principal findings:
        
      
      Ten countries with universal health insurance were studied. For the five countries that passed final universal insurance laws prior to 1958, we found that two forces of ""historical context"" (i.e., social solidarity and historic patterns), one ""ongoing dynamic force"" (political pressures), and ""one uniqueness of the moment"" force (legislative permissiveness) played a major role. For the five countries that passed final legislation between 1967 and 2010, the predominant factors were two ""ongoing dynamic forces"" (economic pressures and political pressures) and one ""uniqueness of the moment"" force (leadership). In general, countries in the former group made steady progress, whereas those in the latter group progressed in abrupt leaps.

"Background:
        
      
      A review of economic evaluations of public health interventions assessed by NICE between 2005 and 2010 found 85% were cost-effective. Owen et al. (The cost-effectiveness of public health interventions. J Public Health 2012;34(1):37-45). With significant pressure on budgets the role of economics in securing funding remains important. This study updates the earlier analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Economic evaluations carried out between 2011 and 2016 were categorized: cost-utility analysis (CUA), cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-consequences analysis (CCA). Cost-effectiveness estimates were analysed and compared with Owen et al. (The cost-effectiveness of public health interventions. J Public Health 2012;34(1):37-45).
    


          Results:

Compared with the earlier period, the median ICER for the 138 estimates was substantially higher (£7843 versus £1053) and there was greater variability (a higher proportion in the later period was cost-saving, but a higher proportion was also over £20 000 per quality adjusted life year).

"The Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is far lag behind the sustainable targets that set out in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is highly needed to embark the priorities by their member countries to devise sustainable policies for accessing clean technologies, energy demand, finance, and food production to mitigate high-mass carbon emissions and conserve environmental agenda in the national policy agenda. The study evaluated United Nation's SDGs for environmental conservation and emission reduction in the panel of 35 selected SSA countries, during a period of 1995-2016. The study further analyzed the variable's relationship in inter-temporal forecasting framework for the next 10 years' time period, i.e., 2017-2026. The parameter estimates for the two models, i.e., CO2 model and PM2.5 models are analyzed by Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimator that handle possible endogeneity issue from the given models. The results rejected the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for CO2 emissions, while it supported for PM2.5 emissions with a turning point of US$5540 GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$. The results supported the ""pollution haven hypothesis"" for CO2 emissions, while this hypothesis is not verified for PM2.5 emissions. The major detrimental factors are technologies, FDI inflows, and food deficit that largely increase carbon emissions in a panel of SSA countries. The IPAT hypothesis is not verified in both the emissions; however, population density will largely influenced CO2 emissions in the next 10 years' time period. The PM2.5 emissions will largely be influenced by high per capita income, followed by trade openness, and technologies, over a time horizon. Thus, the United Nation's sustainable development agenda is highly influenced by socio-economic and environmental factors that need sound action plans by their member countries to coordinate and collaborate with each other and work for Africa's green growth agenda.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05056-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30980369/,economics
"Evidence from economic evaluations is often not used to inform healthcare policy despite being well regarded by policy makers and physicians. This article employs the accessibility and acceptability framework to review the barriers to using evidence from economic evaluation in healthcare policy and the strategies used to overcome these barriers. Economic evaluations are often inaccessible to policymakers due to the absence of relevant economic evaluations, the time and cost required to conduct and interpret economic evaluations, and lack of expertise to evaluate quality and interpret results. Consistently reported factors that limit the translation of findings from economic evaluations into healthcare policy include poor quality of research informing economic evaluations, assumptions used in economic modelling, conflicts of interest, difficulties in transferring resources between sectors, negative attitudes to healthcare rationing, and the absence of equity considerations. Strategies to overcome these barriers have been suggested in the literature, including training, structured abstract databases, rapid evaluation, reporting checklists for journals, and considering factors other than cost effectiveness in economic evaluations, such as equity or budget impact. The factors that prevent or encourage decision makers to use evidence from economic evaluations have been identified, but the relative importance of these factors to decision makers is uncertain.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-014-0132-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25288052/,economics
"According to Freidson, third-party payers have eroded the political and economic authority of medicine. To what extent is this also true for alternative practitioners such as physical therapists? The effect of Medicare's restrictive guidelines on physical therapy practice in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) is examined. SNF physical therapists in Connecticut were surveyed (response rate 99%) using a mixture of open-ended and fixed-alternative responses. Results indicate that SNF physical therapists recognize Medicare criteria and view them as important. Twenty-five to 33% of SNF therapists recommend care based on the guidelines. Younger therapists, therapists with fewer years in the field, and contract therapists are more greatly influenced by the guidelines than older, more experienced, staff therapists (P < 0.08). Those who recommend care based on the guidelines may do so because of possible nonpayment for services already rendered, or because they fear loss of their positions. The majority of Connecticut SNF patients who qualify do receive therapy and Medicare coverage. Therapists may use their knowledge of the guidelines to secure services for their patients, or SNFs may be selecting patients that have the best chances for recovery. Like physicians, SNF physical therapists are under pressure from third-party payers to economize and rationalize, but most continue to secure services for their patients.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)00221-e,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7792627/,economics
"Recognizing the health effects of nonhealth policies, scholars and others seeking to improve Americans' health have advocated the implementation of a culture of health-which would call attention to and prioritize health as a key outcome of policy making across all levels of government and in the private sector. Adopting this ""health-in-all-policies"" lens, policy makers are paying increasing attention to health impacts as they debate policies in areas such as urban planning, housing, and transportation. Yet the health impacts of economic policies that shape the distribution of income and wealth are often overlooked. Pooling data from all fifty states for the period 1990-2010, we provide a broad portrait of how economic policies affect health. Overall, we found better health outcomes in states that enacted higher tax credits for the poor or higher minimum wage laws and in states without a right-to-work law that limits union power. Notably, these policies focus on increasing the incomes of low-income and working-class families, instead of on shaping the resources available to wealthier individuals. Incorporating these findings into a health-in-all-policies agenda will require leadership from the health sector, including a willingness to step into core and polarizing debates about redistribution.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0710,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27834245/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      Given the significant costs of reduced productivity (presenteeism) in comparison to absenteeism, and overall societal costs, presenteeism has a potentially important role to play in economic evaluations. However, these costs are often excluded. The objective of this study is to review applied cost of illness studies and economic evaluations to identify valuation methods used for, and impact of including presenteeism costs in practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A structured systematic review was carried out to explore (i) the extent to which presenteeism has been applied in cost of illness studies and economic evaluations and (ii) the overall impact of including presenteeism on overall costs and outcomes. Potential articles were identified by searching Medline, PsycINFO and NHS EED databases. A standard template was developed and used to extract information from economic evaluations and cost of illness studies incorporating presenteeism costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 28 studies were included in the systematic review which also demonstrated that presenteeism costs are rarely included in full economic evaluations. Estimation and monetisation methods differed between the instruments. The impact of disease on presenteeism whilst in paid work is high.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The potential impact of presenteeism costs needs to be highlighted and greater consideration should be given to including these in economic evaluations and cost of illness studies. The importance of including presenteeism costs when conducting economic evaluation from a societal perspective should be emphasised in national economic guidelines and more methodological work is required to improve the practical application of presenteeism instruments to generate productivity cost estimates.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.12.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28292496/,economics
"It is obvious that escalating costs of medical care must be curbed. Fortunately, since the major proportion of health care costs relate to inpatient management, the diagnosis-related group ""experiment"" forces the medical community to examine carefully the costs of the specific components of health care delivery. One such item is the cost of nosocomial infections. With respect to the potential importance of hospital-acquired infections and reimbursement under the diagnosis-related group system, several points should be underscored. Nosocomial infections represent a direct economic liability of $5 to $10 billion annually in the United States. Under the new diagnosis-related group reimbursement system, it is probable that very little of the costs related to excess stay resulting from infections will be reimbursed to hospitals. For the first time, there are data indicating that as much as one third of hospital-acquired infections can be prevented by implementing effective infection control programs. The currently available information suggests that under the existing diagnosis-related group reimbursement system, hospitals with effective infection control programs can significantly improve their economic position.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9343(85)90356-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3925777/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      To evaluate, discuss and compare economic aspects of teleradiological applications in CT examinations in a small hospital. Scenario (1): CT examination by an extern institution including transport of a patient. Szenario (2): External consultation of an internal CT examination (teleradiology according to ROV). Scenario (3): Complete in-house radiology department. To evaluate economic aspects of teleradiology service providers.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Costs have been separated into fixed and variable costs in a model. Total costs of 500 CT examinations per year have been calculated for the three scenarios. A break-even analysis has been performed to determine the necessary/minimal number of CTs per year for economical advantages. The number of CT consultations for teleradiology service providers to make profit has been calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Scenario (1): This is the most cost-effective scenario for 500 CTs per year, but most time-consuming. Beyond 548 CTs per year using a single slice CT and 965 CTs per year using a multislice CT the teleradiology scenario [scenario (2)] is most cost-effective. Beyond 1065 CTs per year an in-house radiology department [scenario (3)] is economically reasonable. On the basis of 30 Euros per CT consultation a teleradiology service providing system will be profitable starting from 322 CT consultations per year.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Teleradiology applications are economically reasonable in a wide range in small hospitals. CT teleradiology services can also be provided on a cost-effective basis at a reachable number of consultations.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2005-858265,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15973605/,economics
"It is no secret that the health care environment today is motivated by the underlying, largely economic impetus of managed care. This is particularly evident within the organ transplantation community, where third party payers hope to minimize their financial risk by relying more and more on ""centers of excellence"" networks to provide high-quality transplant services in an economically efficient manner. The burgeoning interest in the economics of liver transplantation raises a number of complex, yet important, issues to which transplant professionals should lend serious thought. This article addresses these issues by offering an elementary guide to contract negotiations with third party payers. Among other things, the article: (1) discusses several methods by which third party payers avert and shift risk to transplant programs; (2) emphasizes the importance and identifies the limitations of actuaries and other consulting; (3) demonstrates, with examples, how comparative analyses of existing data sources, both public and proprietary, can assist rational decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s1089-3261(05)70272-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15562570/,economics
"This paper discusses some of the design issues that are most important as cost-effectiveness analysis of preventive care advances from a novel application of economic reasoning to become an accepted aid in decision-making. In this new role, cost-effectiveness studies must be more consistent in approach and more standardized in assumptions than they have been in the past, so that valid comparisons can be made on the basis of studies done by different authors, or by the same authors at different times. The paper discusses the issues of the perspective of the study; the choice of discount rate; medical care costs in added years of life; measurement of the costs of institutionalization; measures of health effects that reflect changes in the quality as well as the quantity of life; and the proper place of estimates of earnings. Proposals are made in each of these areas to help standardize future studies.",https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470720912.ch13,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3921319/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Economic evaluation is assuming increasing importance as an integral component of health services research.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To conduct a systematic review of the literature and assess the evidence from studies presenting orthodontic treatment outcomes and the related costs.
    


          Materials/methods:
        
      
      The literature review was conducted in four steps, according to Goodman's model, in order to identify all studies evaluating economic aspects of orthodontic interventions. The search covered the databases Medline, Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Google Scholar, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and SCOPUS, for the period from 1966 to September 2014. The inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials comparing at least two different orthodontic interventions, evaluation of both economic and orthodontic outcomes, and study populations of all ages. The quality of each included study was assessed as limited, moderate, or high. The overall evidence was assessed according to the GRADE system (The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The applied terms for searches yielded 1838 studies, of which 989 were excluded as duplicates. Application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria identified 26 eligible studies for which the full-text versions were retrieved and scrutinized. At the final analysis, eight studies remained. Three studies were based on cost-effectiveness analyses and the other five on cost-minimization analysis. Two of the cost-minimization studies included a societal perspective, i.e. the sum of direct and indirect costs. The aims of most of the studies varied widely and of studies comparing equivalent treatment methods, few were of sufficiently high study quality. Thus, the literature to date provides an inadequate evidence base for economic aspects of orthodontic treatment.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This systematic review disclosed that few orthodontic studies have presented both economic and clinical outcomes.

"Productivity costs are frequently omitted from economic evaluations, despite their often strong impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes. This neglect may be partly explained by the lack of standardization regarding the methodology of estimating productivity costs. This paper aims to contribute to standardization of productivity cost methodology by offering practical guidance on how to estimate productivity costs in economic evaluations. The paper discusses the identification, measurement and valuation of productivity losses. It is recommended to include not only productivity losses related to absenteeism from and reduced productivity at paid work, but also those related to unpaid work. Hence, it is recommended to use a measurement instrument including questions about both paid and unpaid productivity, such as the iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) or the Valuation of Lost Productivity (VOLP). We indicate how to apply the friction cost and the human capital approach and give practical guidance on deriving final cost estimates.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0132-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24504850/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To describe changes in hospitals' competitive strategies, specifically the relative emphasis placed on strategies for competing along price and nonprice (i.e., service, amenities, perceived quality) dimensions, and the reasons for any observed shifts.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study uses data gathered through the Community Tracking Study site visits, a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of 12 U.S. communities. Research teams visited each of these communities every two years since 1996 and conducted between 50 to 90 semistructured interviews. Additional information on hospital competition and strategy was gathered from secondary data.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      We found that hospitals' strategic emphasis changed significantly between 1996-1997 and 2000-2001. In the mid-1990s, hospitals primarily competed on price through ""wholesale"" strategies (i.e., providing services attractive to managed care plans). By 2000-2001, nonprice competition was becoming increasingly important and hospitals were reviving ""retail"" strategies (i.e., providing services attractive to individual physicians and the patients they serve). Three major factors explain this shift in hospital strategy: less than anticipated selective contracting and capitated payment; the freeing up of hospital resources previously devoted to horizontal and vertical integration strategies; and, the emergence and growth of new competitors.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Renewed emphasis on nonprice competition and retail strategies, and the service mimicking and one-upmanship that result, suggest that a new medical arms race is emerging. However, there are important differences between the medical arms race today and the one that occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s: the hospital market is more concentrated and price competition remains relatively important. The development of a new medical arms race has significant research and policy implications.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.00124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12650375/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Industrialized world-based healthcare providers are increasingly off-shoring low-end healthcare services such as medical transcription, billing and insurance claims. High-skill medical jobs such as tele-imaging and tele-pathology are also being sub-contracted to developing countries. Despite its importance, little theory or research exists to explain what factors affect industry growth. The article's goals, therefore, are to examine economic processes associated with developing economies' shift from low- to high-value information technology enabled healthcare services, and to investigate how these differ in terms of legitimacy from regulative, normative and cognitive institutions in the sending country and how healthcare services differ from other services.
    


          Design/methodology/approach:
        
      
      This research is conceptual and theory-building. Broadly, its approach can be described as a positivistic epistemology.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Anti off-shoring regulative, normative and cognitive pressures in the sending country are likely to be stronger in healthcare than in most business process outsourcing. Moreover, such pressures are likely to be stronger in high-value rather than in low-value healthcare off-shoring. The findings also indicate that off-shoring low-value healthcare services and emergent healthcare industries in a developing economy help accumulate implicit and tacit knowledge required for off-shoring high-value healthcare services.
    


          Research limitations/implications:
        
      
      The approach lacks primary data and empirical documentation.
    


          Practical implications:
        
      
      The article helps in understanding industry drivers and its possible future direction. The findings help in understanding the lens through which various institutional actors in a sending country view healthcare service off-shoring.
    


          Originality/value:
        
      
      The article's value stems from its analytical context, mechanisms and processes associated with developing economies' shift to high-value healthcare off-shoring services.",https://doi.org/10.1108/09526861111150716,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21916147/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Recent increases in life expectancy may greatly expand future Alzheimer's Disease (AD) burdens. China's demographic profile, aging workforce and predicted increasing burden of AD-related care make its economy vulnerable to AD impacts. Previous economic estimates of AD predominantly focus on health system burdens and omit wider whole-economy effects, potentially underestimating the full economic benefit of effective treatment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      AD-related prevalence, morbidity and mortality for 2011-2050 were simulated and were, together with associated caregiver time and costs, imposed on a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model of the Chinese economy. Both economic and non-economic outcomes were analyzed.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Simulated Chinese AD prevalence quadrupled during 2011-50 from 6-28 million. The cumulative discounted value of eliminating AD equates to China's 2012 GDP (US$8 trillion), and the annual predicted real value approaches US AD cost-of-illness (COI) estimates, exceeding US$1 trillion by 2050 (2011-prices). Lost labor contributes 62% of macroeconomic impacts. Only 10% derives from informal care, challenging previous COI-estimates of 56%.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Health and macroeconomic models predict an unfolding 2011-2050 Chinese AD epidemic with serious macroeconomic consequences. Significant investment in research and development (medical and non-medical) is warranted and international researchers and national authorities should therefore target development of effective AD treatment and prevention strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.12.019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26981556/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Facing financial pressures, the provinces and territories have chosen to use ""cost-effectiveness"" for making decisions about drug listings. This study examines the scientific basis for the procedures used to determine cost-effectiveness in 5 Canadian provinces.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Questionnaires were mailed to key provincial informants asking about the respondent's expertise and role, the administrative and scientific basis for decision-making, organizational structures and other factors in the scientific evaluation and decision-making process, and the transparency of the process. There were also questions about the data required and received and their importance, the place of cost-effectiveness and other economic impact evaluations, the data sources for them, and the use of follow-up monitoring to evaluate the decisions made.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Information required by the provinces for decision-making about cost-effectiveness is not available to them at the time of their decisions about listing new medications. The primary sources of data on both efficacy and cost-effectiveness are pharmaceutical companies. Efficacy information is generated in a scientifically rigorous manner, whereas the effectiveness and cost data are estimates potentially subject to biases and evaluated by judgement (expert opinion) alone. Moreover, there is no collaboration in the assessment process between provinces. The outcomes are large differences between provinces in the decisions made and, hence, in the pharmaceuticals accessible to residents.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Current methods for making decisions about provincial drug listings are based on inadequate data, and the lack of consistency in the provinces' decisions suggest they may be scientifically flawed. We recommend establishing a single national scientific review committee, with re-evaluation of each drug's cost-effectiveness after a suitable period of monitored use.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03405029,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12448863/,economics
"As industry sponsorship of pharmacoeconomic studies has increased, concerns have been raised about potential biases, owing to the conflicts of interest that this sponsorship creates. A review of the literature indicates that there are some causes for concern, given the fact that most pharmacoeconomic studies report positive findings for the sponsor's drug. However, a more detailed analysis suggests that, although the methodologic quality of some published studies may be poor, the main reason for positive results is that companies only sponsor economic studies where a positive outcome is likely. Therefore, it is concluded that the best way of dealing with perceptions of sponsorship bias is not increased rhetoric, but rather increased public funding for economic evaluation of medicines, thereby creating a true mixed economy for research funding in this field.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11912-001-0027-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11489241/,economics
"Lowering both Medicare spending and the rate of Medicare spending growth is important for the nation's fiscal health. Policy makers in search of ways to achieve these reductions have looked at the role that supplemental coverage for Medicare beneficiaries plays in Medicare spending. Supplemental coverage makes health care more affordable for beneficiaries but also makes beneficiaries insensitive to the cost of their care, thereby increasing the demand for care. Ours is the first empirical study to investigate whether supplemental Medicare coverage is associated with higher rates of spending growth over time. We found that supplemental insurance coverage was associated with significantly higher rates of overall spending growth. Specifically, employer-sponsored and self-purchased supplemental coverage were associated with annual total spending growth rates of 7.17 percent and 7.18 percent, respectively, compared to 6.08 percent annual growth for beneficiaries without supplemental coverage. Results for Medicare program spending were more equivocal, however. Our results are consistent with the belief that current trends away from generous employer-sponsored supplemental coverage and efforts to restrict the generosity of supplemental coverage may slow spending growth.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1230,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650320/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Growing evidence has documented economic spillover effects experienced by intensive caregivers across the lifecycle. These spillover effects are rarely incorporated in economic analyses of health interventions. When these costs are captured, it is shown that commonly applied methods for valuing caregiver time may be underestimating the true opportunity costs of informal care. We explore how intensive caregiving is associated with economic outcomes for caregivers aged 18 years and older.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used the cross-sectional 2013 RAND Survey of Military and Veteran Caregivers, a survey of 3876 caregivers and non-caregivers aged 18 years and older to conduct multivariable analyses and calculate average marginal effects, focusing on the association between intensive caregiving (i.e., providing ≥ 20 h of weekly care) and six economic outcomes: schooling, labor force participation, taking unpaid time off of work, cutting back work hours, quitting a job, and early retirement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Intensive caregivers are 13 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] 8-18) less likely to be employed than non-caregivers. Intensive caregivers are 3 percentage points (95% CI 0.5-5) more likely to cut back schooling, 6 percentage points (95% CI 2-10) more likely to take unpaid time off of work, 4 percentage points (95% CI 0.1-9) more likely to cut back work hours, 12 percentage points (95% CI 8-15) more likely to quit a job, and 5 percentage points (95% CI 2-7) more likely to retire early due to caregiving responsibilities relative to non-intensive caregivers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite the difficulty of quantifying the true opportunity costs of informal care, policy makers and researchers need to understand these costs. The higher the opportunity costs of unpaid care provision, the less likely it is that caregivers will provide this care and the less economically attractive this 'free' source of care is from a societal perspective.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00784-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30864064/,economics
"The dominant managed care model in the USA is the individual practice association (IPA), in which physicians in separate practices contract with a health plan. One alternative model, the capitated multispecialty group practice (CMGP), has some distinct advantages: (i) the best randomized trial comparing a health management organization (HMO) with indemnity insurance showed equivalent health outcomes for a prepaid group-practice model HMO, with about a 40% saving in cost, mostly from lower hospital utilization. There is no comparable evidence for IPA-style HMO's; (ii) most managed care plans control costs through 'gatekeeper' primary care physicians or capitated payment. Strong financial disincentives to care, applied to small practices, lead to a significant risk of withholding needed care. Large capitated groups diffuse the risk among hundreds or thousands of physicians; (iii) small practices also lack the financial resources and expertise to develop information systems, continuous quality improvement programs, and other means of improving efficiency. Larger groups can integrate specialty and primary care, laboratory, pharmacy, information technology and other services, to improve quality and cost-effectiveness, while maintaining physician control of the process; (iv) in urban California, HMO enrollment in six large capitated groups increased by 91% from 1990 to 1994. Hospital utilization for these groups was less than half the USA average; (v) because it is self-insured, the CMGP could contract directly with purchasers, eliminating the need for the insurance intermediary. The CGMP offers an ethical, effective alternative that maintains the primacy of the physician in health care: physician-managed care.",https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/10.5.427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9828032/,economics
"A better understanding of the economic burden of diabetes constitutes a major public health challenge in order to design new ways to curb diabetes health care expenditure. The aim of this study was to develop a new cost-of-illness method in order to assess the specific and nonspecific costs of diabetes from a public payer perspective. Using medical and administrative data from the major French national health insurance system covering about 59 million individuals in 2012, we identified people with diabetes and then estimated the economic burden of diabetes. Various methods were used: (a) global cost of patients with diabetes, (b) cost of treatment directly related to diabetes (i.e., 'medicalized approach'), (c) incremental regression-based approach, (d) incremental matched-control approach, and (e) a novel combination of the 'medicalized approach' and the 'incremental matched-control' approach. We identified 3 million individuals with diabetes (5% of the population). The total expenditure of this population amounted to €19 billion, representing 15% of total expenditure reimbursed to the entire population. Of the total expenditure, €10 billion (52%) was considered to be attributable to diabetes care: €2.3 billion (23% of €10 billion) was directly attributable, and €7.7 billion was attributable to additional reimbursed expenditure indirectly related to diabetes (77%). Inpatient care represented the major part of the expenditure attributable to diabetes care (22%) together with drugs (20%) and medical auxiliaries (15%). Antidiabetic drugs represented an expenditure of about €1.1 billion, accounting for 49% of all diabetes-specific expenditure. This study shows the economic impact of the assumption concerning definition of costs on evaluation of the economic burden of diabetes. The proposed new cost-of-illness method provides specific insight for policy-makers to enhance diabetes management and assess the opportunity costs of diabetes complications' management programs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-017-0873-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28190188/,economics
"With the economic development of various countries and the deepening of population aging, health plays an increasingly important role in the macro-economy. How to meet the growing health needs as well as promote the economy has captured the attention of the world. Therefore, whether health investment can promote economic growth is an important theoretical and practical issue. An extended Mankiw-Romer-Weil model (MRW) with human health capital and population aging is employed to examine the impact on economic growth from population aging and health investment. On the basis of the theoretical model, this paper uses the LSDV and TSLS methods to carry out an empirical study based on cross-country panel data during the period 2000-2016. The empirical results show that health investment plays a significant role in promoting economic growth, and there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between population aging and economic growth. The impacts on economic growth from health investment and population aging can weaken each other. In addition, this paper also finds that health investment structure and the proportion of government health investment to total government spending can affect economic growth.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673245/,economics
"BACKGROUND: In X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), mutations in the MTM1 gene result in absence or dysfunction of myotubularin, a protein required for normal development, maintenance, and function of skeletal muscle. Extreme muscle weakness results in severe respiratory failure that is fatal for approximately half of XLMTM-affected children by age 18 months. Most surviving patients require invasive mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and wheelchairs for mobility, due to profoundly impaired motor function. Little is known about the costs of care for this rare disease. Currently, there are no approved therapies for XLMTM. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the direct medical costs and health care resource utilization (HRU) incurred by XLMTM patients and paid by commercial insurers. METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was conducted using the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus commercial database of adjudicated claims for more than 140 million individuals with commercial insurance coverage in the United States. An algorithm based on demographic information, diagnosis and procedure codes, and medications was used to identify XLMTM patients younger than aged 2 years during the study period from January 1, 2006, through September 30, 2018. All-cause direct medical costs and HRU during each month were calculated. Costs were grouped as inpatient hospital admissions (including the intensive care unit or neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]); emergency department visits; outpatient services (outpatient hospital visits, office visits, physician/provider office visits, ambulatory surgeries and procedures, laboratory tests, and imaging tests); and prescription medications. Monthly costs and HRU over time were stratified by age and use of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: 49 patients met the study criteria. All had at least 1 inpatient hospital admission, and 36 (73%) had at least 1 NICU stay. All patients received ventilation at some time during the study period, including 40 (82%) treated with invasive ventilation. Mean monthly per patient direct medical costs were highest in the first year of life ($74,831), including costs for inpatient admissions ($69,025), outpatient services ($5,266), and prescription medication ($540). Mean monthly costs were lower in the second, third, and fourth years of life ($23,207, $13,044, and $9,440, respectively). When annualized, these all-cause monthly medical costs totaled $897,978 per patient in the first year of life and nearly $1.5 million total for patients who survived the first 4 years of life. Costs were consistently highest when patients were receiving invasive ventilation and lowest when they were not receiving ventilation (i.e., before they started on ventilator support). CONCLUSIONS: This direct health care cost and HRU analysis demonstrates the substantial economic burden associated with XLMTM. Costs are highest in the first year of life and are particularly significant for patients receiving invasive ventilation.

"We analyse the properties of optimal price adjustment to hospitals when no lump-sum transfers are allowed and when prices differ to reflect observable exogenous differences in costs. We find that: (a) when the marginal benefit from treatment is decreasing and the cost function is the power function, price adjustment for hospitals with higher costs is positive but partial; if the marginal benefit is constant, the price is identical across providers; (b) if the cost function is exponential or it is separable in monetary and non-monetary costs (and linear in monetary costs), price adjustment is positive even when the marginal benefit is constant; (c) higher inequality aversion of the purchaser increases concentration in prices and lowers concentration in quantities; (d) if some dimensions of costs are private information, a higher correlation between the observable and unobservable cost component increases the optimal price for providers whose observable costs are above the average.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2010.09.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20952080/,economics
"While society would benefit from a reduced incidence of nosocomial infections, there is currently no direct reimbursement to hospitals for the purpose of infection control, which forces healthcare institutions to make economic decisions about funding infection control activities. Demonstrating value to administrators is an increasingly important function of the hospital epidemiologist because healthcare executives are faced with many demands and shrinking budgets. Aware of the difficulties that face local infection control programs, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) Board of Directors appointed a task force to draft this evidence-based guideline to assist hospital epidemiologists in justifying and expanding their programs. In Part 1, we describe the basic steps needed to complete a business-case analysis for an individual institution. A case study based on a representative infection control intervention is provided. In Part 2, we review important basic economic concepts and describe approaches that can be used to assess the financial impact of infection prevention, surveillance, and control interventions, as well as the attributable costs of specific healthcare-associated infections. Both parts of the guideline aim to provide the hospital epidemiologist, infection control professional, administrator, and researcher with the tools necessary to complete a thorough business-case analysis and to undertake an outcome study of a nosocomial infection or an infection control intervention.",https://doi.org/10.1086/521852,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17933084/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      This study investigates the possibility of multiple healthcare bubbles in the US healthcare market.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We first applied the newly developed Generalized Sup ADF test to locate multiple healthcare bubble episodes and then estimated the switching regression model specifying multiple healthcare bubble periods to evaluate to what extent macroeconomic variables (such as the interest rate, public debt, and fiscal deficit) and public financing healthcare programs influence the magnitude of healthcare bubbles in terms of the deviation of the medical care price inflation from either the overall price inflation or the money wage growth.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our results show that expansionary monetary and fiscal policies play important roles in determining the deviation of the medical care price inflation from the overall price inflation and that the net government debt has a positive impact on the deviation of the medical care price inflation from the money wage growth. The US healthcare market is now in the middle of a healthcare bubble, and this healthcare bubble has developed slowly and has lasted for approximately 3 decades, mirroring an increased societal preference for healthcare.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Policymakers in the US should cautiously consider the fact that healthcare bubbles must imply a misallocation of resources into healthcare, leading to negative consequences on the sustainability of the healthcare system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-015-0668-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25634500/,economics
"The paper studies the impact of alternative reimbursement systems on two provider decisions: whether to adopt a technology whose provision requires a sunk investment cost and how many patients to treat with it. Using a simple economic model we show that the optimal pricing policy involves a two-part payment: a price equal to the marginal cost of the patient whose benefit of treatment equals the cost of provision, and a separate payment for the partial reimbursement of capital costs. Departures from this scheme, which are frequent in DRG tariff systems designed around the world, lead to a trade-off between the objective of making effective technologies available to patients and the need to ensure appropriateness in use.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.10.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24268054/,economics
"The primary role of animal health economics is to inform decision-making by determining optimal investments for animal health. Animal health surveillance produces information to guide interventions. Consequently, investments in surveillance and intervention must be evaluated together. This article explores the different theoretical frameworks and methods developed to assess and optimise the spending of resources in surveillance and intervention and their technical interdependence. The authors present frameworks that define the relationship between health investment and losses due to disease, and the relationship between surveillance and intervention resources. Surveillance and intervention are usually considered as technical substitutes, since increased investments in surveillance reduce the level of intervention resources required to reach the same benefit. The authors also discuss approaches used to quantify externalities and non-monetary impacts. Finally, they describe common economic evaluation types, including optimisation, acceptability and least-cost studies.",https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.36.1.2609,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28926028/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The allocation of limited available healthcare resources demands an agreed rational allocation principle and the consequent priority setting. We assessed the association between economic evaluations of healthcare interventions published in Spain (1983-2008) and the disease burden in the population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Electronic databases (e.g., PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Knowledge, CRD, IME, IBECS) and reports from health technology assessment agencies were systematically reviewed. For each article, multiple variables were recorded such as: year and journal of publication, type of study, health intervention targetted, perspective of analysis, type of costs and sources of information, first author's affiliation, explicit recommendations aimed at decision-making, and the main disease cause to which the intervention was addressed. The following disease burden measures were calculated: years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and mortality by cause. Correlation and linear regression models were fitted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four hundred and seventy-seven economic evaluations were identified. Cardiovascular diseases (15.7%), infectious diseases (15.3%), malignant neoplasms (13.2%), and neuropsychiatric diseases (9.6%) were the conditions most commonly addressed. Accidents and injuries, congenital anomalies, oral conditions, nutritional deficiencies and other neoplasms were the categories with a lowest number of studies (0.6% for each of them). For the main disease categories (n = 20), a correlation was seen with: mortality 0.67 (p = 0.001), DALYs 0.63 (p = 0.003), YLLs 0.54 (p = 0.014), and YLDs 0.51 (p = 0.018). By disease sub-categories (n = 51), the correlations were generally low and non statistically significant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Examining discrepancies between economic evaluations in particular diseases and the overall burden of disease helps shed light on whether there are potentially over- and under-investigated areas. The approach taken could help policy-makers understand whether resources for economic evaluation are being allocated by using summary measures of population health.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-11-75,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21489236/,economics
"Productivity costs can strongly impact cost-effectiveness outcomes. This study investigated the impact in the context of expensive hospital drugs. This study aimed to: (1) investigate the effect of productivity costs on cost-effectiveness outcomes, (2) determine whether economic evaluations of expensive drugs commonly include productivity costs related to paid and unpaid work, and (3) explore potential reasons for excluding productivity costs from the economic evaluation. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify economic evaluations of 33 expensive drugs. We analysed whether evaluations included productivity costs and whether inclusion or exclusion was related to the study population's age, health and national health economic guidelines. The impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes was assessed in studies that included productivity costs. Of 249 identified economic evaluations of expensive drugs, 22 (9 %) included productivity costs related to paid work. One study included unpaid productivity. Mostly, productivity cost exclusion could not be explained by the study population's age and health status, but national guidelines appeared influential. Productivity costs proved often highly influential. This study indicates that productivity costs in economic evaluations of expensive hospital drugs are commonly and inconsistently ignored in economic evaluations. This warrants caution in interpreting and comparing the results of these evaluations.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-015-0685-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25876834/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Since 2012, the pharmaceutical reimbursement legislation in Germany has been applying external reference pricing that uses country-specific economic weights for foreign prices. However, the law does not specify technical details. Therefore, we develop a proposal on how national income weights can be taken into consideration.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      We develop weighting schemes that draw on gross domestic product per capita and adjust for purchasing power parities and exchange rates. In a second step, we populate the weighting schemes with economic data as well as with the price data for a pharmaceutical product (abiraterone acetate). Weighting the price of abiraterone acetate by gross domestic product per capita indicates potential price differentials of up to 43 percentage points across European prices in the German basket.
    


          Expert commentary:

"Several recent papers find evidence that global health aid is being diverted to reserves, education, military, or other sectors, and is displacing government spending. This is suggested to occur because ministers of finance have competing, possibly corrupt, priorities and deprive the health sector of resources. Studies have found that development assistance for health routed to governments has a negative impact on health spending and that similar assistance routed to private nongovernmental organizations has a positive impact. An alternative hypothesis is that World Bank and IMF macro-economic policies, which specifically advise governments to divert aid to reserves to cope with aid volatility and keep government spending low, could be causing the displacement of health aid. This article evaluates whether aid displacement was greater when countries undertook a new borrowing program from the IMF between 1996 and 2006. As found in existing studies, for each $1 of development assistance for health, about $0.37 is added to the health system. However, evaluating IMF-borrowing versus non-IMF-borrowing countries reveals that non-borrowers add about $0.45 whereas borrowers add less than $0.01 to the health system. On average, health system spending grew at about half the speed when countries were exposed to the IMF than when they were not. It is important to take account of the political economy of global health finance when interpreting data on financial flows.",https://doi.org/10.2190/hs.41.1.e,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21319721/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To model the financial effects of implementing a hospital-wide electronic medical record (EMR) system in a tertiary facility in Malawi.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We evaluated three areas of impact: length of stay, transcription time, and laboratory use. We collected data on expenditures in these categories under the paper-based (pre-EMR) system, and then estimated reductions in each category based on findings from EMR systems in the USA and backed by ambulatory data from low-income settings. We compared these potential savings accrued over a period of 5 years with the costs of implementing the touchscreen point-of-care EMR system at that site.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Estimated cost savings in length of stay, transcription time, and laboratory use totaled US$284 395 annually. When compared with the costs of installing and sustaining the EMR system, there is a net financial gain by the third year of operation. Over 5 years the estimated net benefit was US$613 681.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Despite considering only three categories of savings, this analysis demonstrates the potential financial benefits of EMR systems in low-income settings. The results are robust to higher discount rates, and a net benefit is realized even under more conservative assumptions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This model demonstrates that financial benefits could be realized with an EMR system in a low-income setting. Further studies will examine these and other categories in greater detail, study the financial effects at different levels of organization, and benefit from post-implementation data. This model will be further improved by substituting its assumptions for evidence as we conduct more detailed studies.",https://doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23144335/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Publicly funded biomedical and health research is expected to achieve the best return possible for taxpayers and for society generally. It is therefore important to know whether such research is more productive if concentrated into a small number of 'research groups' or dispersed across many.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We undertook a systematic rapid evidence assessment focused on the research question: do economies of scale and scope exist in biomedical and health research? In other words, is that research more productive per unit of cost if more of it, or a wider variety of it, is done in one location? We reviewed English language literature without date restriction to the end of 2014. To help us to classify and understand that literature, we first undertook a review of econometric literature discussing models for analysing economies of scale and/or scope in research generally (not limited to biomedical and health research).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found a large and disparate literature. We reviewed 60 empirical studies of (dis-)economies of scale and/or scope in biomedical and health research, or in categories of research including or overlapping with biomedical and health research. This literature is varied in methods and findings. At the level of universities or research institutes, studies more often point to positive economies of scale than to diseconomies of scale or constant returns to scale in biomedical and health research. However, all three findings exist in the literature, along with inverse U-shaped relationships. At the level of individual research units, laboratories or projects, the numbers of studies are smaller and evidence is mixed. Concerning economies of scope, the literature more often suggests positive economies of scope than diseconomies, but the picture is again mixed. The effect of varying the scope of activities by a research group was less often reported than the effect of scale and the results were more mixed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The absence of predominant findings for or against the existence of economies of scale or scope implies a continuing need for case by case decisions when distributing research funding, rather than a general policy either to concentrate funding in a few centres or to disperse it across many.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-016-0167-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28148292/,economics
"In this paper we consider the evolving American healthcare landscape and what it means for the use of economic evaluation of health interventions. We emphasise that use of economic evaluation in the US is unlikely to follow the European, Canadian or Australian models, which use cost effectiveness openly and explicitly, given the decentralised manner in which American healthcare is organised, financed and delivered, as well as different political systems and traditions, and cultural expectations and attitudes surrounding healthcare. However, this does not mean that considerations of value are absent. On the contrary, measurement of value remains near the top of the agenda among US policy makers. With a few exceptions, it just isn't playing out explicitly. In the American context, it means in part heightened debate over clinical evidence, and cost sharing. In some cases, payers are also considering economic evaluation more directly in coverage and reimbursement decisions and indirectly for clinical practice guidelines and best practice recommendations. A dramatic shift in policy towards cost effectiveness seems unlikely in the near future. Change will likely come in incremental fashion through experimentation, and perhaps in selected circumstances with public and private leaders willing to take the political risks. Conceivably, more substantial change will occur with a major shift in the political leadership in Washington, DC in the legislative or executive branches, and/or with an economic downturn and severe pressures on federal and state health budgets. However, a more likely outcome is the ongoing indirect use of cost-effectiveness information.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200624110-00012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17067200/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      The viability of trauma care as a surgical subspecialty is continually challenged by economic pressures related to reimbursement and opportunity costs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The literature was examined for articles focused on economic implications of a trauma focused surgical practice. Economic forecasting techniques were applied using a recalculating spreadsheet to examine charge and revenue generation comparing the effects of numerous variables affecting a trauma or general surgical service.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Elective general surgery practices derive the majority of revenues from procedural services, whereas trauma practices derive the majority of revenues from evaluation and management. Only centers with high admission volume can expect trauma surgeons to cover salary and expenses, predictably in association with high opportunity costs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The differences in time, effort, and patient volume required for a trauma surgeon to generate revenues comparable to an elective practice are dramatic.

Dyspepsia is a common problem where many sufferers do not seek healthcare. The clinical impact of the condition in the community and the economic costs were assessed using data from a large cross sectional survey. Dyspepsia may be costing society 1 billion pounds each year in the UK.

This role is shifting due to financial innovations, increased sustainability ambitions from large financial actors, and changes in international commodity markets. These changes are creating new global connections that potentially make financial markets, actors, and instruments important aspects of global environmental change. Despite this, the way financial markets and actors affect ecosystem change in different parts of the world has seldom been elaborated in the literature.

"In the absence of a perfect risk adjustment scheme, reimbursing health insurers' costs can reduce risk selection in community-rated health insurance markets. In this paper, we develop a model in which insurers determine the cost efficiency of health care and have incentives for risk selection. We derive the optimal cost reimbursement function, which balances the incentives for cost efficiency and risk selection. For health cost data from a Swiss health insurer, we find that an optimal cost reimbursement scheme should reimburse costs only up to a threshold.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1614,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20572200/,economics
"Turf battles have always existed in radiology although recently, we have observed an increase in their numbers and sometimes in their virulence. The main reasons for this increase include the relative plethora of physicians especially in industrialized areas, and the rapid progress and development of medical technology and minimally invasive techniques. These turf battles risk interfering with the over-all medical costs of local health care systems as they will inevitably lead to an increase in the concentration of complex medical devices controlled by different specialties which, in turn, will lead to an increase in number of invasive and noninvasive, diagnostic and therapeutic examinations. The only way that radiologists can hope to maintain control of today's techniques will be if they are willing to offer qualitative expertise in their procedures with full clinical, academic and technological backing similar, or superior to that presented by our respective clinical and surgical colleagues.

"Declines in economic activity and associated changes in human livelihood strategies can increase threats of species overexploitation. This is exemplified by the effects of economic crises, which often drive intensification of subsistence poaching and greater reliance on natural resources. Whereas development theory links natural resource use to social-economic conditions, few empirical studies of the effect of economic downturns on wild animal species have been conducted. I assessed the relations between African elephant (Loxodonta africana) mortality and human-caused wounds in Samburu, Kenya and (1) livestock and maize prices (measures of local economic conditions), (2) change in national and regional gross domestic product (GDP) (measures of macroeconomic conditions), and (3) the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (a correlate of primary productivity). In addition, I analyzed household survey data to determine the attitudes of local people toward protected areas and wild animals in the area. When cattle prices in the pastoralist study region were low, human-caused wounds to and adult mortality of elephants increased. The NDVI was negatively correlated with juvenile mortality, but not correlated with adult mortality. Changes in Kenyan and East Asian (primary market for ivory) GDP did not explain significant variation in mortality. Increased human wounding of elephants and elephant mortality during periods of low livestock prices (local economic downturns) likely reflect an economically driven increase in ivory poaching. Local but not macroeconomic indices explained significant variation in mortality, likely due to the dominance of the subsistence economy in the study area and its political and economic isolation. My results suggest economic metrics can serve as effective indicators of changes in human use of and resulting effects on natural resources. Such information can help focus management approaches (e.g., antipoaching effort or proffering of alternative occupational opportunities) that address variation in local activities that threaten plant and animal populations.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01713.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21790785/,economics
"OBJECTIVE As the cost of health care continues to increase, there is a growing emphasis on evaluating the relative economic value of treatment options to guide resource allocation. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of cranial neurosurgery procedures. METHODS The authors performed a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, focusing on themes of economic evaluation and cranial neurosurgery following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Included studies were publications of cost-effectiveness analysis or cost-utility analysis between 1995 and 2017 in which health utility outcomes in life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were used. Three independent reviewers conducted the study appraisal, data abstraction, and quality assessment, with differences resolved by consensus discussion. RESULTS In total, 3485 citations were reviewed, with 53 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Of those, 34 studies were published in the last 5 years. The most common subspecialty focus was cerebrovascular (32%), followed by neurooncology (26%) and functional neurosurgery (24%). Twenty-eight (53%) studies, using a willingness to pay threshold of US$50,000 per QALY or LY, found a specific surgical treatment to be cost-effective. In addition, there were 11 (21%) studies that found a specific surgical option to be economically dominant (both cost saving and having superior outcome), including endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke, epilepsy surgery for drug-refractory epilepsy, and endoscopic pituitary tumor resection. CONCLUSIONS There is an increasing number of cost-effectiveness studies in cranial neurosurgery, especially within the last 5 years. Although there are numerous procedures, such as endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke, that have been conclusively proven to be cost-effective, there remain promising interventions in current practice that have yet to meet cost-effectiveness thresholds.",https://doi.org/10.3171/2018.2.focus17792,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29712519/,economics
"At the 2019 World Health Assembly, a significant new resolution was agreed by most countries to start publicly sharing information on the real net prices they pay for medicines in their health systems. The resolution also includes provisions for countries to support other transparency activities. However, an additional proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to submit information on their internal sales figures, internal research and development costs, clinical trial costs and marketing costs for each individual medicine as a condition of registration, and for governments to publish this, was not agreed. Pressure for coordinated international action to increase the transparency of medicine prices and costs has been building for some time, as confidential discounts and rebates on prices of medicines are common. We argue that while it is possible that stakeholders may benefit to some extent from greater transparency on prices, several important policy and economic issues need to be carefully considered. Such transparency, combined with widespread use of international reference pricing, might undermine companies' differential pricing strategies, which are important in fostering wider access to medicines in low- and middle-income countries in particular, noting that access to medicines issues can occur in high-income countries as well. Moreover, there is a further risk that these types of proposals will lead to price fixing, less competition and higher prices than might otherwise be the case. The lack of any commitments in the resolution to greater transparency in payer decision-making processes also risks undermining the credibility of the resolution. The resolution and further transparency measures could have the potential to undermine patient access to medicines in the developing world, lead to higher prices in some markets and compromise long-term development of new medicines for future generations.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00877-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31956967/,economics

While potentially complex to apply, simple analyses are possible and qualitative lessons identified from its associated literature. Six lessons are identified which highlight the importance of considering pricing, population size, technology diffusion, evidence generation, and cost-effectiveness.

"For some years in Switzerland, in Germany and in the Netherlands some experience has been gathered with managed competition in health care. Efficiency reserves in the health service should be opened up by stronger competition orientation. Since the fundamental reform of the health insurance system in the Netherlands in 2006 the longest experience with the new governance model exists in this country. Health system experts in Germany and Switzerland maybe interested to include the experiences from the Netherlands into their further reforms. The analysis of relevant statistics and publications shows that, after 6 years, the results of the health reform in the Netherlands are to be called rather ""sobering up"". The competition activities of the health insurances, the insured persons and the providers are rather weak. However the expenditures for health are rising continuously. The intended goals of managed competition (reduction of costs and efficiency increase) could not be achieved in the Netherlands so far. The role of the health insurance companies and the competition readiness of the insured persons were obviously overrated, at the same time as well as the market power of the provider was rather underestimated.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1327740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23172597/,economics
"One of the major issues in the health care reform debate is the requirement that employers pay a portion of their employees' health insurance premiums. This paper examines the method for calculating the employer share of the health care premiums, as specified in the President's health care reform proposal. The calculation of the firm's cost of providing employee health care benefits is a function of marital status as well as the incidence of two-income earner households. This paper demonstrates that this method provides for lower than average premiums for married employees with no dependents in communities in which there is at least one married couple where both individuals participate in the labor market. This raises the non-wage labor costs of employing single individuals relative to individuals which are identical in every respect except their marital status. This paper explores the economic implications for hiring, as well as profits, for firms located in a perfectly-competitive industry. The results of the theoretical model presented here are clear. Under this proposed version of health care reform, ceteris paribus, firms have a clear preference for two-earner households. This paper also demonstrates that the incentive to discriminate is related to the size of the firm and to the size of the average wage of full-time employees for firms which employ fewer than fifty individuals. While this paper examines the specifics of President Clinton's original proposal, the conclusions reached here would apply to any form of employer-mandated coverage in which the premiums are a function of family status and the incidence of two-earner households.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4730040206,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7613598/,economics
"The purchaser-provider split is an integral part of the New Zealand and UK health care reforms. The split is seen as an opportunity to introduce competition by increasing the number of players. The assumption is that competition among providers, purchasers or indeed funders, increases efficiency and provides more consumer choice.

It examines evidence about the effects of formal contracting rather than the more traditional, informal negotiations that take place within a hierarchy. A number of potential problems with an indiscriminate provider split are highlighted and the conclusion drawn, that the outcome of such a split is likely to be more unpredictable than official expectations.

"There is an international call for countries to ensure universal health coverage. This call has been embraced in South Africa (SA) in the form of a National Health Insurance (NHI). This is expected to be financed through general tax revenue with the possibility of additional earmarked taxes including a surcharge on personal income and/or a payroll tax for employers. Currently, health services are financed in SA through allocations from general tax revenue, direct out-of-pocket payments, and contributions to medical scheme. This paper uses the most recent data set to assess the progressivity of each health financing mechanism and overall financing system in SA. Applying standard and innovative methodologies for assessing progressivity, the study finds that general taxes and medical scheme contributions remain progressive, and direct out-of-pocket payments and indirect taxes are regressive. However, private health insurance contributions, across only the insured, are regressive.

"The health care industry in general and hospitals in particular face an uncertain future as the federal government moved with unusual speed to enact sweeping Medicare legislation. These changing patterns of reimbursement reverse key economic incentives by which hospitals have been driven since the federal program for the elderly began 18 years ago.

These changes will present new challenges for the health care industry and will need innovative approaches to meet them. The prospective pricing system attempts to reverse the escalation of health care costs. Under this system, hospitals can realize greater profits only by reducing costs, not by incurring them.

"Most economic studies of picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) to date, including our own, have focused on the perspectives of the radiology department and its direct costs. However, many researchers have suggested additional cost savings that may accrue to the medical center as a whole through increased operational capacity, fewer lost images, rapid simultaneous access to images, and other decreases in resource utilization. We describe here an economic analysis framework we have developed to estimate these potential additional savings. Our framework is comprised of two parallel measurement methods. The first method estimates the cost of care actually delivered through online capture of charge entries from the hospital's billing computer and from the clinical practices' billing database. Multiple regression analyses will be used to model cost of care, length of stay, and other estimates of resource utilization. The second method is the observational measurement of actual resource utilization, such as technologist time, frequency and duration of film searches, and equipment utilization rates. The costs associated with changes in resource use will be estimated using wage rates and other standard economic methods. Our working hypothesis is that after controlling for the underlying clinical and demographic differences among patients, patients imaged using a PACS will have shorter lengths of stay, shorter exam performance times, and decreased costs of care. We expect the results of our analysis to explain and resolve some of the conflicting views of the cost-effectiveness of PACS.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03168132,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7612707/,economics
"The Swedish health system has entered a period of major structural transformation.

We argue that the limitations of existing planning and market based policy models can be overcome by an approach constructed upon 'planned markets'.

"Pharmacy costs are rising in excess of general and medical cost inflation, leading to calls for price and utilization controls by public and private payers. Such controls would be ineffective and counterproductive because they would attempt to reverse two profound, historic phenomena at work in the U. S. health care system. The added costs associated with breakthrough medicines represent a major structural shift from the provision of traditional medical services to the consumption of medical products; they also represent the creation of economic, social, and public health utility that we value as a society. The balkanization of medical delivery, institutionalized under traditional reimbursement strategies and galvanized by federal law, does not adequately account for or efficiently accommodate this rotation and increased utility. Federal and state laws regulating health insurance and provider risk sharing need to be revamped to encourage rather than constrain the social progress embodied in expensive, breakthrough medical technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.20.5.43,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11558720/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Due to escalating treatment costs, pharmacoeconomic analysis has been assigned a key role in the quest for increased efficiency in resource allocation for drug therapies in high-income countries. The extent to which pharmacoeconomic analysis is employed in the same role in low-income countries is less well established. This systematic review identifies and briefly describes pharmacoeconomic studies which have been conducted in Tanzania and further assesses their influence in the selection of essential medicines.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Pubmed, Embase, Cinahl and Cochrane databases were searched using ""economic evaluation"", ""cost-effectiveness analysis"", ""cost-benefit analysis"" AND ""Tanzania"" as search terms. We also scanned reference lists and searched in Google to identify other relevant articles. Only articles reporting full economic evaluations about drug therapies and vaccines conducted in Tanzania were included. The national essential medicine list and other relevant policy documents related to the identified articles were screened for information regarding the use of economic evaluation as a criterion for medicine selection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve pharmacoeconomic studies which met our inclusion criteria were identified. Seven studies were on HIV/AIDS, malaria and diarrhoea, the three highest ranked diseases on the disease burden in Tanzania. Six studies were on preventive and treatment interventions targeting pregnant women and children under the age of five years. The national essential medicine list and the other identified policy documents do not state the use of economic evaluation as one of the criteria which has influenced the listing of the drugs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Country specific pharmacoeconomic analyses are too scarce and inconsistently used to have had a significant influence on the selection of essential medicines in Tanzania. More studies are required to fill the existing gap and to explore whether decision-makers have the ability to interpret and utilise pharmacoeconomic evidence. Relevant health authorities in Tanzania should also consider how to apply pharmacoeconomic analyses more consistently in the future priority-setting decisions for selection of essential medicines.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-12-110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23016739/,economics
"This paper explores the economic implications of vouchers for chronic disease management with respect to achieving objectives of equity and efficiency. Vouchers as a payment policy instrument for health care services have a set of properties that suggest they may address both demand-side and supply-side issues, and contribute to equity and efficiency. They provide a means whereby health care services can be targeted at selected groups, enabling consumer choice of provider, and encouraging competition in the supply of health services. This analysis suggests that, when structured appropriately, vouchers can support consumers to choose services that will meet their health care needs and encourage competition among providers. Although they may not be appropriate across the entire health care system, there are features of vouchers that make them a potentially attractive option, especially for the management of chronic disease.",https://doi.org/10.1071/ah080451,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18666872/,economics
"Genetic disorders are clinically diverse and genetically heterogeneous, and are traditionally diagnosed based on an iterative phenotype-guided genetic assessment. However, such diagnostic approaches are long (diagnostic odysseys are common), misdiagnoses occur frequently, and diagnostic rates are low. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies may improve diagnostic rates and reduce the time to diagnosis for patients with suspected genetic disorders; however, MPS technologies are expensive and the health economic evidence base to support their use is limited. Several studies have compared the costs of traditional and MPS diagnostic pathways for patients with suspected genetic disorders, however costing methods and diagnostic scenarios are heterogeneous across studies. We conducted a literature review to identify and summarise information on these costing methods and diagnostic scenarios. Relevant studies were identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Library, from 2010 to 2018. Twenty-four articles were included in the review. We observed considerable heterogeneity across studies with respect to the selection of items of resource use used to derive total diagnostic pathway cost estimates. We also observed structural differences in the diagnostic scenarios used to compare the traditional and MPS diagnostic pathways. There is a need for guidelines on the costing of diagnostic pathways to encourage the use of consistent methods. More micro-costing studies that evaluate diagnostic service delivery are also required. Greater homogeneity in costing approaches would facilitate more reliable comparisons between studies and improve the transferability of cost estimates across countries.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00856-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31741314/,economics

"Systematic reviews of studies of effectiveness are the centrepiece of evidence-based medicine and policy making. Increasingly, systematic reviews of economic evaluations are also an expected input into much evidence-based policy making, with some health economists even calling for 'an economics approach to systematic review'. This paper questions the value of conducting systematic reviews of economic evaluations to inform decision making in health care. It argues that the value of systematic reviews of economic evaluations is usually undermined by three things. Firstly, compared with effectiveness studies, there is a much wider range of factors that limit the generalisability of cost-effectiveness results, over time and between health systems and service settings, including the context-dependency of resource use and opportunity costs, and different decision contexts and budget constraints. Secondly, because economic evaluations are more explicitly intended to be decision-informing, the requirements for generalisability take primacy, and considerations of internal validity become more secondary. Thirdly, since one of the two main forms of economic evaluation - decision analytic modelling - is itself a well-developed method of evidence synthesis, in most cases the need for a comprehensive systematic review of previous economic evaluations of a particular health technology or policy choice is unwarranted. I conclude that apparent 'meta-analytic expectations' for clear and widely applicable cost-effectiveness conclusions from systematic reviews of economic evaluations are optimistic and generally futile. For more useful insights and knowledge from previous economic studies in evidence-based policy making, a more limited range of reasons for conducting systematic reviews of health economic studies is proposed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1486,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19378354/,economics
"A well-established political economic literature has shown as multi-level governance affects the inefficiency of public expenditures. Yet, this expectation has not been empirically tested on health expenditures. We provide a political economy interpretation of the variation in the prices of 6 obstetric DRGs using Italy as a case study. Italy offers a unique institutional setting since its 21 regional governments can decide whether to adopt the national DRG system or to adjust/waive it. We investigate whether the composition and characteristics of regional governments do matter for the average DRG level and, if so, why. To address both questions, we first use a panel fixed effects model exploiting the results of 66 elections between 2000 and 2013 (i.e., 294 obs) to estimate the link between DRGs and the composition and characteristics of regional governments. Second, we investigate these results exploiting the implementation of a budget constraint policy through a difference-in-differences framework. The incidence of physicians in the regional government explains the variation of DRGs with low technological intensity, such as normal newborn, but not of those with high technological intensity, as severely premature newborn. We also observe a decrease in the average levels of DRGs after the budget constraint implementation, but the magnitude of this decrease depends primarily on the presence of physicians among politicians and the political alignment between the regional and the national government. To understand which kind of role the relevance of the political components plays (i.e., waste vs. better defined DRGs), we check whether any of the considered political economy variables have a positive impact on the quality of regional obstetric systems finding no effect. These results are a first evidence that a system of standardized prices, such as the DRGs, is not immune to political pressures.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.08.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28837864/,economics
"Rationale, aims, and objectives:
        
      
      There is at present no standard methodology to analyse the organizational impacts (OIs) of medical devices (MDs), and the field is still in its infancy. The aim of the present study was to assess, at a hospital level, the organizational and economic impacts of the introduction of a new MD, specifically the single-use flexible bronchoscope (FB).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Both the organizational and economic impacts of the single-use FB were evaluated in comparison with the reusable FB currently used as standard practice in our institution. First, process maps were created for both devices (reusable and single use). Based on the 12 types of OI defined by Roussel et al, interviews were conducted with all stakeholders, and the positive and negative aspects of the reusable and single-use processes were analysed. In a second step, microcosting analysis was conducted to determine the most economical balance in use of the 2 technologies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Process maps highlighted the complexity of the reusable device process when compared with the single-use device process. Among the 12 types of OI, the single-use FB process scored better than the reusable FB process in 75% of cases. With the ""fleet"" of 15 reusable FBs available in our institution, using single-use FBs would represent an extra cost of €154 per procedure. Single-use and reusable devices would have the same cost (€232 per procedure) with a theoretical annual activity of 328 bronchoscopies, which is much lower than our current activity (1644 procedures per year).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Organizational impact should be considered when assessing MDs. We show in this study that from an organizational viewpoint, there are many advantages to using single-use bronchoscopes. However, in economic impact, it is more cost-effective for our institution, with more than 1500 bronchoscopies performed annually, to use reusable devices.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.12904,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29573067/,economics
"This paper describes the methodology and presents preliminary results of an economic appraisal of a community based health care project in Kenya. Community health workers, trained for 12 weeks and deployed in two locations in Kenya's Western Province, act as first contact providers of basic health care and promoters of selected health, sanitation and nutrition practices. A Cost Benefit Analysis has been undertaken using the Willingness to Pay approach to compare the costs of the project and its benefits. The benefits are in the form of more easily accessible basic health care and are measured as consumer surplus accruing to the community. Gain in consumer surplus is consequent on the fall of average user costs and rise in utilisation of the project established points of first contact with primary health care. The argument for the economic viability of the project is validated by the large Net Present Value and Benefit Cost Ratio obtained for the whole of the project area and for the two locations separately. Although the evaluation technique used faces the problem of valuation of community time, aggregation of health care services at all points of first contact and the partial nature of cost benefit analysis evaluations, the results are strongly in favour of decentralisation of primary health care on similar lines in the rest of the country.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(84)90055-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6427933/,economics
"Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, changed the philosophical ground and rules and regulations that apply to low-income families with children who seek federal income support. TANF recipients have less flexibility in charting their life courses than AFDC recipients had. This article presents the findings of a study that investigated how TANF leavers, in comparison with AFDC leavers, fared economically after they left the cash assistance rolls. The major finding is that the income status of AFDC leavers increased considerably, but that of TANF leavers declined. The authors argue that TANF leavers fared less well economically because their decisions about whether to work, to engage in work-related activities, and to leave cash assistance rolls were under stricter control.

"Past empirical research has associated higher prices (and potentially profits) with less concentrated hospital markets. This has led to consternation among policymakers who must decide whether or not to apply traditional antitrust guidelines to hospital mergers. Due to the inherent flaws of accounting data, an 'event study' methodology is used to examine the effects of merger related announcements on the competitors' stock price returns. The results provide evidence that events which promote mergers increase the profits of competitors, while events which deter mergers decrease them. Furthermore, the greater the merger impact on local hospital markets, the stronger the effect.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(89)90022-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10296709/,economics
"Liver transplantation, a resource-intensive medical procedure, is under particular scrutiny in the current era of cost containment. There have been significant changes in treatment protocols over the past decade; however, information is limited on how these changes have affected the economics of liver transplantation. This study examines a time series from 1993 to 1999 in Medicare expenditures for liver transplantation. We estimated total first- and second-year expenditures, as well as expenditures 90 days pretransplantation. These expenditures included inpatient, outpatient, physician, home health, and hospice care; immunosuppression expenditures were not estimated. Average first-year expenditures (in year 2000 dollars) for liver transplantation, excluding immunosuppressives, decreased from 201,677 dollars in 1993 to 143,363 dollars in 1998. Inpatient costs accounted for the majority of total expenditures, decreasing from 179,306 dollars in 1993 to 120,445 dollars in 1998. Total days of hospitalization decreased from 56.7 days in 1993 to 42.2 days in 1998. The majority of hospitalization occurred during the first 90 days posttransplantation, but decreased from 44.4 days in 1993 to 29.4 days in 1999. Substantial cost reductions over this period were a result of reduced hospitalization and occurred while survival rates gradually improved.",https://doi.org/10.1053/jlts.2001.27868,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11679983/,economics
"The potential of preventive health-care services to save costs is intensely debated. On the one hand, a longer life span increases the probability that new and costly diseases occur. On the other hand, a higher life expectancy postpones the expensive last year of life (LYOL), which becomes cheaper with age. Using US expenditure data on survivors and decedents the paper shows that prevention in the general population causes expenditures for additional diseases that are larger than the savings from postponing the LYOL.

Although the recent consolidation among health insurers and rising premiums are indisputable, it is unlikely that consolidation has had any adverse effect on premiums nationwide, and Robinson provides no data that suggest otherwise. Specifically, he does not present data showing an increase in concentration in any relevant market during the past few years, let alone any resulting increase in premiums.

"We study the ever more integrated and ever more unbalanced trade relationships between European countries. To better capture the complexity of economic networks, we propose two global measures that assess the trade integration and the trade imbalances of the European countries. These measures are the network (or indirect) counterparts to traditional (or direct) measures such as the trade-to-GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and trade deficit-to-GDP ratios. Our indirect tools account for the European inter-country trade structure and follow (i) a decomposition of the global trade flow into elementary flows that highlight the long-range dependencies between exporting and importing economies and (ii) the commute-time distance for trade integration, which measures the impact of a perturbation in the economy of a country on another country, possibly through intermediate partners by domino effect. Our application addresses the impact of the launch of the Euro. We find that the indirect imbalance measures better identify the countries ultimately bearing deficits and surpluses, by neutralizing the impact of trade transit countries, such as the Netherlands. Among others, we find that ultimate surpluses of Germany are quite concentrated in only three partners. We also show that for some countries, the direct and indirect measures of trade integration diverge, thereby revealing that these countries (e.g. Greece and Portugal) trade to a smaller extent with countries considered as central in the European Union network.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083448,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24465381/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      New medical guideline recommendations for the treatment of major depressive disorders and regulative changes in the payment system of the German mental health care system warrant a revision of the framework in which electroconvulsive therapies (ECT) are offered.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cost structure analysis of the clinical resources essential for the ECT procedure was conducted and economically validated, exemplified at a German inpatient ECT treatment center.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The identification of directly attributable costs to the ECT intervention presupposes an accurate assessment of personnel engagement time and material consumption as well as an inclusion of overhead costs for the operational readiness of the hospital.

      The increasing importance of ECT in the clinical portfolio of therapy options demands an adequate refunding to support the expansion of this highly effective treatment.

"Objective:
        
      
      Much has been invested in big data analytics to improve health and reduce costs. However, it is unknown whether these investments have achieved the desired goals. We performed a scoping review to determine the health and economic impact of big data analytics for clinical decision-making.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the National Health Services Economic Evaluations Database for relevant articles. We included peer-reviewed papers that report the health economic impact of analytics that assist clinical decision-making. We extracted the economic methods and estimated impact and also assessed the quality of the methods used. In addition, we estimated how many studies assessed ""big data analytics"" based on a broad definition of this term.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search yielded 12 133 papers but only 71 studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria. Only a few papers were full economic evaluations; many were performed during development. Papers frequently reported savings for healthcare payers but only 20% also included costs of analytics. Twenty studies examined ""big data analytics"" and only 7 reported both cost-savings and better outcomes.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The promised potential of big data is not yet reflected in the literature, partly since only a few full and properly performed economic evaluations have been published.

"Economic recession prompts governments and health service ministers to seek increased efficiency in the production of hospital services in order to reconcile increasing demands with scarce resources. As one approach to the problem, the National Health Strategy is recommending pilot schemes, similar to those which have been introduced in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which involve the separation of purchaser from the provider of hospital services. It is argued that such separation, with the introduction of competition between providers of hospital services for contracts placed by publicly funded Area Health Boards, will increase efficiency and accountability in the use of resources. However, this argument ignores the hospital management's ability to keep costs down by altering the quality of hospital care in ways which are difficult to monitor by purchasing agencies. The article considers the effects the introduction of managed competition is likely to have on the quality of hospital services. The outcome is uncertain and competition may improve some dimensions of quality while jeopardizing others. If managed competition is tried in Australia, the opportunity should also be taken to examine its impact on the quality and outcomes of hospital care.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-6405.1992.tb00069.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1482723/,economics
"The overall objective of the given paper was to study the relationship of inbound medical tourism destinations with international tourism, economic development of recipient countries, the development of national healthcare systems and the institutional features of their environment, in terms of protection of the rights and freedoms of both business and citizens. In order to achieve this objective, the authors used methods of grouping, as well as correlation and regression analysis. The conducted study revealed that the formation of medical tourism destinations in countries with high social and economic development occurs in a balanced and unidirectional manner; simultaneously, one can see that the countries with ""new economic development"" form a sufficiently powerful and competitive market for medical tourism. All these countries have one thing in common: namely, there is a link between medical tourism and healthcare funding, international tourism and development of political and civil freedoms. Nevertheless, the noted aspects are not dominant enough, and this indicates that there are other internal factors and their configurations which shape a positive image of countries for medical tourism development.

"Individual states are actively weighing health care reform proposals and their potential impacts on many levels, including states' own economies. This article considers the effects on state economies of two instruments of health reform: employer mandates and cost containment. The literature suggests that an employer mandate will reduce employees' wages in the long run. In the short run, however, to compensate for the costs associated with mandated health care insurance for their employees, firms may raise their prices to consumers, reduce the number of employees, or allow a drop in profit margins. By increasing health care spending and the number of insured persons, mandates would also increase states' levels of economic activity. Though cost containment may dampen the stimulative effects of expanded coverage, resources not spent on health care as a result of effective cost containment might be redistributed to other sectors in a state's economy.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199721)16:2<219::aid-pam2>3.0.co;2-l,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10169691/,economics
"The relativity between economic development and occupational accidents is a debated topic.

Owing to fluctuation and growth scale characteristics of economic development, two dimensions including economic cycle and economic scale were divided. Results showed that there was no relationship between occupational accidents and economic scale during 1953-1978. Fatality rate per 10(5) workers was a conductive variable to gross domestic product per capita during 1979-2008. And economic cycle was an indicator to occupational accidents during 1979-2008.

"The Greek state has reduced their funding on health as part of broader efforts to limit the large fiscal deficits and rising debt ratios to GDP. Benefits cuts and limitations of Social Health Insurance (SHI) reimbursements result in substantial Out of Pocket (OOP) payments in the Greek population. In this paper, we examine social health insurance's risk pooling mechanisms and the catastrophic impact that OOP payments may have on insured's income and well-being. Using data collected from a cross sectional survey in Greece, we find that the OOP payments for inpatient care in private hospitals have a positive relationship with SHI funding.

"Without sufficient capital, the cost of engaging in sustainable clinical development of a drug or drug compound is exceedingly difficult. Fagnan, Fernandez, Lo, and Stein have proposed the securitization of a drug development ""mega-fund"" as a means of attracting capital from traditional long-term corporate bond investors to the clinical stage of drug development. Our contribution to this line of thinking is the modeling of the cash flows of such a biopharmaceutical mega-fund and their distributions over time to develop an innovative design of securities that control the timing risk of cash flows. This modeling offers a more efficient means of allocating the cash flows that the mega-fund consumes and generates, in an effort to lower the overall yields required to place the research-backed obligations. The new securities control the cash flow timing risk and the lower cost of funding ultimately means more funds are available to clinically test a treatment or cure. We obtain the cash flow profile of this new security, called 'the time-certain research-backed obligation', by isolating cash flows from two different time distribution of cash flow scenarios, so that investors will be assured of the time frame over which they will receive repayment of their investment. We have offered a security design that will lower the cost of funding the drug mega-fund. Success or failure of a drug is uncorrelated with the performance of the stock or bond markets, thus this asset class that is backed by a portfolio of drugs in the clinical stages of development should have little correlation with other asset markets, making them a valuable addition to diversified portfolios.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40290-020-00333-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32266695/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this paper is to examine the diffusion of a new surgical procedure with lower per-case cost and how its diffusion path is affected by the simultaneous introduction of a new drug class that may be an effective treatment to prevent surgery. In particular, we examine whether a process of technology substitution exists that influences the diffusion process of the surgical technology. Given their different cost implications, the interaction of these two different technologies, surgery and drug intervention, is relevant from the perspective of health expenditure. This is of particular interest in health care as technology adoption and diffusion has been cited as a major driver of expenditure growth. Such expenditure growth has been increasingly targeted through the use of market-orientated policy tools aimed at increasing efficiency. Our research is thus addressing the question of how economic incentives influence the diffusion process and we discuss the impact of a set of incentives on hospital behavior.
    


          Design/methodology:
        
      
      Hospital admission data for the financial years 1998/1999 to 2007/2008 in England are used to empirically test the contribution of prescription uptake and market-oriented reforms.

"Objective:
        
      
      This paper uses an economic model to compare three methods for stimulating quality improvement: payment incentives, competition for patients, and emphasis on professional ethics.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Use an economic model to simulate the impact on quality distortions (risk selection) of differences in payment incentives, competition for patients, and emphasis on professional ethics.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Health care policymakers in many countries seek to use incentives and competition to spur quality improvement. However, strong incentives often promote risk selection: insurers and providers financially benefit from distorting quality to attract profitable patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The analysis suggests that intense competition for patients and strong financial rewards for cost control can exacerbate quality distortions and compromise social solidarity.

      Carefully regulated competition and mixed forms of provider payment (risk sharing) appear to be the best options.

"The aims are to improve the efficiency in analyzing the regional economic changes in China's high-tech industrial development zones (IDZs), ensure the industrial structural integrity, and comprehensively understand the roles of capital, technology, and talents in regional economic structural changes. According to previous works, the economic efficiency and impact mechanism of China's high-tech IDZ are analyzed profoundly. The machine learning (ML)-based Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist index measurement algorithms are adopted to analyze the dynamic and static characteristics of high-tech IDZ's economic data from 2009 to 2019. Furthermore, a high-tech IDZ economic efficiency influencing factor model is built. Based on the detailed data of a high-tech IDZ, the regional economic changes are analyzed from the following dimensions: economic environment, economic structure, number of talents, capital investment, and high-tech IDZ's regional scale, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model further. Results demonstrate that the comprehensive economic efficiency of all national high-tech IDZs in China is relatively high. However, there are huge differences among different regions. The economic efficiency of the eastern region is significantly lower than the national average. The economic structure, number of talents, capital investment, and economic efficiency of the high-tech IDZs show a significant positive correlation. The economic changes in high-tech IDZs can be improved through the secondary industry, employee value, and funding input.

"Increasing attention has been paid in recent years to the problem of ""too much medicine"", whereby patients receive unnecessary investigations and treatments providing them with little or no benefit, but which expose them to risks of harm. Despite this phenomenon potentially constituting an inefficient use of health care resources, it has received limited direct attention from health economists. This paper considers ""too much medicine"" as a form of overconsumption, drawing on research from health economics, behavioural economics and ecological economics to identify possible explanations for and drivers of overconsumption. We define overconsumption of health care as a situation in which individuals consume in a way that undermines their own well-being. Extensive health economics research since the 1960s has provided clear evidence that physicians do not act as perfect agents for patients, and there are perverse incentives for them to provide unnecessary services under various circumstances. There is strong evidence of the existence of supplier-induced demand, and of the impact of various forms of financial incentives on clinical practice. The behavioural economics evidence provides rich insights on why clinical practice may depart from an ""evidence-based"" approach. Moreover, behavioural findings on health professionals' strategies for dealing with uncertainty, and for avoiding potential regret, provide powerful explanations of why overuse and overtreatment may frequently appear to be the ""rational"" choice in clinical decision-making, even when they cause harm. The ecological economics literature suggests that status or positional competition can, via the principal-agent relationship in health care, provide a further force driving overconsumption. This novel synthesis of economic perspectives suggests important scope for interdisciplinary collaboration; signals potentially important issues for health technology assessment and health technology management policies; and suggests that cultural change might be required to achieve significant shifts in clinical behaviour.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.01.020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28131024/,economics
"In recent years Germany has faced a growing economization and competition among hospitals. To protect their interests hospitals have to operate similarly to other commercial businesses. Academic hospitals face difficult circumstances in this competition. They have to facilitate research and education activities which require additional financial and personnel resources but also provide maximum acute care treatment at all times. This causes additional disadvantages in terms of financial resources, compared to private hospital chains. Such examples of financial shortcomings have led to the privatization of academic research centres in Germany. An alternative strategy to privatization of academic acute care hospitals is the change of their legal status into a capital company or into a foundation, according to US experiences. Public private partnerships (PPPs) may also represent a potential alternative, as they have already produced a growing number of successful examples in the public sector in Germany. Academic acute care hospitals can also choose a strategic reorganization of their targets, similar to their privately held competitors in the market. Potential economies in scale may be achieved in areas such as medical treatment, research and personnel planning.However, it is vital that academic acute care hospitals start to act productively and also individually. This article provides a number of managerial pathways and options to maintain and strengthen operational competitiveness.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-005-0860-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15942750/,economics
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The high costs of critical illness make economic outcomes important adjuncts to clinical outcomes in intensive care unit research. Costs are markedly different than other clinical outcomes, both in their measurement and their interpretation.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Although not necessarily patient-centered, economic outcomes are important to society. Costs are also useful summary measures of less-meaningful surrogates such as organ failures and lengths of stay. Limitations of economic outcomes, however, are numerous. Accurate measurement of costs in the ICU requires a thorough consideration of both direct and indirect costs, an understanding of the fixed and variable components of critical care expenditures, and knowledge that reducing resource use saves only the marginal, versus average, cost of ICU resources. Costs must also be interpreted alongside measures of effectiveness using proper modeling techniques. Interpretation can vary based on choice of effectiveness measure, perspective of the analysis, and societal and cultural norms.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      When correctly measured and interpreted alongside measures of effectiveness, costs are a useful and important outcome in critical care research.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccx.0000244117.08753.38,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16943716/,economics
"Schizophrenia is associated with a high familiar, social and economic burden. During the recent years early and specific intervention for first psychotic episodes has been suggested to improve the long term outcome of the disease. Despite the promising results obtained so far, early intervention is still scarcely applied. One major problem arises from the translation of research findings into stakeholder policies. In fact very few analyses of cost reductions obtained with early intervention have been reported. In the present paper we present a simulation of direct cost reduction that can be obtained with early intervention programmes. We based our analysis on available data about schizophrenia care costs in Italy and the expected cost reduction with the use of early intervention. We observed that the increase in costs due to the more intensive early intervention is largely compensated by the reduction of inpatient admissions with a reduction of direct costs of 6.01%. Despite the apparently small economic gain, early intervention offers more clinical and social benefits as it seems to be effective also in decreasing relapse rates, in improving the patients' quality of life and disability associated with psychosis and in increasing employment rates. Those indirect costs however are difficult to estimate and were not included in our model. In conclusion, our study supports the use of early intervention in schizophrenia, which could allow an outcome improvement with lower direct and indirect costs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2008.07.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18789855/,economics
"This paper explores the relationship between insurer competition and health plan benefit generosity by examining the impact of a regulatory change that caused the cancellation of 40% of the private plans in Medicare. I isolate cancellation's causal effect by using variation induced by insurers canceling all plans nationally. Results show that insurers in markets affected by cancellation reduced the benefit generosity of the plans remaining in the market. In the average market, out-of-pocket costs for a representative beneficiary enrolled in plans not directly affected by the policy increased by $91 annually. In the least competitive markets, out-of-pocket costs increased by roughly $64-$127 a year for enrollees in those plans. Meanwhile in the most competitive markets, benefit generosity barely changed. These findings have crucial implications for markets such as health insurance exchanges, as they suggest that plan generosity is degraded when competition declines.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2018.07.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30099217/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Illegal drugs consumption not only has a notable impact on the population's health, but also leads to major socio-economic costs. A significant characteristic of drug consumers is that the majority are of working age. The main aim of this study is to estimate the economic impact of drug consumption in Spain from a social perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cost-of-illness methodology is carried out and a distinction is made between health-related and non-health related direct costs, as well as indirect costs. Among the direct health care costs included are hospitalisations, primary and emergency care, support programmes and HIV outpatient care. Expenditure on prevention, law enforcement and research was included as direct costs falling outside of health care. Productivity losses due to premature deaths attributed to substance abuse and patient hospitalisation formed part of indirect costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For 2012, the total social cost related to drug consumption in Spain was somewhere between 1,436 and 1,651 million euros. The minimum cost of this consumption represented 0.14% of Spain's GDP for that year.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The present cost estimations provide a measure of the social burden that illegal drug consumption represents for the community. When it comes to allocating resources, the obtained results quantify the potential economic returns that could be achieved from effective policies and programmes aimed at reducing the consumption of illegal drugs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2017.03.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28475905/,economics
"There has been recent controversy about whether aid directed specifically to health has caused recipient governments to reallocate their own funds to non-health areas. At the same time, general budget support (GBS) has been increasing. GBS allows governments to set their own priorities, but little is known about how these additional resources are subsequently used. This paper uses cross-country panel data to assess the impact of GBS programmes on health spending in low-income and middle-income countries, using dynamic panel techniques to estimate unbiased coefficients in the presence of serial correlation. We found no clear evidence that GBS had any impact, positive or negative, on government health spending derived from domestic sources. GBS also had no observed impact on total government health spending from all sources (external as well as domestic). In contrast, health-specific aid was associated with a decline in health expenditures from domestic sources, but there was not a full substitution effect. That is, despite this observed fungibility, health-specific aid still increases total government health spending from all sources. Finally, increases in total government expenditure led to substantial increases in domestic government health expenditures.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23280730/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      To suggest a model for organizing and financing dental services for elderly people so that they have good access to services.
    


          Background:
        
      
      There are few studies on how dental services for elderly people should be organized and financed. This is surprising if we take into consideration the fact that the proportion of elderly people is growing faster than any other group in the population, and that elderly people have more dental diseases and poorer access to dental services than the rest of the adult population. In several countries, dental services are characterized by private providers who often operate in a market with competition and free price-setting. Private dentists have no community responsibility, and they are free to choose which patients they treat.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Literature review and critical reasoning.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In order to avoid patient selection, a patient list system for elderly people is recommended, with per capita remuneration for the patients that the dentist is given responsibility for. The patient list system means that the dentist assumes responsibility for a well-defined list of elderly people.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our model will lead to greater security in the dentist/patient relationship, and patients with great treatment needs will be ensured access to dental services.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-2358.2012.00646.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22582750/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      As a therapeutic class, vaccines are generally considered to be the health care intervention that provides the best value. In the pharmacoeconomic study of vaccines, it is common for researchers to conduct their analyses from a societal perspective, including direct medical costs as well as indirect costs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To discuss the data elements of pharmacoeconomic analyses of vaccines and review recently published analyses of emerging vaccines.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Myriad pharmacoeconomic analyses of vaccines currently in use have been conducted with varying results. A number of products, such as the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, and varicella vaccines, have been shown to be cost-effective from a societal perspective. Yet, other products, such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, have demonstrated less benefit than the cost of their respective vaccination programs. In general, these analyses can be used as a starting point to frame the benefits of specific vaccines in managed care with a balanced view of the necessary societal perspectives. To date, 6 pharmacoeconomic models have evaluated vaccination against human papillomavirus, with all demonstrating some cost benefit when the vaccine was used in female patients who fell within the indicated age range.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In general, as a therapeutic class, vaccines are extremely cost-effective agents. In addition, they are one of the few public health interventions that may directly lower medical costs. In conducting pharmacoeconomic analyses for agents in this class, researchers must consider costs incurred at both the health system and societal levels, as well as cost savings realized through the prevention of disease.",https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2007.13.s7-b.12,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17955624/,economics

"Despite earlier forecasts to the contrary, US health care spending growth has slowed in the past four years, continuing a trend that began in the early 2000s. In this article we attempt to identify why US health care spending growth has slowed, and we explore the spending implications if the trend continues for the next decade. We find that the 2007-09 recession, a one-time event, accounted for 37 percent of the slowdown between 2003 and 2012. A decline in private insurance coverage and cuts to some Medicare payment rates accounted for another 8 percent of the slowdown, leaving 55 percent of the spending slowdown unexplained. We conclude that a host of fundamental changes--including less rapid development of imaging technology and new pharmaceuticals, increased patient cost sharing, and greater provider efficiency--were responsible for the majority of the slowdown in spending growth. If these trends continue during 2013-22, public-sector health care spending will be as much as $770 billion less than predicted. Such lower levels of spending would have an enormous impact on the US economy and on government and household finances.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0289,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650316/,economics
"Energy plays a vital role in every economy, and it can be considered as a driving force of economic growth. The interrelations of energy with the other variables are also significant. As many developing countries rely on energy consumption, attracting energy-intensive facilities and installations is being satisfied with foreign direct investment (FDI) which can affect environment negatively. Accordingly, FDI can stimulate economic growth and the use of energy through economic growth indirectly affects foreign direct investment. Therefore, the primary purpose of this research is a comparative study on the impact of fossil and alternative energy consumption on foreign direct investment and economic growth. Thereby, we figure out the knowledge and technology transferring via FDI and its effect on economic growth, in which direction should it be, and how it should be managed to cause less environmental pollution. So, this research consists of 14 selected developing countries for 1986-2016. The results, estimated through seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), show that alternative energy and fossil fuels have a positive effect on the GDP with the coefficient values of 0.10 and 0.02, respectively. Still oil rents do not affect economic growth. The same findings have been reached with the FDI, and energy resources amplified the foreign investment on the cost of CO2 emissions. Also, these empirical results can be considered by policymakers to help them in creating the right policies for economic growth, adopting a strategy to use more alternative energy and investing in infrastructure to reduce the burning of fossil fuel.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11575-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33410035/,economics

"Using prices of hospital admissions and visits to five types of physicians, we analyzed how provider and insurer market concentration-as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)-interact and are correlated with prices. We found evidence that in the range of the Department of Justice's and Federal Trade Commission's definition of a moderately concentrated market (HHI of 1,500-2,500), insurers have the bargaining power to reduce provider prices in highly concentrated provider markets. In particular, hospital admission prices were 5 percent lower and cardiologist, radiologist, and hematologist/oncologist visit prices were 4 percent, 7 percent, and 19 percent lower, respectively, in markets with high provider concentration and insurer HHI above 2,000, compared to such markets with insurer HHI below 2,000. We did not find evidence that high insurer concentration reduced visit prices for primary care physicians or orthopedists, however. The policy dilemma that arises from our findings is that there are no insurer market mechanisms that will pass a portion of these price reductions on to consumers in the form of lower premiums. Large purchasers of health insurance such as state and federal governments, as well as the use of regulatory approaches, could provide a solution.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0552,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28874479/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) of the contralateral side during inguinal herniotomy via the hernia sack may avoid a subsequent second operation. Can this procedure however also reduce costs in the German health care system?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prospective analysis was performed of children operated on for inguinal hernia (IH) from March 2006 until October 2007. Using a linear mathematic model, the costs for different scenarios were calculated regarding the risk of contralateral IH. We thereby determined the incidence of contralateral IH at which DL became economically reasonable.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 123 unilateral IH operations (IH-OP) were performed in infants during the study period. Of these, 31 patients underwent DL of the contralateral side. Thirteen open hernia sacks were identified and ligated during the same operation. The following costs were calculated: (1) IH-OP without DL, 286 Euro, (2) IH-OP with contralateral DL, 338 Euro, (3) IH-OP with DL and synchronous ligation of the contralateral side, 393 Euro, and (4) metachronous operations of bilateral IH, 572 Euro. The incidence of contralateral hernia described in the literature ranges from 20% to 50%. Linear regression of the relative costs shows an economic advantage for DL with an incidence above 23%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Laparoscopic evaluation of the contralateral side in IH-OP is a rational approach for the patient and makes economic sense in the German health care system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00104-008-1512-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18392599/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Economic factors are a limiting factor toward the implementation of many health programmes and interventions. Economic evaluation has a great potential to contribute toward cost-effective healthcare delivery in South Africa. Little is known about the characteristics and quality of health economic (including pharmacoeconomic) research in South Africa.
    


          Objective and methods:
        
      
      This study assessed the state of health economic (including pharmacoeconomic) research in South Africa. PUBMED, MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, EconLit and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify health economic articles pertaining to South Africa published between 1 January 1977 and 30 April 2010. The searches used the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and text words alone and in combination: 'costs', 'health' and 'South Africa'. Our study included only original economic studies/analyses that pertained to South Africa, addressed a health-related topic, and had a statement or word in the title, abstract or keywords that indicated that an economic (including cost) analysis had been conducted. The study only included complete peer-reviewed publications (e.g. abstracts were excluded) that were reported in the English language. Two reviewers independently scored each article in the final sample using the data collection form designed for the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 108 studies investigating a wide variety of diseases were included in the study. These articles were published in 39 different journals mostly based outside of South Africa between 1977 and 2010. On average, each article was written by three authors. Most first authors had medical/clinical training and resided in South Africa at the time of publication of their study. Based on a 1-10 scale, with 10 indicating the highest quality, the mean quality score for all studies was 7.59 (SD 1.42) and half of the articles were of good quality (score 8-10) The quality of studies was related to the country in which the journal publishing the article was based (outside South Africa = higher); current residence of the primary author (outside South Africa = higher); method of economic analysis (economic evaluations higher than cost studies); type of data used (secondary higher than primary); primary training of the first author (health economics/pharmacoeconomics = higher); type of medical function (diagnosis = higher); study perspective (societal = higher); primary health intervention (pharmaceuticals = higher); study design (modelling = higher); number of authors (more = higher); and year of publication (more recent = higher) [p ≤ 0.05].
    


          Conclusion:

"This article examined the physician-patient agency relationship in the context of the prescription drug market in Japan. In this market, physicians often both prescribe and dispense drugs and can pocket profits in so doing. A concern is that, due to the incentive created by the mark-up, physicians' prescription decisions may be distorted. Empirical results using anti-hypertensive drugs suggest that physicians' prescription choices are influenced by the mark-up. However, physicians are also sensitive to the patient's out-of-pocket costs. Overall, although the mark-up affects prescription choices, physicians appear more responsive to the patient's out-of-pocket costs than their own profits from mark-up.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0741-6261.2007.00115.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18478669/,economics
"To help reduce child mortality and reach universal health coverage, Ghana extended free membership of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to children (under-18s) in 2008. However, despite the introduction of premium waivers, a substantial proportion of children remain uninsured. Thus far, few studies have explored why enrolment of children in NHIS may remain low, despite the absence of significant financial barriers to membership. In this paper we therefore look beyond economic explanations of access to health insurance to explore additional wider determinants of enrolment in the NHIS. In particular, we investigate whether social exclusion, as measured through a sociocultural, political and economic lens, can explain poor enrolment rates of children. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey of 4050 representative households conducted in Ghana in 2012. Household indices were created to measure sociocultural, political and economic exclusion, and logistic regressions were conducted to study determinants of enrolment at the individual and household levels. Our results indicate that socioculturally, economically and politically excluded children are less likely to enrol in the NHIS. Furthermore, households excluded in all dimensions were more likely to be non-enrolled or partially-enrolled (i.e. not all children enrolled within the household) than fully-enrolled. These results suggest that equity in access for socially excluded children has not yet been achieved. Efforts should be taken to improve coverage by removing the remaining small, annually renewable registration fee, implementing and publicising the new clause that de-links premium waivers from parental membership, establishing additional scheme administrative offices in remote areas, holding regular registration sessions in schools and conducting outreach sessions and providing registration support to female guardians of children. Ensuring equitable access to NHIS will contribute substantially to improving child health and reducing child mortality in Ghana.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.05.023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28575734/,economics
"Medicines expenditure consumes a significant proportion of public health expenditure in Thailand, where Universal Health Coverage has been in place since 2002. The National List of Essential Medicines has been successfully used as a pharmaceutical benefits package for all public health plans. All patients are eligible for all medicines included in the list free of charge by law. Health economic evaluation has been employed as a tool for the development of this list, including price negotiation of medicines before inclusion, especially of high-cost medicines or medicines with high budget implications. This paper illustrates the current process, mechanisms, and impact and informs of seven success factors that have contributed to the successful use of health economic evaluation in Thailand. These include strong political commitment, development of individual and institutional capacity, participation of all relevant stakeholders, establishment of standard methodological and process guidelines, consideration of several elements in the decision-making process, using evidence as a starting point rather than a deciding factor, and strong enforcement.

"We study physiotherapy providers' prices in repeated competitive biddings where multiple providers are accepted in geographical districts. Historically, only very few districts have rejected any providers. We show that this practice increased prices and analyze the effects the risk of rejection has on prices. Our data are derived from three subsequent competitive biddings. The results show that rejecting at least one provider decreased prices by more than 5% in the next procurement round. The results also indicate that providers have learned to calculate their optimal bids, which has also increased prices. Further, we perform counterfactual policy analysis of a capacity-rule of acceptance. The analysis shows that implementing a systematic acceptance rule results in a trade-off between direct cost savings and service continuity at patients' usual providers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-019-01143-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31902025/,economics
"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established health insurance marketplaces to allow consumers to make educated decisions about their health care coverage. During the first open enrollment period in 2013, the federally facilitated marketplace in Pima County, Arizona listed 119 plans, making it one of the most competitive markets in the country. This study compares these plans based on differences in consumer cost sharing, including deductibles, co-pays and premiums. Consumer costs were reviewed using specific cases including a normal delivery pregnancy, the management of Type II Diabetes, and the utilization of specialty drugs to treat Hepatitis C. Total cost of care was calculated as the cost of managing the condition or event plus the cost of monthly premiums, evaluated as a single individual age 27. Evaluating a plan on premium alone is not sufficient as cost sharing can dramatically raise the cost of care.

"BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing interest in expanding the use of real-world evidence (RWE) in economic assessments of pharmaceuticals, decision makers face uncertainty about how RWE should be used. OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of RWE in economic assessments of drugs by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER). METHODS: We reviewed cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses in final evidence reports of pharmaceuticals published by ICER. We calculated the total number of RWE uses and the proportion of model inputs informed by RWE per report. We classified model inputs into 15 categories based on their attributes and then examined what category each RWE informed to classify the reason for RWE use. Finally, we characterized RWE by study design, data source, and sponsor type. RESULTS: We identified 33 reports, all of which used RWE; the mean RWE use per report was 12 (range = 4-26). The average proportion of model inputs informed by RWE per report was 32.7%, but this proportion had a wide range (range = 4.1%-76.9%). RWE was most commonly used for disease progression inputs (28.7%) and health care resource utilization and costs (21.1%), but was rarely used for drug-specific clinical outcomes such as effectiveness (1.5%), adverse drug event rates (0.5%), and discontinuation rates (1.2%). The most frequently used study design was a retrospective cohort (56.6%), and the most frequently used data source was registry data (41.4%). About a third (30.2%) of RWE was industry-sponsored. CONCLUSIONS: RWE has been commonly used to inform pharmaceutical value assessments conducted by ICER. However, there has been relatively limited use of RWE to inform drug-specific effectiveness, despite calls for greater inclusion of RWE in value assessments for real-world drug effectiveness.

"The article analyzes the impact of recent economic changes accompanying the introduction of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) and ongoing cultural styles on the aged in Nigeria. It argues that during the one decade preceding the introduction of SAP in 1986, Nigeria experienced significant social and economic transformations made possible by the rise in oil prices in the 1970s. The introduction of SAP has also been accompanied by significant social, cultural, and economic changes. Here the effects of these changes on the situation of the elderly in Nigeria are examined using data pooled from observations and surveys in both the pre- and post-SAP years. Findings reveal that compared to the younger generations, the relative position of the elderly has not changed significantly, although the latter's position has deteriorated on dimensions such as access to economic and health resources. Regional and individual differentials in the situation of old people are significant during both the pre- and post-SAP era.",https://doi.org/10.2190/78cu-0auh-3bgw-pthn,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8821239/,economics
"In this paper we use published information to analyze the economic value of Direct to Consumer Advertising (DTCA). The reviewed research finds that DTCA leads to increased demand for the advertised drug and that the effect of the drug tends to be class-wide rather than product specific. There is weak evidence that DTCA may increase compliance and improve clinical outcomes. However, there is little research on the effect of DTCA on inappropriate prescribing or on the characteristics of patients who respond to treatment. On net, if the advertised drugs are cost effective on average and the patients using the drugs in response to the advertisement are similar to other users, DTCA is likely cost effective. Overall, the literature to date is consistent with the idea that DTCA is beneficial, but further research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1077558709335362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19423875/,economics

The results imply that changes in remuneration can have a large effect on the distribution of treatments. More generally, our results provide support for economic models that view financial incentives as important determinants of physician behaviour.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16958081/,economics
"Economic evaluation of telemedicine compares the costs and other consequences of delivering specific services through telemedicine vs. alternative means. Cost-effectiveness analysis, the most common method used for health issues, helps to assess whether the expected health benefits are worth the investment. Telemedicine raises particular challenges for evaluators: a telemedicine system may have multiple uses and joint costs that are difficult to apportion to one service, the existence of a system may lead to expanded indications for use, and technological change may rapidly make an evaluation outdated. Public and private regulation and payment may affect the diffusion of telemedicine. Uncertainty surrounds the policy of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is still formulating its position. Changes are underway in policies on licensure and credentialing of clinicians, which have traditionally been done by state and by site, to reflect the fact that telemedicine services may cross these regional boundaries. Lack of insurance coverage for telemedicine services has been considered an impediment to adoption with fee-for-service payment. Under capitation payment and fixed budgets, however, providers have financial incentives to use the most efficient method to deliver services, and these arrangements would favor telemedicine if it is the less costly alternative. If telemedicine were most costly and the health benefits worth the cost, monitoring might be needed to ensure the quality of care.",https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.1.1998.4.31,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9599071/,economics
"The authors examine the role and nature of the market for voluntary health insurance in the European Union and review the impact of public policy, at both the national and E.U. levels, on the development of this market in recent years. The conceptual framework, based on a model of industrial analysis, allows a wide range of policy questions regarding market structure, conduct, and performance. By analyzing these three aspects of the market for voluntary health insurance, the authors are also able to raise questions about the equity and efficiency of voluntary health insurance as a means of funding health care in the European Union. The analysis suggests that the market for voluntary health insurance in the European Union suffers from significant information failures that seriously limit its potential for competition or efficiency and also reduce equity. Substantial deregulation of the E.U. market for voluntary health insurance has stripped regulatory bodies of their power to protect consumers and poses interesting challenges for national regulators, particularly if the market is to expand in the future. In a deregulated environment, it is questionable whether this method of funding health care will encourage a more efficient and equitable allocation of resources.",https://doi.org/10.2190/k6bp-3h1r-l41m-hvge,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11915863/,economics
"When companies are faced with an upcoming and expected economic shock some of them tend to react better than others. They adapt by initiating investments thus successfully weathering the storm, while others, even though they possess the same information set, fail to adopt the same business strategy and eventually succumb to the crisis. We use a unique setting of the recent financial crisis in Croatia as an exogenous shock that hit the country with a time lag, allowing the domestic firms to adapt. We perform a survival analysis on the entire population of 144,000 firms in Croatia during the period from 2003 to 2015, and test whether investment prior to the anticipated shock makes firms more likely to survive the recession. We find that small and micro firms, which decided to invest, had between 60 and 70% higher survival rates than similar firms that chose not to invest. This claim is supported by both non-parametric and parametric tests in the survival analysis. From a normative perspective this finding could be important in mitigating the negative effects on aggregate demand during strong recessionary periods.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158782,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27508896/,economics

"A competitive market for individual health insurance tends to risk-adjusted premiums. Premium rate restrictions are often considered a tool to increase access to coverage for high-risk individuals in such a market. However, such regulation induces selection which may have several adverse effects. As an alternative approach we consider risk-adjusted premium subsidies. Empirical results of simulated premium models and subsidy formulae are presented. It is shown that sufficiently adjusted subsidies eliminate the need for premium rate restrictions and consequently avoid their adverse effects. Therefore, the subsidy approach is the preferred strategy to increase access to coverage for high-risk individuals.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(99)00028-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10977194/,economics

Our results indicate that insurers can greatly reduce this surplus by risk-adjusting the premium. We conclude that there need not be any substantial unavoidable consumer information surplus if consumers can choose whether to take a deductible for a one- or two-year health insurance contract with otherwise identical benefits. Therefore, adverse selection need not be a problem in a competitive insurance market with risk-adjusted premiums or vouchers and with such a consumer choice of health plan.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(94)00043-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10154655/,economics
"With green development becoming a global movement, environmental tax has been adopted by many governments to promote green development. This study analyzes the impact of environmental tax on green development by using a four-dimension dynamical system. The establishment of the system is based on the complex and dynamic interactions among economic development, pollution emissions, resources consumption, and environmental tax, where roles of environmental tax are reflected by the linear parameters. A theoretic analysis shows the complexity of the behavior of the system. Mainly, the existence of chaos is inferred by Lyapunov exponent spectrum and bifurcation diagram, then verified by the presence of a chaotic attractor. An empirical study of the green development dynamical system in China demonstrates the particular evolution paths of economic growth, pollution intensity, and resource intensity under different environmental tax parameters. Results indicate a robust beneficial role of environmental tax on green development. Furthermore, when an environmental tax is imposed, a firm government control, an active consumer awareness, an advanced technology level can stimulate economic growth, decrease pollution intensity, and control the resource intensity. But the government control has a stronger effect. This study provides a viable and promising approach to analyze the role of imposing an environmental tax on green development and may have potential application in other areas and countries.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221264,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31483801/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Current principles of cost-effectiveness analysis emphasize the rank ordering of programs by expected economic return (eg, quality-adjusted life-years gained per dollar expended). This criterion ignores the variance associated with the cost-effectiveness of a program, yet variance is a common measure of risk when financial investment options are appraised. Variation in health care program return is likely to be a criterion of program selection for health care managers with fixed budgets and outcome performance targets.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Characterizing health care resource allocation as a risky investment problem, we show how concepts of portfolio analysis from financial economics can be adopted as a conceptual framework for presenting cost-effectiveness data from multiple programs as mean-variance data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two specific propositions emerge: (1) the current convention of ranking programs by expected return is a special case of the portfolio selection problem in which the decision maker is assumed to be indifferent to risk, and (2) for risk-averse decision makers, the degree of joint risk or covariation in cost-effectiveness between programs will create incentives to diversify an investment portfolio.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The conventional normative assumption of risk neutrality for social-level public investment decisions does not apply to a large number of health care resource allocation decisions in which health care managers seek to maximize returns subject to budget constraints and performance targets. Portfolio theory offers a useful framework for studying mean-variance tradeoffs in cost-effectiveness and offers some positive predictions (and explanations) of actual decision making in the health care sector.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-200005000-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10800973/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Titmuss hypothesized that paying blood donors would reduce the quality of the blood donated and would be economically inefficient. We report here the first systematic review to test these hypotheses, reporting on both financial and nonfinancial incentives.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Studies deemed eligible for inclusion were peer-reviewed, experimental studies that presented data on the quantity (as a proxy for efficiency) and quality of blood donated in at least two groups: those donating blood when offered an incentive, and those donating blood with no offer of an incentive. The following were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO using OVID SP, CINAHL via EBSCO and CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, Econlit via EBSCO, JSTOR Health and General Science Collection, and Google.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The initial search yielded 1100 abstracts, which resulted in 89 full papers being assessed for eligibility, of which seven studies, reported in six papers, met the inclusion criteria. The included studies involved 93,328 participants. Incentives had no impact on the likelihood of donation (OR = 1.22 CI 95% 0.91-1.63; p = .19). There was no difference between financial and nonfinancial incentives in the quantity of blood donated. Of the two studies that assessed quality of blood, one found no effect and the other found an adverse effect from the offer of a free cholesterol test (β = 0.011 p < .05).
    


          Conclusion:

"Background:
        
      
      The Medicare program has initiated Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR), a bundled payment mandate for lower extremity joint replacements. We sought to determine the degree to which hospitals will invest in care redesign in response to CJR, and to project its economic impacts.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We defined 4 potential hospital management strategies to address CJR: no action, light care management, heavy care management, and heavy care management with contracting. For each of 798 hospitals included in CJR, we used hospital-specific volume, cost, and quality data to determine the hospital's economically dominant strategy. We aggregated data to assess the percentage of hospitals pursuing each strategy; savings to the health care system; and costs and percentages of CJR-derived revenues gained or lost for Medicare, hospitals, and postacute care facilities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the model, 83.1% of hospitals (range 55.0%-100.0%) were expected to take no action in response to CJR, and 16.1% of hospitals (range 0.0%-45.0%) were expected to pursue heavy care management with contracting. Overall, CJR is projected to reduce health care expenditures by 0.5% (range 0.0%-4.1%) or $14 million (range $0-$119 million). Medicare is expected to save 2.2% (range 2.2%-2.2%), hospitals are projected to lose 3.7% (range 4.7% loss to 3.8% gain), and postacute care facilities are expected to lose 6.5% (range 0.0%-12.8%). Hospital administrative costs are projected to increase by $63 million (range $0-$148 million).
    


          Conclusion:

"Background:
        
      
      Harsh funding cutbacks along with measures shifting cost to patients have been implemented in the Greek health system in recent years. Our objective was to investigate the evolution of financial protection of Greek households against out-of-pocket payments (OOPP) during the economic crisis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      National representative data of 33,091 households were derived from the Household Budget Surveys for the period 2008-2015. Financial protection was assessed by applying the approaches of catastrophic (CHE) and impoverishing OOPP. The determinants of CHE and impoverishment were examined using binary logistic regressions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      OOPP dropped by 23.5% in real values between 2008 and 2015, though their share in households' budget rose from 6.9% to 7.8%, with an increasing trend since 2012. These outcomes were driven by significant increases in medical products (20.2%) and inpatient (63%) OOPP, while outpatient expenses decreased considerably (-62%). Both incidence and overshoot of CHE were significantly exacerbated. The additional burden was distributed progressively, hence, financial risk inequalities decreased. Food poverty increased, but its incidence still remains at very low levels. Both incidence and intensity of relative poverty increased considerably in real terms. The poverty impact of OOPP is aggravating following 2012, and 1.9% of individuals were impoverished due to OOPP in 2015. Households of higher size, lower expenditure quintile, in urban areas, without disabled, elderly or young children members, and with younger or retired, better-educated breadwinners were significantly less vulnerable to CHE. Households in the lower-middle expenditure quintile, in rural regions, and with elderly members were facing higher risk, while wealthier families exhibited a considerable lower likelihood of impoverishment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The expansion of reliance of healthcare funding on OOPP has increased the financial risk and hardship of Greek households, which may disrupt their living conditions and create barriers to healthcare access.

This decline is related to fundamental changes in the economy and society, including sluggish productivity growth and employer assaults on workers' rights and protections. Productivity growth has slowed as companies no longer invest as much in equipment and training. Businesses have attacked workers' protections; unionization is down, and the minimum wage is worth about two-thirds as much as at its high point in the late 1960s.

"This paper analyzes the regulation of payment schemes for health care providers competing in both quality and product differentiation of their services. The regulator uses two instruments: a prospective payment per patient and a cost reimbursement rate. When the regulator can only use a prospective payment, the optimal price involves a trade-off between the level of quality provision and the level of horizontal differentiation. If this pure prospective payment leads to underprovision of quality and overdifferentiation, a mixed reimbursement scheme allows the regulator to improve the allocation efficiency. This is true for a relatively low level of patients' transportation costs. We also show that if the regulator cannot commit to the level of the cost reimbursement rate, the resulting allocation can dominate the one with full commitment. This occurs when the transportation cost is low or high enough, and the full commitment solution either implies full or zero cost reimbursement.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.04.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22835471/,economics
"Insurer participation in the Marketplaces for individual health insurance has been lower than expected, with large declines among states using the HealthCare.gov platform for policy years 2017 and 2018. Using HealthCare.gov enrollment data, we examined how insurer exits from the Marketplaces affected consumers' decisions to reenroll-that is, to continue Marketplace participation-in policy years 2015-18. Insurer exit was associated with increased likelihood of consumer disenrollment from Marketplace coverage. The increase was twice as large for unsubsidized consumers (18.3 percentage points) than for consumers who received subsidies in the form of Advance Premium Tax Credits (8.7 percentage points) and was largely independent of premium increases measured using the lowest-cost silver plan available. However, premiums increased more in areas affected by insurer exits than in unaffected areas, contributing to increased disenrollment among unsubsidized consumers in policy years 2016-18. These findings suggest that maintaining insurer participation could encourage continued enrollment in the Marketplaces, while preserving competition to limit premium increases.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05475,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31682484/,economics
"In order to examine the proportion of Medicare expenditures attributable to repeated admissions to the hospital, we assessed the frequency with which 270,266 randomly selected Medicare beneficiaries were readmitted after hospital discharge between 1974 and 1977. Twenty-two per cent of Medicare hospitalizations were followed by a readmission within 60 days of discharge. Medicare spent over $2.5 billion per year (24 per cent of Medicare inpatient expenditures) on such readmissions between 1974 and 1977. Analogous expenditures in 1984 could approach $8 billion. Even a small decrease in the readmission rate could result in substantial savings for the Medicare program. The recently enacted prospective-payment legislation, however, creates economic incentives that could increase readmission rates. Attempts by professional review organizations or others to develop hospital readmission profiles will need to control for patient and hospital characteristics that are correlated with the likelihood of readmission. Further study of such characteristics could help identify high-risk patient groups for whom increased outpatient supports might prove cost effective.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198411223112105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6436703/,economics
"One often-discussed option for controlling Medicare spending is to switch to a premium-support design. This would shift part of the risk of future health care cost increases from the federal treasury to Medicare beneficiaries. The economics of risk bearing suggests that this would be a mistake for three reasons. First, political decisions, not beneficiary choices, are the critical determinants of future health care costs. Second, only Congress can take into account the consequences of cost-containment decisions for both current and future generations. Third, the federal government is best able to diversify against the risk of future cost growth. Tying Medicare spending to the government's budget so that Congress sees the benefits of tough cost containment choices is the only way to force the program to make those politically difficult decisions. Economic efficiency is served by retaining the program's current structure instead of shifting risk to beneficiaries.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985703/,economics
"Parallel trade (PT) is a phenomenon that takes place at the distribution level, when a patented product is diverted from the official distribution chain to another one where it competes as a parallel distributor. Although some research regards PT in Europe as a 'common' form of arbitrage, there are reasons to believe that it is a type of 'regulatory arbitrage' that does not necessarily produce equivalent welfare effects. We draw upon a unique dataset that contains source country records of parallel imported medicine sales to the Netherlands for one therapeutic group (statins), that accounts for 5 % of the market at the time of study and it faced no generic competition. We estimate precise differences in prices and statutory distribution margins for each source country/product and, examine whether they drive parallel import flows using a gravity specification and an instrumental variable strategy. Our findings reveal that parallel imports are driven by cross-country differences in statutory distribution margins in addition to price differences, consistently with the hypothesis of PT being a type of 'regulatory arbitrage'.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-016-9199-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27878693/,economics

A model considering the extent of the monetary value is required. In this paper, a time-space model is proposed to elucidate the economic evolution of a market. Since the market activities are always open and realtime, the model of time and space is complicated. For the complexity, the probabilistic boundary and expectations under a low-possibility are introduced. Then, time and space cannot be separated and are defined as an asynchronous relationship. We apply this time-space model to the adaptive agent models of single and double auctions. The results of the numerical simulation indicate the intermittency in a broad area of the control parameter.

"Background:
        
      
      While management service organizations are new to dentistry, they have existed in medicine for many years. The author examined why they developed and what happened to three of them during 1998 to provide dentistry with insights into the future of dental management service organizations, or DMSOs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The author identified and examined the three largest physician practice management firms, or PPMs, as of early 1998. He monitored their stock prices and fiscal changes through 1998. He also tracked all publicly traded DMSOs for growth and evaluated their stock price changes.
    


          Results and conclusions:
        
      
      Economic pressures to control the cost of health care led to the development of organizational structures designed to increase the cost effectiveness of, and to control more variables associated with, health care delivery. The lure of vertical integration of health care delivery with the resultant control of multiple variables-including primary and specialty care, pharmaceuticals and hospitals-promoted the development of many PPMs and DMSOs, although many variables differ for dentistry.
    


          Practice implications:

"Efficiency as quantified and promoted by cost-effectiveness analysis sometimes conflicts with equity and other ethical values, such as the ""rule of rescue"" or rights-based ethical values. We describe the utilitarian foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis and compare it with alternative ethical principles. We find that while fallible, utilitarianism is usually superior to the alternatives. This is primarily because efficiency - the maximization of health benefits under a budget constraint - is itself an important ethical value. Other ethical frames may be irrelevant, incompatible with each other, or have unacceptable implications. When alternatives to efficiency are considered for precedence, we propose that it is critical to quantify the trade-offs, in particular, the lost health benefits associated with divergence from strict efficiency criteria. Using an example from HIV prevention in a high-prevalence African country, we show that favoring a rights-based decision could result in 92-118 added HIV infections per $100,000 of spending, compared to one based on cost-effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13010-019-0074-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30944009/,economics
"To date, a common view in the health economics literature is that the applicability of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is limited, due to the distribution problem which underlies its main method of valuation (e.g. willingness to pay). One view is that cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) overcomes these problems. We show that the same distributional concerns apply to non-monetary valuations of health consequences, to measurement of costs and to the decision rules of CEA. Hence adopting CEA over CBA cannot be justified on the basis of ""avoiding"" distributional considerations. The implications of our results are discussed, including alternative strategies for the use of ""income-based"" research findings in social decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11788982/,economics
"The problems with China's regional industrial overcapacity are often influenced by local governments. This study constructs a framework that includes the resource and environmental costs to analyze overcapacity using the non-radial direction distance function and the price method to measure industrial capacity utilization and market segmentation in 29 provinces in China from 2002 to 2014. The empirical analysis of the spatial panel econometric model shows that (1) the industrial capacity utilization in China's provinces has a ladder-type distribution with a gradual decrease from east to west and there is a severe overcapacity in the traditional heavy industry areas; (2) local government intervention has serious negative effects on regional industry utilization and factor market segmentation more significantly inhibits the utilization rate of regional industry than commodity market segmentation; (3) economic openness improves the utilization rate of industrial capacity while the internet penetration rate and regional environmental management investment have no significant impact; and(4) a higher degree of openness and active private economic development have a positive spatial spillover effect, while there is a significant negative spatial spillover effect from local government intervention and industrial structure sophistication.

"Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a recognised as the economic evaluation technique that accords most with the underlying principles of standard welfare economic theory. However, due to problems associated with the technique, economists evaluating resources allocation decisions in health care have most often used cost-effective analysis (CEA), in which health benefits are expressed in non-monetary units. As a result, attempts have been made to build a welfare economic bridge between cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). In this paper, we develops these attempts and finds that, while assumptions can be made to facilitate a constant willingness-to-pay per unit of health outcome, these restrictions are highly unrealistic. We develop an impossibility theorem that shows it is not possible to link CBA and CEA if: (i) the axioms of expected utility theory hold; (ii) the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) model is valid in a welfare economic sense; and (iii) illness affects the ability to enjoy consumption. We conclude that, within a welfare economic framework, it would be unwise to rely on a link between CBA and CEA in economic evaluations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(02)00011-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12349884/,economics
"This paper investigates the effects of changes in drug therapy on drug expenditure in Sweden between 1990 and 1995. Analyses have been carried out for both the aggregate drug expenditure and for drug expenditure according to the main groups of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Changes in expenditure can be divided into 3 components: the price of drugs, the quantity of drugs consumed and a residual. The size of the residual is a measure of the effect of changes in drug treatment patterns on drug expenditure. The aggregate real drug expenditure increased by 50% between 1990 and 1995. The relative retail price index of drugs decreased by 9% and the quantity index measured in terms of defined daily doses increased by 27%. The remaining residual increased by 30%. This implies that, if the residual had been unchanged during the study period, the aggregate expenditure would have increased by only 15%. The results also show that the size of the residual varies substantially across different ATC groups. The increase in the residual was largest for drugs that affect the nervous system (ATC group N); the residual increased by 86%. From the observed changes in residual values, it can be concluded that the underlying factor responsible for the increase in drug expenditure in Sweden is changes in drug therapy from less expensive to more expensive drugs.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199813010-00012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10176147/,economics
"Digital photography has become an economical and efficient substitute for conventional photography. We recently converted our resident clinical photography to a digital format to make archiving more efficient and to save the costs of clinical photography. We present a model that can be applied to a large group or academic practice outlining the conversion of our clinical photography to digital format. We discuss the costs that we have incurred during the past 3 years of conventional photography, the economic benefit and costs for conversion to digital, and a 5-year projection of savings using digital photography. We also discuss the advantages of digital photography and the equipment needed for the conversion.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00006534-200007000-00023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10883624/,economics
We conducted a literature review of studies of the economic burden of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. The annual direct medical cost of sexually transmitted diseases (including human immunodeficiency virus) has been estimated to be $16.9 billion (range: $13.9-$23.0 billion) in 2010 US dollars.,https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0b013e318223be77,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21934557/,economics
"Over the last decade or so, a number of healthcare systems have used economic evaluations as a formal input into decisions about the coverage or reimbursement of new healthcare interventions. This change in the policy landscape has placed some important demands on the design and characteristics of economic evaluation and these are increasingly evident in studies being presented to decision makers. One challenge has been to make studies specific to the context in which the decision is being taken. This is because of the inevitable geographical variation in many of the parameters within an analysis. There has been a series of important contributions to the published literature in recent years on how to quantify geographical heterogeneity within economic analyses based on randomised controlled trials. However, there are good reasons for economic evaluation for decision making to be undertaken using methods of evidence synthesis and decision analytical modelling, but issues of geographical variation still need to be handled appropriately. The key requirements of economic evaluations for decision making within healthcare systems can be defined as follows: (i) a design that meets the objectives and constraints of the healthcare system; (ii) coherent and complete specification of the decision problem; (iii) inclusion of all relevant evidence; and (iv) recognition and appropriate handling of uncertainty. In satisfying these requirements, it is important to be aware of variation between jurisdictions, and this imposes some important analytical requirements on economic studies. While many agencies have produced guidelines on preferred methods for healthcare economic evaluation, these exhibit considerable variation. Some of this variation can be justified by genuine differences between systems in clinical practice, objectives and constraints, while some of the variation relates to differences of opinion about appropriate analysis given methodological uncertainty. However, some of the variation in guidance is difficult to justify and is inconsistent with the aims and objectives of the systems the analyses are seeking to inform. Decision makers and analysts need to work together to streamline and where possible harmonise guidelines on methods for economic evaluations, whilst recognising legitimate variation in the needs of different healthcare systems. Otherwise, there is the risk that scarce resources will be wasted in producing country-specific analyses in situations where these are not justified. Expected value of information analyses are also emerging as a tool that could be considered by decision makers to guide their policy on the acceptance or non-acceptance of data from other jurisdictions.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200624110-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17067194/,economics
"The recent recession had a profound effect on all sectors of the US economy, including health care. We examined how private hospitals fared through the recession and considered how changes in their financial health may affect their ability to respond to future industry challenges. We categorized 2,971 private short-term general medical or surgical hospitals (both nonprofit and for-profit) according to their pre-recession financial health and safety-net status, and we examined their operational status changes and operating and total financial margins during 2006-11. We found that hospitals that were financially weak before the recession remained so during and after the recession. The total margins of nonprofit hospitals (both safety-net and other institutions) declined in 2008 but returned to their pre-recession levels by 2011. The recession did not create additional fiscal pressure on hospitals that were previously financially weak or in safety-net roles. However, both groups continue to have notable financial deficiencies that could limit their abilities to meet the growing demands on the industry.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0988,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24799569/,economics
"In Britain the last decade has witnessed the growth of the assistant practitioner (AP), a higher-level support worker role situated at band 4 of the NHS career framework, just below registered nurse. Various factors are given for the role's development but little analysis is provided as to the economic reasons for its implementation. With reference to the period since the economic crisis of 2007-08, this article proposes that the AP's implementation and function is influenced by the needs of the economy. With the UK Coalition Government refusing to increase public expenditure as it is thought detrimental to economic growth, emphasising instead the need to reduce public debt, an expansion of registered nurses is unlikely despite growing service user demand. As a result, the AP has become an important economic development in an attempt to maintain standards of nursing care in the present economic climate.",https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2015.24.4.214,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25723264/,economics
"Despite increasing interest in health economic evaluation, investigations have shown limited use by micro (clinical) level decision-makers. A considerable amount of health decisions take place daily at the point of the clinical encounter; especially in primary care. Since every decision has an opportunity cost, ignoring economic information in family physicians' (FPs) decision-making may have a broad impact on health care efficiency. Knowledge translation of economic evaluation is often based on taken-for-granted assumptions about actors' interests and interactions, neglecting much of the complexity of social reality. Health economics literature frequently assumes a rational and linear decision-making process. Clinical decision-making is in fact a complex social, dynamic, multifaceted process, involving relationships and contextual embeddedness. FPs are embedded in complex social networks that have a significant impact on skills, attitudes, knowledge, practices, and on the information being used. Because of their socially constructed nature, understanding preferences, professional culture, practices, and knowledge translation requires serious attention to social reality. There has been little exploration by health economists of whether the problem may be more fundamental and reside in a misunderstanding of the process of decision-making. There is a need to enhance our understanding of the role of economic evaluation in decision-making from a disciplinary perspective different than health economics. This paper argues for a different conceptualization of the role of economic evaluation in FPs' decision-making, and proposes Bourdieu's sociological theory as a research framework. Bourdieu's theory of practice illustrates how the context-sensitive nature of practice must be understood as a socially constituted practical knowledge. The proposed approach could substantially contribute to a more complex understanding of the role of economic evaluation in FPs' decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.03.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20382461/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      It is an unresolved issue as to whether cost-benefit analysis (CBA) or cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is the preferable analytical toolkit for use in health technology assessment (HTA). The distinction between the two and an expressed preference for CEA go back at least to 1980 in the USA and, most recently, a Harvard-based group has been reappraising the case for CBA.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This article seeks to answer the question: would the use of cost-benefit analysis rather than the more usual cost-effectiveness analysis be an improvement, specifically in appraising health and health-related investments in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) as they transition to Universal Health Coverage?.
    


          Methods/results:
        
      
      A selective literature review charts the welfare economics (welfarism and extra-welfarism) roots of both approaches. The principal distinguishing feature of the two is the monetary valuation of health outcomes under CBA compared with the use of health constructs such as the Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) or Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY) under CEA. The former enables direct comparison of the outcomes of health investments with the monetized outcomes of other investments, while the CEA approach facilitates direct comparisons with other health investments. Seven challenges in using CBA in developing countries arise, including ethical issues in outcome valuation, practical challenges in the acquisition of data, intrinsic bias in data on values, and some of the practical issues of implementation for either CBA or CEA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We conclude with a list of nine issues that both CBA and CEA need to settle if they are to be useful in LMICs. For the immediate future we judge CBA to be the less practicable.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30661640/,economics
"We present a model of dynamic monopoly pricing for a good that displays network effects. In contrast with the standard notion of a rational-expectations equilibrium, we model consumers as boundedly rational and unable either to pay immediate attention to each price change or to make accurate forecasts of the adoption of the network good. Our analysis shows that the seller's optimal price trajectory has the following structure: The price is low when the user base is below a target level, is high when the user base is above the target, and is set to keep the user base stationary once the target level has been attained. We show that this pricing policy is robust to a number of extensions, which include the product's user base evolving over time and consumers basing their choices on a mixture of a myopic and a ""stubborn"" expectation of adoption. Our results differ significantly from those that would be predicted by a model based on rational-expectations equilibrium and are more consistent with the pricing of network goods observed in practice.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319543110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24367101/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      High pharmaceutical prices and over-prescribing of high-priced pharmaceuticals in Chinese hospitals has long been criticized. Although policy makers have tried to address these issues, they have not yet found an effective balance between government regulation and market forces.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our objective was to explore the impact of market competition on pharmaceutical pricing under Chinese government regulation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from 11 public tertiary hospitals in three cities in China from 2002 to 2005 were used to explore the effect of generic and therapeutic competition on prices of antibiotics and cardiovascular products. A quasi-hedonic regression model was employed to estimate the impact of competition. The inputs to our model were specific attributes of the products and manufacturers, with the exception of competition variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our results suggest that pharmaceutical prices are inversely related to the number of generic and therapeutic competitors, but positively related to the number of therapeutic classes. In addition, the product prices of leading local manufacturers are not only significantly lower than those of global manufacturers, but are also lower than their non-leading counterparts when other product attributes are controlled for.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Under the highly price-regulated market in China, competition from generic and therapeutic competitors did decrease pharmaceutical prices. Further research is needed to explore whether this competition increases consumer welfare in China's healthcare setting.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-013-0099-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24190661/,economics
"In our voluntary insurance market, the greatest challenge is maintaining a balance between ""healthy"" and ""sick"" enrollees. Affordable coverage is possible only if many healthy persons purchase insurance, thereby cross-subsidizing high-risk persons. This is a particular challenge in the individual market, where healthy enrollees have no employer or tax subsidies to lower their premium costs. A successful individual market requires a delicate balance regarding the risk level of enrollees, the rates charged, and the regulations adopted. Small miscalculations in any of these areas can quickly result in spiraling premiums and plummeting coverage rates.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w2.377,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12703596/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Medical economics have significant impact on the entire country. The explosion in surgical techniques has been accompanied by questions regarding actual improvements in outcome and cost-effectiveness, such as the da Vinci(®) Surgical System (dVS) compared with conventional video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To establish a medical fee system for robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS), which is a system not yet firmly established in Japan.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study examines the cost benefit performance (CBP) based on medical fees compared with VATS and RATS under the Japanese National Health Insurance System (JNHIS) introduced in 2012.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The projected (but as yet undecided) price in the JNHIS would be insufficient if institutions have less than even 200 dVS cases per year. Only institutions which perform more than 300 dVS operations per year would obtain a positive CBP with the projected JNHIS reimbursement.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Thus, under the present conditions, it is necessary to perform at least 300 dVS operations per year in each institution with a dVS system to avoid financial deficit with current robotic surgical management. This may hopefully encourage a downward price revision of the dVS equipment by the manufacture which would result in a decrease in the cost per procedure.",https://doi.org/10.5761/atcs.oa.14-00076,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24835923/,economics
"Policy makers and analysts have been voicing concerns about the increasing concentration of health care providers and health insurers in markets nationwide, including the potential adverse effect on the cost and quality of health care. The Council of Economic Advisers recently expressed its concern about the lack of estimates of market concentration in many sectors of the US economy. To address this gap in health care, this study analyzed market concentration trends in the United States from 2010 to 2016 for hospitals, physician organizations, and health insurers. Hospital and physician organization markets became increasingly concentrated over this time period. Concentration among primary care physicians increased the most, partially because hospitals and health care systems acquired primary care physician organizations. In 2016, 90 percent of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) were highly concentrated for hospitals, 65 percent for specialist physicians, 39 percent for primary care physicians, and 57 percent for insurers. Ninety-one percent of the 346 MSAs analyzed may have warranted concern and scrutiny because of their concentration levels in 2016 and changes in their concentrations since 2010. Public policies that enhance competition are needed, such as stricter enforcement of antitrust laws, reducing barriers to entry, and restricting anticompetitive behaviors.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0556,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28874478/,economics
"This study investigates the impacts of globalization and financial development on environmental quality by incorporating energy consumption in the framework of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for selected countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the 1990-2014 time spans. The cross-sectional dependence is determined by using the cross-sectional dependence and Lagrange Multiplier (LM) methods. This study employs second-generation panel unit root tests to check the unit root properties and the Westerlund panel cointegration test to examine the long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. The results confirm the presence of cointegration in the long run. The Continuously Updated Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (CUP-FM) and Continuously Updated Bias-Corrected (CUP-BC) approaches are applied to investigate long-term output elasticities of the variables. The results show the stimulating role of energy consumption on Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study finds support for the EKC hypothesis as it relates to selected OECD countries. Globalization and financial development increase environmental quality by reducing CO2 emissions. The causal relationship reveals the presence of a bidirectional relationship between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The feedback causal effect runs between economic growth and CO2 emissions and between globalization and economic growth, while unidirectional causality runs from CO2 emissions to financial development, from economic growth to energy consumption, from energy consumption to financial development, from globalization to energy consumption, and from globalization to financial development. Policies that support green technology transfer among OECD countries, foreign direct investment in the renewable energy sector, financial development to support green infrastructure, and energy generation using renewable energy sources are recommended.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04761-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30900127/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the nature, scope and effectiveness of interventions to reduce the household economic burden of illness or injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We systematically reviewed reports published on or before 31 January 2014 that we found in the CENTRAL, CINAHL, Econlit, Embase, MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE and PsycINFO databases. We extracted data from prospective controlled trials and assessed the risk of bias. We narratively synthesized evidence.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Nine of the 4330 studies checked met our inclusion criteria – seven had evaluated changes to existing health-insurance programmes and two had evaluated different modes of delivering information. The only interventions found to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure significantly were those that eliminated or substantially reduced co-payments for a given patient population. However, the reductions only represented marginal changes in the total expenditures of patients. We found no studies that had been effective in addressing broader household economic impacts – such as catastrophic health expenditure – in the disease populations investigated.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In general, interventions designed to reduce the complex household economic burden of illness and injury appear to have had little impact on household economies. We only found a few relevant studies using rigorous study designs that were conducted in defined patient populations. The studies were limited in the range of interventions tested and they evaluated only a narrow range of household economic outcomes. There is a need for method development to advance the measurement of the household economic consequences of illness and injury and facilitate the development of innovative interventions to supplement the strategies based on health insurance.",https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.14.139287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25883403/,economics
"This contribution proposes a reimbursement scheme combining yardstick competition and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The scheme reimburses incurred cost while offering a bonus for resource savings relative to a DEA-based cost norm, providing firms with an incentive to minimize production cost. The individual yardsticks are as close as possible to the actual cost levels, minimizing informational rents of firms. The proposed reimbursement scheme is applied to the hospital sector in Saxony-Anhalt based on data collected in 1999.

"The effects of immunisation programmes that have existed for several decades in developed countries are demonstrated by the decrease and even eradication of smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps and hepatitis B. Cost, health policy and spontaneous evolution in the incidence of communicable diseases have a decisive influence on the use of a vaccine. Investment in vaccination policy has to be encouraged to maintain this progress made in the control of infectious diseases and to meet new challenges. Studies re-evaluating ongoing immunisation programmes are scarce. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that for vaccination against hepatitis B in professionally exposed at-risk populations, arguments for positive returns are consistent. The same holds for vaccination against S. pneumoniae and for influenza virus in the elderly. The results of the economic evaluation of revaccination against measles, when insufficient coverage exists, are inconclusive. Universal vaccination of children against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and of children of hepatitis B-positive mothers against hepatitis may require costs to be paid in order to gain extra health benefits.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199303040-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10146992/,economics
"The conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation is understood in portions of academia and sometimes acknowledged in political circles. Nevertheless, there is not a unified response. In political and policy circles, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is posited to solve the conflict between economic growth and environmental protection. In academia, however, the EKC has been deemed fallacious in macroeconomic scenarios and largely irrelevant to biodiversity. A more compelling response to the conflict is that it may be resolved with technological progress. Herein I review the conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation in the absence of technological progress, explore the prospects for technological progress to reconcile that conflict, and provide linguistic suggestions for describing the relationships among economic growth, technological progress, and biodiversity conservation. The conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation is based on the first two laws of thermodynamics and principles of ecology such as trophic levels and competitive exclusion. In this biophysical context, the human economy grows at the competitive exclusion of nonhuman species in the aggregate. Reconciling the conflict via technological progress has not occurred and is infeasible because of the tight linkage between technological progress and economic growth at current levels of technology. Surplus production in existing economic sectors is required for conducting the research and development necessary for bringing new technologies to market. Technological regimes also reflect macroeconomic goals, and if the goal is economic growth, reconciliatory technologies are less likely to be developed. As the economy grows, the loss of biodiversity may be partly mitigated with end-use innovation that increases technical efficiency, but this type of technological progress requires policies that are unlikely if the conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation (and other aspects of environmental protection) is not acknowledged.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01089.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19076872/,economics

"The economic pressure on German hospitals has increased considerably over the last years, mainly because of the introduction of a flat-rate payment system, and it will most likely further increase under the current demographic and political conditions. The growing dominance of economics in the inpatient sector increases the pressure on hospital staff and results in an increased volume of care (with sometimes inappropriate overtreatment) and uncontrolled rationing and a continuous struggle to maintain the quality of patient care. This development is not only alarming from an ethical perspective, but also impairs the hospital's economic performance. To counter the increasing economic pressure with ""more ethics"" does--according to the line of reasoning adopted in this article--not appear to be very successful. Rather, central ethical values in inpatient care have to become an integral part of hospital management. This value management first requires a clear definition of the normative standards, e.g. within a mission statement. Second, the realisation of the normative standards in routine inpatient care has to be systematically assessed, evaluated and managed. Since normative standards are difficult to measure objectively and on a quantitative scale, (repeated) surveys among hospital staff are the central instrument to secure the ""internal quality"" of the hospital. It appears very likely that more ethics in the hospital will pay off by improving its economic performance. The empirical proof for this conceptually extremely plausible hypothesis has yet to be provided.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2014.03.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24780715/,economics

"This analysis questions the appropriateness of inflation adjustment in analyses of provider behavior by comparing results from estimations using adjusted financial variables with those from estimations using unadjusted financial variables. Using Medicaid claims from 1984-1991, we explored the effects of Medicaid reimbursement increases on dentists' participation. Using results from inflation adjusted analyses, we would conclude that a 23% nominal increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates yields no increase in the number of Medicaid children seen by dentists. In contrast, estimations based on unadjusted reimbursement rates suggest that this same 23% nominal increase in reimbursement leads to an expected 16-person (15.4%) increase in the number of Medicaid patients seen per provider per year. These analyses demonstrate that results are sensitive to adjustment for inflation. While adjusting for inflation is a generally accepted practice in health services research, doing so without evidence that providers respond to adjusted reimbursement may be unjustified. More research is needed to determine the appropriateness of inflation adjustment in analyses of provider behavior, and the circumstances under which it should or should not be done.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00472-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10855926/,economics

      The ""fourth hurdle"" is very relevant in Hungary because many existing drugs are unevaluated and many new, expensive drugs are becoming available. On the other hand, the existing resources for health technology assessment, including economic evaluation, are quite limited. All the five issues are relevant in the Hungarian setting and were helpful in determining exactly how the ""fourth hurdle"" should be applied.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The most important issue seems to be that the implementation of the ""fourth hurdle"" needs to be achieved in a way consistent with the limited resources for HTA in Hungary. Specifically this means that, in setting priorities for drugs to evaluate, additional criteria need to be applied. In particular, priority should be given to assessing drugs that have been evaluated in other countries, because this affords the opportunity to adapt existing studies or models to the Hungarian situation.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462304001151,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15446763/,economics
"In recent years, China has gradually become one of the countries with the largest levels of foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI has played a significant role in promoting Chinese economic development, and the FDI technology spillover effect is one of the core forces driving China towards reaching new growth milestones. Therefore, due to the country's interest in development, there is competition for FDI throughout China. However, the existing imperfect environmental protection system cannot prevent FDI from flowing into China's highly polluting and resource-intensive industrial chain, possibly causing serious environmental problems. Therefore, the topic of properly introducing foreign capital to promote development and effectively end China's current environmental pollution crisis has become a research focus. To explore FDI's impact on China's economic growth, technological innovation, and environmental pollution, we use Chinese provincial panel data for 2004-2016 to construct a dynamic panel simultaneous-equation model. Considering the interrelationships between the equations, we construct economic models of economic growth, technological innovation, and pollution emissions, and incorporate them into the same research system for generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. Our results show that FDI has a significant and positive direct impact on China's economic growth and technological innovation, and can furthermore have a significant pull effect on the domestic economy through the backward spillover channel. At the same time, FDI has a direct and significant impact on the increase in regional waste-water discharge, while exhibiting a pollution halo effect on the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions directly. In addition, we observe ""benign feedback mechanism"" between technological innovation output and these three types of pollution, namely SO2 emission, COD emissions, and ammonia and nitrogen discharge.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33802232/,economics
"This paper analyses the link between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth and their subsequent impact on environmental pollution in China. The simultaneous equation method was used with data from 31 provinces in China covering the period between 1995 and 2016. The findings indicate that the effect of FDI on economic growth, industrial structure, and environmental pollution control positively impacts on China's industrial pollution control and environmental conditions, implying that China should encourage foreign capital investments that come with advanced production technology and green production processes. This will enhance efficient resource utilization, adherence to environmental standards, and ensuring sustainable economic development.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04991-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30972677/,economics
"Proposals to contain health care costs often draw from 1 of 2 primary policy approaches-price regulation or market competition. These approaches are often viewed as in conflict, even though some health economists have long argued that they may be compatible, and desirable, given the unique characteristics of health care markets.

"Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) represent almost half the world's population, and all five national governments recently committed to work nationally, regionally, and globally to ensure that universal health coverage (UHC) is achieved. This analysis reviews national efforts to achieve UHC. With a broad range of health indicators, life expectancy (ranging from 53 years to 73 years), and mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (ranging from 10·3 to 44·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths), a review of progress in each of the BRICS countries shows that each has some way to go before achieving UHC. The BRICS countries show substantial, and often similar, challenges in moving towards UHC. On the basis of a review of each country, the most pressing problems are: raising insufficient public spending; stewarding mixed private and public health systems; ensuring equity; meeting the demands for more human resources; managing changing demographics and disease burdens; and addressing the social determinants of health. Increases in public funding can be used to show how BRICS health ministries could accelerate progress to achieve UHC. Although all the BRICS countries have devoted increased resources to health, the biggest increase has been in China, which was probably facilitated by China's rapid economic growth. However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic growth, India, has had the least improvement in public funding for health. Future research to understand such different levels of prioritisation of the health sector in these countries could be useful. Similarly, the role of strategic purchasing in working with powerful private sectors, the effect of federal structures, and the implications of investment in primary health care as a foundation for UHC could be explored. These issues could serve as the basis on which BRICS countries focus their efforts to share ideas and strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60075-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24793339/,economics

Further, renewable energy consumption, environmental technology, and financial development improve environmental quality by decreasing carbon emissions. We suggest that changes in policymaking to promote sustainable economic growth and environmental quality should be prevent environmental degradation, but also inspire greater investments in new technologies and energy expertise in the renewables industry.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33237920/,economics

The incidence, prevalence and type of sports injuries vary among men and women as well as age groups. It is usually difficult to examine these different aspects of sports injuries due to insufficient data. This study argues that sport injuries can be considered as an important economic burden in terms of the direct and indirect costs it bears. As a result, strong and effective strategies are needed to prevent sports injuries. Sports medicine has also been attracted increasing attention in recent years, particularly.

"Scholars have raised concerns that cutbacks on government health expenditure (GHE) during recessions may jeopardise population health. The present research investigates the extent to which population health outcomes are affected by responses of GHE to business cycles, i.e., cyclicality of GHE. We estimate GHE cyclicality by regressing detrended GHE on detrended gross domestic product (GDP). Our analysis of data for 1995 through 2014 from 135 developing countries shows that mean cyclicality is 0.61, or that a one percent deviation from the GDP trend is positively correlated with a 0.61 percent deviation from the GHE trend. Further, countries in which GHE is less procyclical appear to have shorter life expectancies and higher adult mortality rates. These results suggest that reducing procyclicality of GHE by protecting GHE in bad times may generate substantial health gains. Importantly, our results show that increasing the weight of social security funds in health budgets, and improving institutional quality, can be critical to breaking the procyclical pattern of GHE.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.11.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482387/,economics
"Given that overweight is clearly associated with increased risk of many major chronic diseases, the United States could have saved approximately $45.8 billion or 6.8% of health care expenditures in 1990 alone if obesity were prevented. The question then arises, economically and socially, what is a healthy body weight? Using a prevalence-based approach to cost of illness, we estimated the economic costs (1993 dollars) associated with illness at different strata of body mass indexes (BMIs, in kg/m2) and varying increments of weight gain to address the questions: At what body weight do we initiate preventive services? What are the direct costs associated with weight gain? Second, using the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we evaluated the marginal increase in certain social indexes reflective of functional impairment and morbidity (ie, restricted-activity days, bed days, and work-loss days) as well as physician visits associated with different strata of BMI. With respect to economic and social indexes, a healthy body weight appears to be a BMI < 25, and weight gain should be kept to < 5 kg throughout a lifetime.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/63.3.466,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8615344/,economics
"Since 1995 Belgian sickness funds are partially financed through a risk adjustment system and are held partially financially responsible for the difference between their actual and their risk-adjusted expenditures. However, they did not get the necessary instruments for exerting a real influence on expenditures and the health insurance market has not been opened for new entrants. At the same time the sickness funds have powerful tools for risk selection, because they also dominate the market for supplementary health insurance. The present risk-adjustment system is based on the results of a regression analysis with aggregate data. The main proclaimed purpose of this system is to guarantee a fair treatment to all the sickness funds. Until now the danger of risk selection has not been taken seriously. Consumer mobility has remained rather low.

"Health interventions have two major downstream cost effects, savings from reducing morbidity and expenditures from living longer. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many economic evaluations, particularly those that are trial-based, do not include health care costs from living longer. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the bias from excluding life extension costs in economic evaluations. To this end, the impact of health changes on savings from preventing disease and costs of living longer was examined in the US Medicare population between 1998 and 2004. A state transition decision model with two health states (alive and dead) was built from an extended payer's perspective. It used Medicare expenditure data on survivors and decedents. Health changes were measured in terms of both morbidity and mortality reduction. The analysis shows that life extension costs cancel out savings from reducing morbidity. Users of economic evaluations may use this finding to estimate the bias when life extensions costs are not included in the analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2164,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23418021/,economics
"In this paper, the relationship between willingness to pay for health changes, the human-capital approach, and the costs that should be included in a cost-benefit analysis of a health care programme are analysed. The costs that should be included are defined as the change in consumption minus the change in production of the individual that receives a health care programme. The size of these external costs differs depending on the institutional arrangements in society. It is shown that the net production version of the human-capital approach is an estimation of the external costs. The human-capital approach can thus be given a theoretical foundation in cost-benefit analysis if it is used to estimate the external costs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(96)00815-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10158268/,economics

"This paper has two purposes. The first purpose is methodological and aims to extend previous work on efficiency analysis by implementing a multiple-output stochastic ray frontier production function model. This model generalizes the single-output stochastic frontier model to multiple-input, multiple-output technologies and allows simultaneous estimation of technical efficiency and analysis of influential variables on efficiency. The second, empirical, purpose is to test for existence and magnitude of the effect of purchaser/provider split combined with new reimbursement schemes on technical efficiency in the Swedish public hospital system. The analysis is carried out with a panel data set covering the total population of 26 Swedish County Councils from 1989 to 1995. Our empirical results support the frontier model specification and indicate that output-based reimbursement improves technical efficiency. The potential saving in costs due to a switch from budget-based allocation to output-based allocation is estimated to be almost 10%.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199903)8:2<151::aid-hec411>3.0.co;2-q,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10342728/,economics
"This paper focuses on the concept of a sustainable city and its theoretical implications for the Italian urban system. Urban sustainability is based on positive interactions among three different urban subsystems: social, economic and physical, where social well-being coexists with economic development and environmental quality. This utopian scenario does not appear in the existing cities. The aesthetic quality of natural and man-made environment is often associated with marginality and poverty, labor market variety and urban efficiency coexisting with pollution, criminality and high settlement costs. Moreover, since each city differs institutionally, historically, culturally and economically, few attempts have been implemented to build a comparative synthetic vision of the urban sustainability in different cities. The interactions among these selected systems are complex and unpredictable and present the opportunity for a new methodology of scientific investigation: the connectionistic approach. The dual aim of this study is to: investigate the underlying relationships among the three subsystems with a set of social, economic and physical attributes of the chief towns of a Province in Italy and ; verify if this underlying structure could reproduce the heterogeneity of urban realities, allowing one to distinguish groups of cities with different assets or drawbacks in their sustainability. The Data Base (DB), composed of 43 attributes for 95 cities, was processed by Self-Reflexive Neural Networks (SRNN) (Buscema, 1995). These Networks are a useful instrument of investigation and analogic questioning of the Data Base. Once the SRNN has learned the structure of the weights from the DB, by querying the network with the maximization or minimization of specific groups of attributes, it is possible to read the related properties and to rank the cities' urban profile.",https://doi.org/10.3109/10826089809115896,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9533741/,economics
"The sixth section of our Special Task Force (STF) report reviews and comments on recent US-oriented value assessment frameworks, specifically those published by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We review published commentaries that address the validity, reliability, and conceptual underpinnings of these frameworks. We find common themes of critique regarding the strengths and limitations across frameworks. Particular shortcomings of some frameworks pose greater threats to their face validity and utility compared with others. The most significant limitations include lack of clear perspective (e.g., patient vs. health plan) and poor transparency in accounting for costs and benefits. We then review how each framework adheres to core STF recommendations, with particular emphasis on whether the framework can be used to support coverage decisions by health insurers, and whether it adheres to core principles of cost-effectiveness analysis. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Research framework most closely adheres to core STF recommendations. Others have significant limitations that vary widely from framework to framework. We also review how the frameworks follow STF recommendations for addressing potentially relevant issues beyond cost-effectiveness analysis - for example, equity in resource allocation and patient heterogeneity. Finally, we review whether and how each framework uses value thresholds and addresses affordability concerns.

"This article considers the ethical implications of prospective payment from the perspective of physicians and other health care practitioners. It focuses on the argument that prospective payment creates ethical conflict by giving physicians an economic incentive to do less for their patients. This argument is criticized in two respects. First, available evidence is reviewed which suggests that the incentives actually created by different prospective payment schemes and their effect on ""optimal"" patterns of practice is uncertain. Further, it is pointed out that ethical conflict originates in the dual role of physicians as agents and suppliers of service. Recognizing that such conflict exists under any payment mechanism, a better focus for the ethical evaluation of prospective payment is suggested that considers whether the incentive to do less is likely to have adverse effects on physician decisions, relative to decisions made under other payment mechanisms.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jmp/12.2.107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3598410/,economics

Surprisingly, though, it was found that the frequency in which those in nursing homes ""spend-down"" their assets and income, thus becoming eligible for Medicaid, is much lower than others have calculated. This may be due in part to the fact that a large proportion of the elderly are already eligible for Medicaid when they begin their nursing-home stays.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-198912000-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2512461/,economics
"The development and application of an economic model designed to assess the specific costs and benefits of health plan coverage of smoking-cessation programs involving sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride are described. A cohort of 100,000 employees or health plan members and 60,000 adult dependents was followed from the start of the model to either retirement at age 65 or death at age 85. The model was used to compare outcomes for coverage versus no coverage of sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride as a component of a smoking-cessation benefit under four managed care plan scenarios and four employer scenarios. For the managed care scenarios involving coverage of bupropion sustained-release the overall decrease in health care costs over a 20-year period ranged from $7.9 million to $8.8 million; for every dollar spent covering smoking cessation, $4.10-$4.69 in health care costs was saved. For the employer scenarios, health care costs over 20 years decreased by $8.3 million to $14.0 million, and smoking-related indirect costs decreased an additional $5.1 million to $7.7 million; for every dollar spent covering smoking cessation, $5.04-$6.48 was saved.

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) has serious negative effects on health-, social-, and work-related issues for the patients and their families, thus causing significant socioeconomic burden. The objective of the study was to determine healthcare costs and indirect illness costs in MS patient in a national sample. We used all national records from the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2006), and identified 10,849 MS patients which were compared with 43,396 randomly age-, sex- and social matched citizens. Healthcare sector costs included frequencies and costs of hospitalizations and weighted outpatient use, frequencies of visits and hospitalizations and costs from primary sectors, and the use and costs of drugs. Productivity costs (the value of lost productivity from time off from work due to illness) and all social transfer payments were also calculated. Patients with MS had significantly higher rates of health-related contact and medication use and very low employment rate which incurred a higher socioeconomic cost. The income level of employed MS patients was significantly lower than that of control subjects. The annual total health sector costs and productivity costs were €14,575 for MS patients vs. €1163 for control subjects (p<0.001), corresponding to an annual mean excess health-related cost of €13,413 for each patient with MS. In addition, the MS patients received an annual mean excess social transfer income of €6843. MS present social and economical consequences more than eight years before diagnosis. We conclude that MS causes major socioeconomic consequences for the individual patient and for society. Productivity costs are a far more important economic factor, especially due to reduced employment, which are enhanced by the early age of diagnose onset.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2011.05.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21669514/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To compare prices of medicines, both originators and generics, in New Zealand and 16 European countries.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ex-factory price data as of December 2012 from New Zealand and 16 European countries were compared for a basket of 14 medicines, most of which were at least partially funded by the state in the 17 countries. Five medicines had, at least in some countries, generic versions on the market whose prices were also analyzed. Medicine price data for the 16 European countries were provided by the Pharma Price Information service. New Zealand medicine prices were retrieved from the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule. Unit prices converted into euro were compared at the ex-factory price level.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the 14 medicines surveyed, considerable price differences at the ex-factory price level were identified. Within the European countries, prices in Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Spain ranked at the lower end, whereas prices in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden were at the upper end. The results for New Zealand compared with Europe were variable. New Zealand prices were found in the lowest quartile for five medicines and in the highest quartile for seven other products. Price differences between the originator products and generic versions ranged from 0% to 90% depending on the medicine and the country.
    


          Conclusions:

      The qualitative study is including 13 semi-structured interviews of healthcare experts, municipality authority, health care providers, negotiator of the troika agreement, hospital managers, health economists and elderly. A content analysis was performed to evaluate the interviews applying Nvivo2011 software. The barriers identified were clustered towards the five areas of the 'Conceptual framework on health care access' by Levesque et al. (Int J Equity Health 12:18, 2013).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Healthcare access for the elderly was found inadequate in four areas of the framework: availability; appropriateness; approachability; and affordability. The fifth area on acceptability was not identified since the study neither followed a gender nor ethnic specific purpose. The main identified barriers were: current financial situation and pension cuts; insufficient provision and increased user fees in primary care; inadequate design and availability of hospital care service; lack of long-term care facilities; increased out-of-pocket-payment on pharmaceuticals; limitations in exemption allowances; cuts in non-emergent health transportation; increased waiting time for elective surgery; and poor unadapted housing conditions for elderly.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The health reforms and health budget cuts in the MoU implemented as part of the troika agreement have been associated with increasing health inequalities in access to healthcare services for the elderly population. The majority of responses disclosed an increasing deficiency across the entire National Health Service (NHS) to collaborate, integrate and communicate between the different healthcare sectors for providing adequate care to the elderly. An urgent necessity of restructuring the health care system to adapt towards the elderly population was implied.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-017-0679-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29070050/,economics
"The Ocean State antitrust case illustrates the operation of the competitive marketplace in health insurance. Blue Cross, the dominant firm in Rhode Island, responded competitively to the entrance of a new competitor, Ocean State, in three ways: 1) a most-favored-nation clause, 2) creation of a PPO offering similar benefits as Ocean State, and 3) an adverse selection policy. These actions are assessed to be legitimate competitive responses and the decisions of the higher courts overturning the jury verdict against Blue Cross are supported.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00004010-199502010-00008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7744607/,economics
"Context:
        
      
      Medicaid expansion has costs and benefits for states. The net impact on a state's budget is a central concern for policy makers debating implementing this provision of the Affordable Care Act. How large is the state-level fiscal impact of expanding Medicaid, and how should it be estimated?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We use Michigan as a case study for evaluating the state-level fiscal impact of Medicaid expansion, with particular attention to the importance of macroeconomic feedback effects relative to the more straightforward fiscal effects typically estimated by state budget agencies. We combine projections from the state of Michigan's House Fiscal Agency with estimates from a proprietary macroeconomic model to project the state fiscal impact of Michigan's Medicaid expansion through 2021.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      We find that Medicaid expansion in Michigan yields clear fiscal benefits for the state, in the form of savings on other non-Medicaid health programs and increases in revenue from provider taxes and broad-based sales and income taxes through at least 2021. These benefits exceed the state's costs in every year.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While these results are specific to Michigan's budget and economy, our methods could in principle be applied in any state where policy makers seek rigorous evidence on the fiscal impact of Medicaid expansion.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-7893555,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31675091/,economics
"If competition proposals are to reduce the cost of medical care, they must put forth a key role for physicians. Inasmuch as most proposals focus on the market for health insurance, the means by which policies that affect insurers are transmitted to influence the behavior of physicians are largely unknown. A larger role for competing groups of physicians is hypothesized, but the effect of competition is likely to be uneven, because group practice physicians are already in the most competitive areas of the country in terms of the density of physicians, and very few are in rural areas or in other particular regions of the country. Little evidence can be found in productivity or fee level differences between solo and group practice physicians. Thus the value of promoting group medical practices rests on their ability to reduce the use of expensive medical care. It is possible that competition proposals may not hold much promise for reducing costs. Nevertheless, they may still be worthwhile if they are better able than the present system to translate the wishes of consumers into the services of providers.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-198401000-00008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6694463/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      This systematic review sought to assess the costs and benefits of interventions preventing hospital-acquired infections and to evaluate methodological and reporting quality.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We systematically searched Medline via PubMed and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database from 2009 to 2014. We included quasi-experimental and randomized trails published in English or German evaluating the economic impact of interventions preventing the four most frequent hospital-acquired infections (urinary tract infections, surgical wound infections, pneumonia, and primary bloodstream infections). Characteristics and results of the included articles were extracted using a standardized data collection form. Study and reporting quality were evaluated using SIGN and CHEERS checklists. All costs were adjusted to 2013 US$. Savings-to-cost ratios and difference values with interquartile ranges (IQRs) per month were calculated, and the effects of study characteristics on the cost-benefit results were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our search returned 2067 articles, of which 27 met the inclusion criteria. The median savings-to-cost ratio across all studies reporting both costs and savings values was US $7.0 (IQR 4.2-30.9), and the median net global saving was US $13,179 (IQR 5,106-65,850) per month. The studies' reporting quality was low. Only 14 articles reported more than half of CHEERS items appropriately. Similarly, an assessment of methodological quality found that only four studies (14.8%) were considered high quality.

"Background:
        
      
      Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments are one of the major sources of financial support for hospitals providing care to low-income patients. However, Medicaid DSH payments will be redirected from hospitals to subsidize individual health insurance purchase through US national health reform.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The purpose of this study is to examine the association between Medicaid DSH payment reductions and nursing-sensitive and birth-related quality of care among Medicaid/uninsured and privately insured patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Economic theory of hospital behavior was used as a conceptual framework, and longitudinal data for California hospitals from 1996 to 2003 were examined. Hospital-fixed effects regression models were estimated. The unit of analysis is at the hospital level, examining 2 aggregated measures based on the payer category of discharged patients (ie, Medicaid/uninsured and privately insured).
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      The overall study findings provide at best weak evidence of an association between net Medicaid DSH payments and hospital quality of care for either Medicaid/uninsured or the privately insured patients. The magnitudes of the effects are small and only a few have significant DSH effects.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although this study does not find evidence suggesting that reducing Medicaid DSH payments had a strong negative impact on hospital quality of care for Medicaid/uninsured or privately insured patients, the results are not necessarily predictive of the impact national health care reform will have. Research is necessary to monitor hospital quality of care as this reform is implemented.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000000114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24714580/,economics
"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is now accepted as equally valid as the use of a standard access in some areas of surgery. It is not possible to decide whether this access is economically worthwhile and if so for whom without a full economic cost-benefit analysis, which must take account of the hospital's own characteristics in addition to the cost involved for surgery, staff, infrastructure and administration. In summary, the main economic advantage of MIS lies in the patient-related early postoperative results, while the main disadvantage is that the operative material costs are higher. At present, the payment made for each procedure performed under the DRG system includes 14-17% of the total cost for materials, regardless of the access route and of the technical sophistication of the operation. The actual material costs are greater by a factor of 2-50 for MIS than for a conventional procedure. The task of the hospital is thus to lower the costs for material and infrastructure; that of industry is to offer less expensive alternatives; and that of our politicians, to implement better remuneration of the material costs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00104-007-1345-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17457551/,economics

      Three levels of impact are reported and discussed in this commentary: the 'macro' level, which corresponds to policy(ies); the 'meso' level, which corresponds to nursing services and nursing education; and the 'micro' level, which deals with clinical practice and education, where interactions between patients and nurses and/or students take place.
    


          Background:
        
      
      The Italian economy is showing some signs of recovery after the worst economic crisis of past decades. However, these signs are still quite weak and insufficient to declare that the country is finally coming out of it.
    


          Key issues:

"Objectives:
        
      
      The underlying mechanisms through which family economic adversity influences child health are less understood. Taking a process-oriented approach, this study examined maternal mental health and investment in children, child health insurance, and child healthcare as mediators linking family economic hardship (FEH) to child health.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A structural equation modeling was applied to test the hypothesized mediating model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After adjustment for sociodemographic risk factors, results revealed: (1) a significant direct path linking FEH to poor child health (effect size = .372), and (2) six significant mediating pathways (total effect size = .089). In two mediating pathways, exposures to FEH undermined mothers' mental health: in the first pathway poor maternal mental health led to decreased parental investment, which, in turn, contributed to poor child health, whereas in the second pathway the adverse effect of poor maternal mental health was cascaded through child unmet healthcare need, which resulted in poor child health. One pathway involved child insurance status, where the effect of FEH increased the likelihood to be uninsured, which led to unmet healthcare need, and, in turn, to poor health. Three pathways involved preventive care: in one pathway FEH contributed to poor preventive care, which led to unmet healthcare need and then to poor health; in the other two pathways where poor preventive care respectively gave rise to decreased investment in children or poor maternal mental health, which further contributed to poor child health.

"Background:
        
      
      The consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased mortality from chronic diseases, and as a result, it has been classified by the World Health Organization as carcinogenic (processed meat) and probably carcinogenic (red meat) to humans. One policy response is to regulate red and processed meat consumption similar to other carcinogens and foods of public health concerns. Here we describe a market-based approach of taxing red and processed meat according to its health impacts.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We calculated economically optimal tax levels for 149 world regions that would account for (internalize) the health costs associated with ill-health from red and processed meat consumption, and we used a coupled modelling framework to estimate the impacts of optimal taxation on consumption, health costs, and non-communicable disease mortality. Health impacts were estimated using a global comparative risk assessment framework, and economic responses were estimated using international data on health costs, prices, and price elasticities.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The health-related costs to society attributable to red and processed meat consumption in 2020 amounted to USD 285 billion (sensitivity intervals based on epidemiological uncertainty (SI), 93-431), three quarters of which were due to processed meat consumption. Under optimal taxation, prices for processed meat increased by 25% on average, ranging from 1% in low-income countries to over 100% in high-income countries, and prices for red meat increased by 4%, ranging from 0.2% to over 20%. Consumption of processed meat decreased by 16% on average, ranging from 1% to 25%, whilst red meat consumption remained stable as substitution for processed meat compensated price-related reductions. The number of deaths attributable to red and processed meat consumption decreased by 9% (222,000; SI, 38,000-357,000), and attributable health costs decreased by 14% (USD 41 billion; SI, 10-57) globally, in each case with greatest reductions in high and middle-income countries.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Including the social health cost of red and processed meat consumption in the price of red and processed meat could lead to significant health and environmental benefits, in particular in high and middle-income countries. The optimal tax levels estimated in this study are context-specific and can complement the simple rules of thumb currently used for setting health-motivated tax levels.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30399152/,economics
"The tax subsidy for employment-related health insurance can lead to excessive coverage and excessive spending on medical care. Yet, the potential also exists for adverse selection to result in the opposite problem-insufficient coverage and underconsumption of medical care. This paper uses the model of Rothschild and Stiglitz (R-S) to show that a simple linear premium subsidy can correct market failure due to adverse selection. The optimal linear subsidy balances welfare losses from excessive coverage against welfare gains from reduced adverse selection. Indeed, a capped premium subsidy may mitigate adverse selection without creating incentives for excessive coverage.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(99)00031-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10847931/,economics
"It has already been pointed out that the bootstrap can be used to calculate the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) when individual-level data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is at hand. However, as mentioned by others, it is not clear if and how such a method can be extended to calculate the expected value of sample information (EVSI). In this article, we provide a nonparametric definition for EVPI and EVSI, which is based on considering the entire population distribution as the uncertain entity for which the current RCT provides partial information. This enables a theoretical justification for using the bootstrap for EVPI calculation and allows us to propose a two-level resampling method for EVSI calculation. What is considered as the sampling unit in this algorithm can range from the individual level net benefits to the full panel of the RCT data for an individual, enabling the analyst to decide on a trade-off between computational efficiency and comprehensiveness in value of information analysis. As such, we argue that this method, in addition to being consistent with the popular bootstrap method of RCT-based economic evaluations, is a flexible approach for EVPI and EVSI calculations.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2869,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22933363/,economics

"Disease management has become an important element in the improvement of care for people with chronic illnesses and has become embedded in the discussion on health policy in recent years. The approach has been introduced very differently to the health systems worldwide. Since 1 January 2003 accredited disease management programs (DMPs) have been a part of the risk structure compensation scheme of the German statutory health insurance. This is seen as the first step to a morbidity orientation of the risk structure compensation. DMPs have to be evaluated according the German Social Law, especially whether the objectives of the programs and the criteria for inclusion of the patients have been met and the quality of care for the patients is insured. The criteria for evaluation are threefold: medical issues, economic issues and subjective quality of life of the patients. Due to the immense amounts of data which can be expected the evaluation of the German DMPs is a huge logistical challenge. Until now not very much is known about the data quality. The evaluation is focused on the perspective of the sickness funds as e.g. information about indirect cost is not collected.

"Access to appropriate drug treatments and preventive agents for neurologic disorders is determined by medical, economic, political, social, and personal choices and policies. The development of new agents is dominated by large, often transnational companies located in economically advanced countries. Adequate breadth and stability of pharmaceutical supplies may be jeopardized by local economic, physical, and organizational constraints. Appropriate medical choices of drugs, their number, routes of administration, and sources, are made by physicians informed by their basic and continuing medical education but also influenced to varying degrees by patient expectation, financial incentives, and marketing information provided by the drug industry. Attempts to increase the availability of necessary drug treatment for all include initiatives by the World Health Organization, attention of national health planners to drug development, supply, and use, and industry-government cooperation. Although there are significant differences among countries, many national health planners have taken similar approaches: increasing attention to cost-effectiveness in prescribing and to competitive purchasing; the use of essential drug lists, formularies, and generic drugs; the devising of economic incentives for the development of needed but unprofitable drugs; careful planning of drug procurement and storage; and an emphasis on professional and patient education.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb01492.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9579948/,economics

"The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 enacted a refundable tax credit for low-income working families who purchased health insurance coverage for their children. This health insurance tax credit (HITC) existed during tax years 1991, 1992, and 1993, and was then rescinded. A difference-in-differences estimator applied to Current Population Survey data suggests that adoption of the HITC, along with accompanying increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), was associated with a relative increase of about 4.7 percentage points in the private health insurance coverage of working single mothers with high school or less education. Also, a difference-in-difference-in-differences estimator, which attempts to net out the possible influence of the EITC increases but which requires strong assumptions, suggests that the HITC was responsible for about three-quarters (3.6 percentage points) of the total increase.

"In the current context of rising health care costs and decreasing sustainability, it is becoming increasingly common to resort to decision analytical modeling and health economics evaluations. Decision analytic models are analytical tools that help decision makers to select the best choice between alternative health care interventions, taking into consideration the complexity of the disease, the socioeconomic context, and the relevant differences in outcomes. We present a brief overview of the use of decision analytical models in health economic evaluations and their applications in the area of liver diseases. The aim is to provide the reader with the basic elements to evaluate health economic analysis reports and to discuss some limitations of the current approaches, as highlighted by the case of the therapy of chronic hepatitis C. To serve its purpose, health economics evaluations must be able to do justice to medical innovation and the market while protecting patients and society and promoting fair access to treatment and its economic sustainability.

"Ethiopia's recent improvements in health outcomes benefited from the large increase in development assistance for health received in recent years, most of which supported its primary care system. Increased domestic resource mobilization for health will be needed to sustain progress given recent and likely future declines in external support. We estimate a projection model of Ethiopian government domestic resource mobilization potential compared with future health care delivery costs in order to assess Ethiopia's ability to finance its planned primary health care system. For the period of Ethiopia's current five-year health sector plan (2016-2020), the projection model indicates that if real external resources remain at the levels of 2011, domestic resource mobilization may only provide half of the estimated funds needed. Including out-of-pocket spending currently captured as retained user fees, Ethiopia is more likely to successfully finance continued delivery of primary care. Over 20 years, 2016-2035, the future sustainability of primary care services without increasing contributions from households will depend largely on significant economic growth and more government funding for primary care. Our modeling suggests that Ethiopia can substantially support further development of primary care services, even in the face of declining external support. However, it is unlikely to achieve its goals solely through ""business as usual."" Ethiopia is already moving forward with timely adoption of sound strategies to maintain progress. External partners should support these trends to enable transition plans to greater domestic funding with minimal disruption to positive progress that has been and is being made.",https://doi.org/10.1080/23288604.2018.1448240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30207902/,economics
"Reporting the economic burden of oral diseases is important to evaluate the societal relevance of preventing and addressing oral diseases. In addition to treatment costs, there are indirect costs to consider, mainly in terms of productivity losses due to absenteeism from work. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the direct and indirect costs of dental diseases worldwide to approximate the global economic impact. Estimation of direct treatment costs was based on a systematic approach. For estimation of indirect costs, an approach suggested by the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health was employed, which factored in 2010 values of gross domestic product per capita as provided by the International Monetary Fund and oral burden of disease estimates from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study. Direct treatment costs due to dental diseases worldwide were estimated at US$298 billion yearly, corresponding to an average of 4.6% of global health expenditure. Indirect costs due to dental diseases worldwide amounted to US$144 billion yearly, corresponding to economic losses within the range of the 10 most frequent global causes of death. Within the limitations of currently available data sources and methodologies, these findings suggest that the global economic impact of dental diseases amounted to US$442 billion in 2010. Improvements in population oral health may imply substantial economic benefits not only in terms of reduced treatment costs but also because of fewer productivity losses in the labor market.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034515602879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26318590/,economics

"Given its societal importance, unpaid work should be included in economic evaluations of health care technology aiming to take a societal perspective. However, in practice this does not often appear to be the case. This paper provides an overview of the current place of unpaid work in economic evaluations in theory and in practice. It does so first by summarizing recommendations regarding the inclusion of unpaid labor reported in health economic textbooks and national guidelines for economic evaluations. In total, three prominent health economic text-books were studied and 28 national health economic guidelines. The paper, moreover, provides an overview of the instruments available to measure lost unpaid labor and reports on a review of the place of unpaid labor in applied economic evaluations in the area of rheumatoid arthritis. The review was conducted by examining methodology of evaluations published between 1 March 2008 and 1 March 2013. The results of this study show that little guidance is offered regarding the inclusion of unpaid labor in economic evaluations in textbooks and guidelines. The review identified five productivity costs instruments including questions about unpaid work and 33 economic evaluations of treatments for rheumatoid arthritis of which only one included unpaid work. The results indicate that unpaid work is rarely included in applied economic evaluations of treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, despite this disease expecting to be associated with lost unpaid work. Given the strong effects of certain diseases and treatments on the ability to perform unpaid work, unpaid work currently receives less attention in economic evaluations than it deserves.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.09.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26421997/,economics
"Health economics deals with issues about the use of scarce resources in healthcare. An important branch of health economics concerns economic evaluations, which consist of a comparison of the costs and effects of 2 or more treatments. The role and importance of economic evaluations in oral care are increasing but are not yet as evident as in other areas of healthcare (such as pharmacy). An economic evaluation provides a broad picture of the costs and health benefits of a particular diagnostic or treatment strategy, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio (expressed, for example, as costs per quality-adjusted life year gained). The results are intended for use in policy-making, such as decisions about in- or exclusion from the basic benefits package. To date, only a limited number of economic evaluations of oral care have been carried out, mainly focused on caries. It is important to be able to demonstrate that the treatment provided in oral care is cost-effective. Oral care may put itself in a vulnerable position in the distribution of scarce resources when the costeffectiveness of its treatments is uncertain.",https://doi.org/10.5177/ntvt.2019.06.19015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31211298/,economics
"This research examined the impact of foreign direct investment, natural resources, renewable energy consumption, and economic growth on environmental degradation in BRICS, developing, developed, and global countries for the time period from 1991 to 2018 by using dynamic fixed effect model, GMM, and system GMM estimators. The examined results indicate that FDI causes environmental degradation in BRICS and developing countries while in developed countries, FDI helps environmental degradation reduction. The empirical results indicate that fuel resources and renewable energy consumption help to reduce the environment degradation in BRICS, developing, developed, and global countries while ore and metal resources cause environment degradation improvement in developed countries. Total natural resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and mineral rents) and economic growth are the main factors that boost the environmental degradation in BRICS, developing, developed, and global countries.

We analyze the relationship between insurer and hospital market concentration and the prices of hospital services. We use a national US dataset containing transaction prices for health care services for over 11 million privately insured Americans. Using three years of panel data, we estimate how insurer and hospital market concentration are related to hospital prices, while controlling for unobserved market effects. We find that increases in insurance market concentration are significantly associated with decreases in hospital prices, whereas increases in hospital concentration are non-significantly associated with increases in prices.

The measurement iterative loop systematically assesses the interlocking facets of an illness from the community health perspective, including quantifying burden of illness, etiology, assessment of therapeutic effectiveness, and economic evaluation of therapies. The iterative loop reveals that: (1) burden of illness, although known to be substantial, is so far inaccurately measured, (2) little is known about such factors as provider and patient compliance; and (3) the economics of therapy can guide us in this time of clinical uncertainty when no therapy appears clearly superior. For therapies with at least some support from randomized controlled trials, bedrest appears to be economically superior.

"We analyze causal effects of conditions early in life on the individual mortality rate later in life. Conditions early in life are captured by transitory features of the macro-environment around birth, notably the state of the business cycle around birth, but also food price deviations, weather indicators, and demographic indicators. We argue that these features can only affect high-age mortality by way of the individual early-life conditions. Moreover, they are exogenous from the individual point of view, which is a methodological advantage compared to the use of unique characteristics of the newborn individual or his or her family or household as early-life indicators. We collected national annual time-series data on the above-mentioned indicators, and we combine these to the individual data records from the Danish Twin Registry covering births in 1873-1906. The empirical analyses (mostly based on the estimation of duration models) indicate a significant negative causal effect of economic conditions early in life on individual mortality rates at higher ages. If the national economic performance in the year of birth exceeds its trend value (i.e., if the business cycle is favorable) then the mortality rate later in life is lower. The implied effect on the median lifetime of those who survive until age 35 is about 10 months. A systematic empirical exploration of all macro-indicators reveals that economic conditions in the first years after birth also affect mortality rates later in life.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.02.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19278762/,economics
"The polio endgame remains complicated, with many questions about future polio vaccines and national immunization policies. We simulated possible future poliovirus vaccine routine immunization policies for countries stratified by World Bank Income Levels and estimated the expected costs and cases using an updated integrated dynamic poliovirus transmission, stochastic risk, and economic model. We consider two reference cases scenarios: one that achieves the eradication of all wild polioviruses (WPVs) by 2023 and one in which serotype 1 WPV (WPV1) transmission continues. The results show that the addition of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to routine immunization in all countries substantially increased the expected costs of the polio endgame, without substantially increasing its expected health or economic benefits. Adding a second dose of IPV to the routine immunization schedules of countries that currently include a single IPV dose further increases costs and does not appear economically justified in the reference case that does not stop WPV transmission. For the reference case that includes all WPV eradication, adding a second IPV dose at the time of successful oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation represents a cost-effective option. The risks and costs of needing to restart OPV use change the economics of the polio endgame, although the time horizon used for modeling impacts the overall economic results. National health leaders will want to consider the expected health and economic net benefits of their national polio vaccine strategies recognizing that preferred strategies may differ.",https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13664,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33590519/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of the project was to develop a plan to address a forecasted deficit of approximately $4.65 million for fiscal year 2010/11 in the Vancouver Communities division of the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority. For disinvestment opportunities identified beyond the forecasted deficit, a commitment was made to consider options for resource re-allocation within the Vancouver Communities division.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A standard approach to program budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA) was taken with a priority setting working committee and a broader advisory panel. An experienced, non-vested internal project manager worked closely with the two-member external research team throughout the process. Face to face evaluation interviews were held with 10 decision makers immediately following the process.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The recommendations of the working committee included the implementation of 44 disinvestment initiatives with an annualized value of CAD $4.9 million, as well as consideration of possible investments if the realized savings match expectations. Overall, decision makers viewed the process favorably and the primary aim of addressing the deficit gap was met.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      A key challenge was the tight timeline which likely lead to less evidence informed decision making then one would hope for. Despite this, decision makers felt that better decisions were made then had the process not been in place. In the end, this project adds value in finding that PBMA can be used to cover a deficit and minimize opportunity cost through systematic application of criteria whilst ensuring process fairness through focusing on communication, transparency and decision maker engagement.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-11-169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21756357/,economics

"Biologics are important treatments for a number of cancers, but they are also significant drivers of globally escalating healthcare costs. Biosimilars have the potential to offer cost-savings with comparable efficacy and safety to innovator products. They are being used in the European Union, Canada, Japan, and Australia and may help with improving health outcomes while minimizing costs to patients and global healthcare systems. The overall value of a biosimilar is not determined solely by its pricing. Efficacy and safety relative to the reference biologic drug and competitive agents as well as development and manufacturing costs, treatment administration costs, and results from long-term safety monitoring are considered. Optimizing economic efficiency is one part of an ongoing healthcare decision-making process with all therapeutics that aims to attain high levels of quality-of-care and safety given available resources. Some analytic tools stakeholders use to determine the pharmacoeconomic value of a therapy that are highlighted in this review article are opportunity cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-minimization analyses.

"Hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector. Comparison of hospitals is legally required (BPf1V section 5) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals keener, while also objectivizing it. If comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency, and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality, it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics (no. of cases, days of care, length of stay, case lump sums and special fees). Documentation of particular features of the patient population, the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level. With rising costs, the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service. Hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital's own situation with regard to performance, quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction, but can also provide a basis of structural planning. The fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures, processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients, the doctors who refer them and the visitors. If hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data, it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level. This would be bad for the patient and, in view of the consequent costs, also for the overall costs in the health care sector. Against the backdrop of a future performance-related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one's own costs that has been in place hitherto, openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s001040050574,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10023550/,economics

"The use of economic evaluation in decision making appears to have increased over the past few years and economic evaluation is looked upon as another measure to help contain costs and improve efficiency in an evidence-based decision-making environment. Following the examples of Australia and the Canadian Province of Ontario, four European Union (EU) countries (Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United Kingdom) have recently introduced economic evaluation guidelines. In addition to the Australian and Canadian guidelines, which constitute a hurdle to reimbursement, the paradigm that seems to be evolving in the four EU countries follows a similar route. Finland and the Netherlands seem to be moving toward the notion of a fourth hurdle to reimbursement, whereas the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in England and Wales was in principle meant to influence practice, although in reality this essentially acts as a hurdle to reimbursement, requiring a different data set to that used by regulatory authorities. Whereas the Portuguese guidelines were developed to assist in preparing economic submissions to support reimbursement decisions, they are unclear about when such evidence will be required and also discuss the dissemination of economic evidence to broader audiences. The introduction of these guidelines poses a number of challenges to policy makers, the implications of which are analyzed in the paper: a) to ensure that economic evaluations are carried out scientifically without industrial or political bias; b) to define an acceptable methodology that would increase their credibility; and c) to address certain practical issues ranging from deciding how to use economic evaluations in policy making to setting up new institutions or improving the coordination and dissemination of evidence. The variation in the use of economic evaluation guidelines in the four EU countries highlights the differences in national pharmaceutical policies and is in line with policy makers' continuous attempts to contain costs. While the paper critically discusses the guidelines, it also points out that a series of methodologic issues need to be addressed if economic criteria are to be introduced in policy making with the aim to improve resource allocation. The paper concludes that economic evaluation as a discipline is beginning to impact on policy, whereas the consistent use of economic evaluation results is, in principle, being adopted by policy makers but needs to go a step further to reach practitioners.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462300103216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11155837/,economics

"Despite its salience as a regulatory tool to ensure the delivery of unprofitable medical services, cross-subsidization of services within hospital systems has been notoriously difficult to detect and quantify. We use repeated shocks to a profitable service in the market for hospital-based medical care to test for cross-subsidization of unprofitable services. Using patient-level data from general short-term hospitals in Arizona and Colorado before and after entry by cardiac specialty hospitals, we study how incumbent hospitals adjusted their provision of three uncontested services that are widely considered to be unprofitable. We estimate that the hospitals most exposed to entry reduced their provision of psychiatric, substance-abuse, and trauma care services at a rate of about one uncontested-service admission for every four cardiac admissions they stood to lose. Although entry by single-specialty hospitals may adversely affect the provision of unprofitable uncontested services, these findings warrant further evaluation of service-line cross-subsidization as a means to finance them.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2014.06.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25062300/,economics

International experience highlights the need for gradual and stepwise implementation; the use of budget neutrality adjustments; top-slicing of budgets to stabilise provider income; and use of the classification system to drive improvements in quality and cost-effectiveness. All systems adjusted for length of stay, but methods varied. Comparing English mental healthcare providers, median length of stay ranged from 2 to 42 days for emergency admissions and from 0 to 56 days for elective admissions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      New payment systems must account for the economic incentives they embody, and appropriate adjustments for variations in length of stay are essential.",https://doi.org/10.3109/09638237.2011.562261,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574789/,economics
"A long-running debate surrounds the equivalence of the welfarist and extra-welfarist approaches to economic evaluation. There is a growing belief that the extra-welfarist approach may not necessarily provide all the information that decisionmakers require in certain contexts, e.g. evaluation of complex interventions. As the number of these interventions being evaluated increases, it is crucial that the most appropriate economic evaluation approach is used to enable decisionmakers to be confident in their adoption decisions. We conducted a literature review to evaluate the potential for the choice of economic evaluation approach to impact on the adoption decisions recommended by economic evaluation studies. We found that for every five studies applying both approaches, one shows limited or no concordance in economic evaluation results: the different approaches suggest conflicting adoption decisions, and there is no pattern to which approach provides the most convincing adoption evidence. Only one study in ten indicates which results will best inform adoption decisions. We conclude that the choice of approach can significantly impact on the adoption decisions recommended by economic evaluation studies, with conflicting results creating confusion over whether or not interventions provide good value for money. Health economists rarely provide sufficient guidance to decisionmakers to alleviate this confusion.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-015-0261-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680402/,economics
"Funding of expensive treatments for rare (orphan) diseases is contentious. These agents fare poorly on 'efficiency' or health economic measures, such as the quality-adjusted life years, because of high cost and frequently poor gains in quality of life and survival. We show that cost-effectiveness assessments are flawed, and have only a limited role to play in reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs and beyond.",https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcu016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24453281/,economics
"Despite the well-documented social, economic, and adaptive advantages for young children, adolescents, and adults, the traditional family in the West is in decline. A growing percentage of men and women choose not to be bound by the traditional moral and social expectations of marriage and family life. Adults are much more likely than in the past to live as sexually active singles, with a concomitant increase in forms of social isolation as well as in the number of children born outside of marriage. These social shifts are also connected to public policies that provide incentives for individuals to exit the family, leaving behind its social, capital, and economic resources. The individualistic character of the social-democratic egalitarian ideology that underlies the current dominant approaches to health care financing in Western Europe and much of North America, for example, is associated with a decline in family stability. Welfare entitlements, including state-based health care, have made it easier to exit the family, undermining the centrality of the family's core human relationships. This essay argues for the importance of recognizing the cardinal role and reality of the family and for the importance of family-based health care savings accounts for preserving family integrity, while also providing for sustainable long-term health care reform.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jmp/jhs047,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23178331/,economics

"The menu-setting problem (MSP) determines the goods and services an institution offers and the prices charged. It appears widely in health care, from choosing the services an insurance arrangement offers, to selecting the health plans an employer proffers. The challenge arises because purchases are subsidized, and consumers (or their physician agents) may make cost-ineffective choices. The intuitively comprehensible MSP model--readily solved by computer using actual data--helps structure thinking and support decision making about such problems.

"Background:
        
      
      Assessment of drug costs for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in the United States is not straightforward because the prices paid for drugs are not publicly available and differ between payers. CEAs have relied on list prices that do not reflect the rebates and discounts known to be associated with these purchases.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To review available cost measures and propose a novel strategy that is transparent, consistent, and applicable to all CEAs taking a US health care sector perspective or a societal payer's perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We propose using the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC), the Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (VAFSS), and their midpoint as the upper bound, lower bound, and base case, respectively, to estimate net drug prices for various payers. We compare this approach with wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), the most common measure observed in our literature review. The minimum WAC is used to provide the most conservative comparison.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our sample consists of 1436 brand drugs and 1599 generic drugs. On average, the upper bound (NADAC) is 1% and 9.8% lower than the WAC for brand and generic drugs respectively, whereas the lower bound (VAFSS) is 48.3% and 54.2% lower than the WAC. The NADAC is less than the WAC in 89.6% of drug groups. The distributions of these relationships do not show a clear mode and have wide variation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study suggests that the WAC may be an overestimate for the base case because the minimum WAC is higher than the NADAC for most drugs. Our approach balances uncertainty and lack of data for the cost of pharmaceuticals with the need for a transparent and consistent approach for valid CEAs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.06.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29909872/,economics
"The purpose of this study is to explore the factors associated with outsourcing of information systems (IS) in hospital-based health care delivery systems, and to determine if there is a difference in IS outsourcing activity based on the strategic value of the outsourced functions. IS sourcing behavior is conceptualized as a case of vertical integration. A synthesis of strategic management theory (SMT) and transaction cost economics (TCE) serves as the theoretical framework. The sample consists of 1,365 hospital-based health care delivery systems that own 3,452 hospitals operating in 2004. The findings indicate that neither TCE nor SMT predicted outsourcing better than the other did. The findings also suggest that health care delivery system managers may not be considering significant factors when making sourcing decisions, including the relative strategic value of the functions they are outsourcing. It is consistent with previous literature to suggest that the high cost of IS may be the main factor driving the outsourcing decision.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-009-9100-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20058531/,economics
"In November 2016, the Government of India (GOI) demonetized the commonly used Rs500 and Rs1,000 denominations. This was a short-term economic policy, known as notebandi, implemented as a means to address black money, counterfeit currencies, and terrorist activities. Notebandi was unrolled in a chaotic, confusing, and complex manner, leaving many people with limited access to cash in their daily activities. And the poor, who tend to earn their livelihoods from cash, were faced with economic exclusion and even destitution. In this paper, we argue that demonetization had disproportionately negative consequences on the poor and trace the main pathways between demonetization and the health of the poor. We conclude by calling on public health researchers to monitor and evaluate the health consequences of India's latest demonetization and to rapidly assess future policy initiatives in order to help advise governments in devising and implementing economic policies that does not harm the health of people, especially the poor.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731418772465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29695202/,economics

Every American would be automatically covered for life. Premiums would be replaced with a set of Medicare taxes. There would be no patient cost sharing. Individuals would have free choice of doctors. Medicare's single-payer bargaining power would slow price increases and reduce medical cost as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).

"Introduction:
        
      
      To identify studies reporting costs arising from tobacco use and detail their (1) economic approaches, (2) health outcomes, and (3) other cost areas included.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EconLit, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2008 and April 2018 in English. Eligible articles reported tobacco-related costs and included all tobacco-using populations (multinational, national, subpopulations, and involuntary smokers). All economic approaches that resulted in monetary outcomes were included. We reported USD or converted local currencies to USD. Two health economists extracted and two researchers independently reviewed the data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 4083 articles, we reviewed 361 abstracts and examined 79 full-texts, with 63 (1.6%) deemed eligible. There were three multinational, thirty-four national, twenty-one subpopulation or condition(s)-specific analyses, and five evaluating involuntary smoking. The diverse approaches and outcomes precluded integrating costs, but these were substantial in all studies. For instance, about USD 1436 billion in global health expenditures and productivity losses in 2012 and USD 9 billion in lost productivity in China, Brazil, and South Africa in 2012. At the national level, costs ranged from USD 4665 in annual per respondent health expenses (Germany 2006-2008) to USD 289-332.5 billion in medical expenses (United States 1964-2014).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite wide variations in the methods used, the identified costs of tobacco are substantial. Studies on tobacco cost-of-illness use diverse methods and hence produce data that are not readily comparable across populations, time, and studies, precluding a consistent evidence-base for action and measurement of progress. Recommendations are made to improve comparability.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      In addition to the health and financial costs to individual smokers, smoking imposes costs on the broader community. Production of comparable estimates of the societal cost of tobacco use is impaired by a plethora of economic models and inconsistently included costs and conditions. These inconsistencies also cause difficulties in comparing relative impacts caused by differing factors. The review systematically documents the post-2007 literature on tobacco cost-of-illness estimations and details conditions and costs included. We hope this will encourage replication of models across settings to provide more consistent data, able to be integrated across populations, over time, and across risk factors.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz038,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30874290/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Length of stay is the main determinant of the cost of hospitalization, which is why strategies must be implemented to reduce conventional hospital stays while maintaining quality levels. Short Stay Units (SSU) were created with the aim of reducing hospital stays in a certain group of patients and pathologies. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the literature on the evidence of decreased length of stay, efficiency, readmissions in the emergency department, cost-effectiveness, and mortality of these units.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We made a systematic review of the literature, using the MeSH terms ""Observation Unit"", ""Short-Stay Ward"", ""Monday to Friday Clinic"" , ""Monday to Friday Surgery Ward"", ""Short Stay Hospitalization"", ""Alternative to Conventional Hospitalization"", ""Alternative Admissions"" in the MEDLINE database, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane Library from January 1 1960 to January 1 2012. The studies reviewed were selected according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Protocol.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The SSU made it possible in certain groups of patients to reduce the period of stay and maintain efficiency, showing no increases in emergency readmissions or mortality.

"Introduction:
        
      
      Therapeutic innovation contributes to the increase of health care expenditures in France. Medico-economic evaluation has still a minor role in the decision-making for the registration of drugs and medical devices in hospitals. This study aimed to systematically review published works on medico-economic studies conducted within French hospitals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature review was carried out to search for medico-economic studies conducted by hospital teams on therapeutic or diagnostic strategies employed within French hospitals and published from 2010 to 2014. Quality assessment of selected studies was performed according to Drummond et al.'s checklist, which is also used within French guidelines.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 44 analyzed articles, methods for identification and measure of costs and results complied with guidelines in 95 % of cases. For results interpretation, compliance was 91 %. Costs discounting (29 %) and the use of sensitivity analysis to account for results uncertainty (70 %) were the parameters with the lowest compliance to guidelines.

In the long term, the price of generics is found to decrease by 81% when the number of firms selling generics with the same strength, form and similar package size is increased from 1 to 10. Nearly only competition at this fine-grained level matters; the effect of firms selling other products with the same active substance, but with different package size, form, or strength, is only a tenths as large. Half of the price reductions take place immediately and 70% within three months.

"Context:
        
      
      Millions of uninsured Americans ostensibly have insurance available to them-many at very low cost-but do not take it up. Traditional economic analysis is based on the premise that these are rational decisions, but it is hard to reconcile observed enrollment patterns with this view. The policy prescriptions that the traditional model generates may thus fail to achieve their goals. Behavioral economics, which integrates insights from psychology into economic analysis, identifies important deviations from the traditional assumptions of rationality and can thus improve our understanding of what drives health insurance take-up and improved policy design.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Rather than a systematic review of the coverage literature, this article is a primer for considering issues in health insurance coverage from a behavioral economics perspective, supplementing the standard model. We present relevant evidence on decision making and insurance take-up and use it to develop a behavioral approach to both the policy problem posed by the lack of health insurance coverage and possible policy solutions to that problem.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      We found that evidence from behavioral economics can shed light on both the sources of low take-up and the efficacy of different policy levers intended to expand coverage. We then applied these insights to policy design questions for public and private insurance coverage and to the implementation of the recently enacted health reform, focusing on the use of behavioral insights to maximize the value of spending on coverage.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We concluded that the success of health insurance coverage reform depends crucially on understanding the behavioral barriers to take-up. The take-up process is likely governed by psychology as much as economics, and public resources can likely be used much more effectively with behaviorally informed policy design.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00656.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22428694/,economics
"This paper investigates a possible predictor of adverse selection problems in unsubsidized stand-alone prescription drug insurance: the persistence of an individual's high spending over multiple years. Using Medstat claims data and data from the Medicare Survey of Current Beneficiaries, we find that persistence is much higher for outpatient drug expenses than for other categories of medical expenses. We then use these estimates to develop a simple and intuitive model of adverse selection in competitive insurance markets and show that this high relative persistence makes it unlikely that unsubsidized drug insurance can be offered for sale, even with premiums partially risk adjusted, without a probable adverse selection death spiral. We show that this outcome can be avoided if drug coverage is bundled with other coverage, and we briefly discuss the need either for comprehensive coverage or generous subsidies if adverse selection is to be avoided in private and Medicare insurance markets.",https://doi.org/10.2202/1558-9544.1051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15612335/,economics
"This study examines the economic evidence on preventive health care. A discussion of benefit-cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis, their applications to preventive strategies, and the problems inherent in implementing these approaches precedes a review of the empirical evidence. Prevention strategies are grouped into three categories: lifestyle changes, public health measures and screening programs. Lifestyle changes include altering behavior patterns as they relate to alcohol and drug abuse, smoking and automobile safety regulations. Included in public health measures are immunizations against communicable diseases, water fluoridation and food inspection. Screening includes programs for the detection of PKU and congenital hypothyroidism in newborn infants, for spina bifida cystica in the unborn fetus, and hypertension. The paper concludes that many of the preventive health measures examined represent an efficient use of resources. Because only quantifiable changes in health status or costs are included in the benefit-cost and cost-effectiveness analyses, the actual value of prevention strategies may be understated since reductions in pain and suffering usually are omitted.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-198005000-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6772886/,economics
"A methodology to obtain the most economical operational condition of membrane bioreactor (MBR) is developed. In order to achieve the optimum design parameters of MBR with which operational costs are minimized, aeration and sludge treatment costs were estimated for various operational conditions. Generally sludge treatment cost and aeration cost were inversely proportional to each other, which means sludge treatment cost is minimized when aeration cost is maximized and vice versa. Therefore, there might exist an optimum point between the two extreme cases. However, sludge treatment cost turned out to overwhelm the aeration cost over the reasonable operational conditions. Therefore, sludge minimization was considered to be a key for the economical operation of MBR. In the case of typical municipal wastewater of which COD was 400mgL(-1), steady-state MLSS was expected to increase from 11,000 to 15,000mg/L without sludge removal when HRT was decreasing from 16 to 12h. For the range of operational conditions considered in this study, economically optimum HRT and target MLSS were turned out to be 16h and 11,000mg/L, respectively.

"Background:
        
      
      The preservation of the economic livelihood of tobacco farmers is a common argument used to oppose tobacco control measures. However, little empirical evidence exists about these livelihoods. We seek to evaluate the economic livelihoods of individual tobacco farmers in Malawi, including how much money they earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers' decisions to contract directly with firms that buy their crops.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We designed and implemented an economic survey of 685 tobacco farmers, including both independent and contract farmers, across the 6 main tobacco-growing districts. We augmented the survey with focus group discussions with subsets of respondents from each region to refine our inquiries.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Contract farmers cultivating tobacco in Malawi as their main economic livelihoods are typically operating at margins that place their households well below national poverty thresholds, while independent farmers are typically operating at a loss. Even when labour is excluded from the calculation of income less costs, farmers' gross margins place most households in the bottom income decile of the overall population. Tobacco farmers appear to contract principally as a means to obtain credit, which is consistently reported to be difficult to obtain.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The tobacco industry narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic endeavour for smallholder farmers is demonstrably inaccurate in the context of Malawi.

      A systematic search of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence TAs of colorectal, lung and ovarian cancer was undertaken for the period up to April 2020. For each TA, the pivotal clinical studies and economic evaluations were reviewed for considerations of patient and treatment effect heterogeneity. The study critically reviews the use of subgroup analysis and real-world translation in economic evaluations, alongside specific attributes of the economic modeling framework.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search identified 49 TAs including 49 economic models. In total, 804 subgroup analyses were reported across 69 clinical studies. The most common stratification factors were age, gender, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, with 15% (119 of 804) of analyses demonstrating significantly different clinical outcomes to the main population; economic subgroup analyses were undertaken in only 17 TAs. All economic models were cohort-level with the majority described as partitioned survival models (39) or Markov/semi-Markov models. The impact of real-world heterogeneity on disease progression estimates was only explored in 2 models.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The ability of current modeling approaches to capture patient and treatment effect heterogeneity is constrained by their limited flexibility and simplistic nature. This study highlights a need for the use of more sophisticated modeling methods that enable greater consideration of real-world heterogeneity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.12.022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34243843/,economics
"Physician groups are growing larger in size and fewer in number. Although this consolidation could result in improved patient care, the resulting increase in market concentration also could allow larger groups to negotiate higher physician fees from private insurers. We examined the association between market concentration and physician fees in the case of total knee arthroplasty by calculating market concentration for orthopedic groups practicing in a given market and by analyzing administrative claims data from Marketscan. In the period 2001-10 the average professional fee for total knee arthroplasty was $2,537. During this time, in markets that moved from the bottom quartile of concentration to the top quartile, physician fees paid by private payers increased by $168 per procedure. The increase nearly offset the $261 decline in fees that we observed, absent changes in market concentration. These findings suggest that caution should be used in implementing policies designed to encourage further group concentration, which could produce similar effects.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1325,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056195/,economics
"This paper analyzes the transformation of the central organization in the managed care system: the multiproduct, multimarket health plan. It examines vertical disintegration, the shift from ownership to contractual linkages between plans and provider organizations, and horizontal integration--the consolidation of erstwhile indemnity carriers, Blue Cross plans, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and specialty networks. Health care consumers differ widely in their preferences and willingness to pay for particular products and network characteristics, while providers differ widely in their willingness to adopt particular organization and financing structures. This heterogeneity creates an enduring role for health plans that are diversified into multiple networks, benefit products, distribution channels, and geographic regions. Diversification now is driving health plans toward being national, full-service corporations and away from being local, single-product organizations linked to particular providers and selling to particular consumer niches.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.18.2.7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10091427/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The University of Kentucky College of Dentistry (UKCD) runs a large mobile dental operation. Economic conditions dictate that as the mobile units age it will be harder to find donors willing or able to provide the financial resources for asset replacement. In order to maintain current levels of access for the underserved, consideration of replacement is paramount. A financial analysis for a new mobile unit was conducted to determine self-sustainability, return on investment (ROI), and feasibility of generating a cash reserve for its replacement in 12 years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Information on clinical income, operational and replacement costs, and capital costs was collected. A capital budgeting analysis (CBA) was conducted using the Net Present Value (NPV) methodology in four different scenarios. Depreciation funding was calculated by transferring funds from cash inflows and reinvested to offset depreciation at fixed compound interest.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A positive ROI was obtained for two scenarios. He depreciation fund did not generate a cash reserve sufficient to replace the mobile unit.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Mobile dental programs can play a vital role in providing access to care to underserved populations and ensuring their mission requires long-term planning. Careful financial viability and CBA based on sound assumptions are excellent decision-making tools.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-7325.2009.00140.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19694936/,economics
"This article investigates the determinants of the prices of pharmaceuticals and their impact on the demand for prescription drugs in the context of Taiwan's pharmaceutical market where medical providers earn profit directly from prescribing and dispensing drugs. Based on product-level data, we find evidence that the profit-seeking behavior of the medical providers in the prescription drug market transfers the force of competition from the unregulated wholesale market to the regulated retail market and hence market competition still plays an important role in the determination of the regulated price. We also find that the profit-seeking behavior plays a similar role to advertising in that it increases the brand loyalty and hence lowers price elasticity. An important implication of our study is that the institutional features in the pharmaceutical market matter in shaping the nature of pharmaceutical competition and the responsiveness of pharmaceutical consumption with respect to changes in price.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.03.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22525716/,economics
"The paper attempts to evaluate the clinical and economic benefits between the administration of the dual and triple antiretroic schemes for the treatment of the HIV disease. Clinical and economic data are derived from patients hospitalized in 1996 and 1997 at the University Department of Dermatology and Venereology of Andreas Sygros Hospital. Methodology is based on the comparison of patients' nosological profile and direct annual cost before and after the administration of the triple treatment. The results of the study present that the triple combination therapy yields superior health outcomes, (decrease in the days of hospitalization and in the opportunistic disease events as well as fewer deaths and loss of production). Cost comparison presents a small decrease in the annual patient's cost, where all cost components are diminished, except the medication cost. A substitution of hospital care by drug therapy is revealed and a great change is taken place in the composition of the drugs' cost. Patient cost for antiretroic drugs has more than doubled from 1996 to 1997.",https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1005640500643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11288483/,economics
What is the benefit of the federal state's investment in and funding of both high-level medical education and health care? The main question is whether the benefit justifies the necessary costs of these institutions.

"Objective:
        
      
      We investigated whether or not changes in economic conditions during the 2008-2010 U.S. recession were associated with changes in Connecticut local health jurisdictions' (LHJs') revenue or personnel levels.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We analyzed Connecticut Department of Public Health 2005-2012 annual report data from 91 Connecticut LHJs, as well as publicly available data on economic conditions. We used fixed- and random-effect regression models to test whether or not LHJ per capita revenues and full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel differed during and post-recession compared with pre-recession, or varied with recession intensity, as measured by unemployment rates and housing permits.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On average, total revenue per capita was significantly lower during and post-recession compared with pre-recession, with two-thirds of LHJs experiencing per capita revenue reductions. FTE personnel per capita were significantly lower post-recession. Changes in LHJ-level unemployment rates and housing permits did not explain the variation in revenue or FTE personnel per capita. Revenue and personnel differed significantly by LHJ organizational structure across all time periods.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Economic downturns can substantially reduce resources available for local public health.

"In this article we have discussed a number of aspects of economic appraisal. Economic evaluation considers both costs and benefits. Cost-benefit analysis requires the evaluation of health in dollar terms but allows the comparison of health programmes with other programmes or the evaluation of one project alone. Because of the problems that are associated with placing a monetary value on life and health, cost-benefit analysis has not been used in the health field as extensively as has cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analysis is used to compare alternative programmes with the same health goal. The importance of quality as well as length of life as health outcomes has led to the development of cost-utility analysis. Finally, a good economic evaluation of health care requires the collaboration of clinicians and health economists.",https://doi.org/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1990.tb124461.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2104950/,economics
"Health care financing can be based on one of two conflicting principles: health care as a right versus the insurance principle. The former assures equal access to care for all people regardless of income, while the latter requires each grouping in society to pay its own way. In the United States, health financing has utilized both principles, with employer-sponsored group health insurance approximating health care as a right. However, the insurance principle is increasingly eroding this right. In five major areas, the private health insurance industry has serious flaws: it has contributed to health care inflation; it wastes billions in administrative and marketing costs; it is unfair to many groups in society; it has undermined the positive features of health maintenance organization reform; and it has far too much political and economic power. In order to establish health care as a right as the guiding principle of U.S. health care financing, the private health insurance industry and the insurance principle should be abolished.",https://doi.org/10.2190/dakx-ull1-r1ef-x5nr,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2332260/,economics
"Study objective:
        
      
      To describe the economics of UK school breakfast clubs, to estimate costs resulting from clubs and to investigate relationships between costs and outcomes.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A postal survey of schools with a 1-year follow-up, a cluster randomized controlled trial, case studies, semi-structured interviews with parents and a secondary econometric analysis.

          Main results:
        
      
      Key economic differences were identified between clubs based in primary schools and those based in secondary schools in terms of both funding levels and cost structures. However, funding levels were not a significant determinant of the observed outcomes in either type of school.

"The economic effectiveness of disease management programs, which are designed to improve the clinical and economic outcomes for chronically ill individuals, has been evaluated extensively. A literature search was performed with MEDLINE and other published sources for the period covering January 1995 to September 2003. The search was limited to empirical articles that measured the direct economic outcomes for asthma, diabetes, and heart disease management programs. Of the 360 articles and presentations evaluated, only 67 met the selection criteria for meta-analysis, which included 32,041 subjects. Although some studies contained multiple measurements of direct economic outcomes, only one average effect size per study was included in the meta-analysis. Based on the studies included in the research, a meta-analysis provided a statistically significant answer to the question of whether disease management programs are economically effective. The magnitude of the observed average effect size for equally weighted studies was 0.311 (95% CI = 0.272-0.350). Statistically significant differences of effect sizes by study design, disease type and intensity of disease management program interventions were not found after a moderating variable, disease severity, was taken into consideration. The results suggest that disease management programs are more effective economically with severely ill enrollees and that chronic disease program interventions are most effective when coordinated with the overall level of disease severity. The findings can be generalized, which may assist health care policy makers and practitioners in addressing the issue of providing economically effective care for the growing number of individuals with chronic illness.",https://doi.org/10.1089/dis.2005.8.114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15815160/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Prostate cancer, the most frequent malignant disease in males in Europe, accounts for a great proportion of health expenditures.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      A systematic review of registry-based studies about the cost-of-illness and related factors of prostate cancer, published in the last 10 years.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A MEDLINE-based literature review was carried out between January 1, 2003 and October 1, 2013.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen peer-reviewed articles met the criteria of interest. In developed countries radiotherapy, surgical treatment and hormone therapy account for the greatest per capita costs. In Europe early stage tumours (4-7000 €, 2006), while in the USA metastatic prostate cancer (19 900-25 500 $, 2004) was associated with highest per capita expenses. In Europe the greatest costs incurred within the initial treatment (6400 €/6 months, 2008), while in the USA within the end-of-life care (depending on age: 62 200-93 400 $, 2010).

"Background:
        
      
      Health economic studies attempt to objectivity treatment results to place them in economic. These studies summarize both physician care and other medical services to allow a more rational use of limited resources and are of great value.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The health economic studies in the literature were analyzed by the conducting countries, financing, the study period and the interval until publication. A quantitative comparison to other specialties in medicine was performed. On the basis of a checklist of basic criteria, a qualitative assessment of the studies was performed to rate the significance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The number of studies showed a fivefold increase. A third of the dermatological studies (n = 71) were conducted in the United States, 23.94% in Great Britain, 9.86% in Sweden and 35.23% in other countries. The interval until publication was 0 to 9 years.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The increase in the number of studies may be explained by the growing demand for clarification of the economical situation. Reasons for the significant differences between different countries might be the financing of the studies or the nature of the dominant health care system. Whereas American studies are predominantly sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, the ones in Great Britain and Sweden are supported by public authorities. The long delays in publishing may be accounted for by long review periods and by difficulties in transferring large amounts of data in international studies. Particularly the introduction of the DRG system in Germany has increased demands for cost-effective action on the basis of well-founded and high-quality health economic studies.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0353.2004.04724.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16285324/,economics
"Competitive health insurance markets will only enhance cost-containment, efficiency, quality, and consumer responsiveness if all consumers feel free to easily switch insurer. Consumers will switch insurer if their perceived switching benefits outweigh their perceived switching costs. We developed a conceptual framework with potential switching benefits and costs in competitive health insurance markets. Moreover, we used a questionnaire among Dutch consumers (1091 respondents) to empirically examine the relevance of the different switching benefits and costs in consumers' decision to (not) switch insurer. Price, insurers' service quality, insurers' contracted provider network, the benefits of supplementary insurance, and welcome gifts are potential switching benefits. Transaction costs, learning costs, 'benefit loss' costs, uncertainty costs, the costs of (not) switching provider, and sunk costs are potential switching costs. In 2013 most Dutch consumers switched insurer because of (1) price and (2) benefits of supplementary insurance. Nearly half of the non-switchers - and particularly unhealthy consumers - mentioned one of the switching costs as their main reason for not switching. Because unhealthy consumers feel not free to easily switch insurer, insurers have reduced incentives to invest in high-quality care for them. Therefore, policymakers should develop strategies to increase consumer choice.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2014.11.015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25530069/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The debate on US healthcare reform has largely focused on the introduction of a public health plan option. While supporters stress various beneficial effects that would arise from increased competition in the health insurance market, opponents often contend that a public plan would drive insurers out of the market and potentially lead to the 'collapse' of the private health insurance industry.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To contribute to the US healthcare reform debate by inferring, from financial market data, the effect that the public option is likely to have on the private health insurance market.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study utilized daily data on the price of a security that was traded in a prediction market from June 2009 and whose pay-off was tied to the event that a federal government-run healthcare plan - the 'public option' - would be approved by 31 December 2009 (100 daily observations). These data were combined with data on stock returns of health insurance companies (1500 observations from 100 trading days and 15 companies) to evaluate the expected effect of the public option on private health insurers. The impact on hospital companies (1000 observations) was also estimated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results suggested that daily stock returns of health insurance companies significantly responded to the changing probability regarding the public option. A 10% increase in the probability that the public option would pass, on average, reduced the stock returns of health insurance companies by 1.28% (p < 0.001). Hospital company stock returns were also affected (0.9% reduction; p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results reveal the market expectation of a negative effect of the public option on the value of health insurance companies. The magnitude of the effect suggests a downward adjustment in the expected profits of health insurers of around 13%, but it does not support more calamitous scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11535510-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20201607/,economics
"China's economic policies of the past 25 years have shaped its present health-care system. China's leadership has decided to have neither a national health-insurance system nor a national health service. Instead, it decided that its health system would mirror the workings of its industrial and agricultural system. Decisions to minimize imports, ban private economic activity, assign university graduates on a compulsory basis, control wages, maintain a large domestic standing army and prevent professions or universities from acquiring independent status led directly to the present system of medical care. Consequently, transplantation of China's striking achievements in health-care delivery to the United States or other countries is unlikely to occur in the absence of transfer of the underlying economic policies.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm197906283002603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/449887/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      We evaluated the economic aspects of an orthopaedic trauma section at a regional Level I, semi-academic community hospital. This study analyzes the economics of a dedicated hospital-based orthopaedic trauma program.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Institutional financial reports were analyzed for 2 time periods. In the pre-program (PRE) period (2 years), we estimated the amount of forsaken revenue resulting from cases transferred to other institutions. In the post-program (POST) period (2 years), we analyzed financial reports to evaluate fiscal solvency. Health Care Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-90 codes, and Eclipsys software were used. Standard accounting definitions for gross revenue, net revenue, direct costs, contribution margin, indirect costs, and net profit/loss were used.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the PRE-program period 88 patients were transferred; forsaken charges were about $1.25 million/year. Based on historic collection rates, there was about $450,000/year of actual lost revenue. In the POST-program period net revenue was about $7 million with a $1.5 million contribution margin, which increased 9%-11% in year 2. With inclusion of indirect costs, there was a net loss of nearly $5 million/year, but the financial software uses the direct cost expense as a major determinant of indirect costs. Based on the definition of indirect costs (overhead for lights, maintenance, etc) and with such expenses being used prior to the program, we felt that indirect cost was not an accurate variable and contribution margin is the better measure of economic value.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We found that orthopaedic trauma is a financially viable program. Understanding the determination and interpretation of financial data is essential for any such analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1097/bot.0b013e31816bae67,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18404030/,economics
"Recent clinical publications have increasingly emphasized comparison of cost with benefits in such areas such as drug therapies, surgical procedures, and prophylaxis regimes within certain populations. In the past, cost analysis was based principally on the comparative market price of new treatment compared with standard therapy. Benefits were assessed solely in terms of objective clinical and imaging improvement. Now, issues such as quality of life, early return to occupation, and subjective symptoms of pain and discomfort caused by a treatment are also being critically evaluated. Addressing these latter issues, however, is often complicated and expensive. This article reviews some terms and principles of cost analysis, cost effectiveness, and cost-benefit analysis. Examples are given of recent attempts to quantify costs and benefits for individuals, hospitals, health organizations, and society as a whole. Guidelines are suggested concerning how these studies can be applied to oral and maxillofacial surgery.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0278-2391(96)90646-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632248/,economics
"Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the economic burden of AD itself is well recognized, little is known about the direct and indirect costs associated with MCI before the onset of AD. Insufficient data on the economic impact of MCI as well as other gaps in the knowledge base (such as estimates of MCI progression rates and factors that drive MCI-related costs) present challenges to understanding the burden of MCI and to modeling the cost-effectiveness of potential MCI interventions. Initiating treatment and care management in the MCI phase could improve the health and well-being of patients and caregivers and possibly offset certain costs. Future economic analyses should incorporate new data, as they become available, from patient registries and linked administrative claims and electronic medical records to better characterize the cost consequences of MCI detection and management. Such analyses should help payers, providers, and policy makers make more informed decisions about the costs and benefits of new tests, treatments, and other management strategies for the condition.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.2117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23141385/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Hospital reimbursement for Medicare/Medicaid/self-pay patients has not kept pace with rising expenses, and even well run efficient organizations struggle to maintain a positive margin on these cases. Therefore, hospitals rely on commercially insured patients to remain economically viable. However, hospitals located in areas with a high Medicare/Medicaid/uninsured population cannot depend on a favorable payer mix for financial sustainability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database, total joint arthroplasties (TJAs) in New York from 2000 to 2012 were identified. Hospitals were divided into quartiles by volume, with quartile 1 representing the lowest volume hospitals. TJA cases were stratified by primary payer type, and the percentage of each primary payer type was calculated and compared among quartiles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The highest number of hospitals performing TJAs was 207 in 2000, and the least number of hospitals was in 2012, with only 178 hospitals performing TJA. Despite the decrease in the number of hospitals, the total number of joint arthroplasties increased from 33,036 in 2000 to 62,104 in 2012.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study demonstrates that higher volume hospitals tended to have a more favorable payer mix (less Medicare/Medicaid/self-pay patients). This inequity widened over the 12-year study period. This trend has ethical implications for lower socioeconomic status patients as high-volume centers tend to have superior outcomes compared with low-volume centers. In addition, the lower volume high Medicare/Medicaid/self-pay hospitals are more susceptible to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality penalties making their economic viability even more tenuous potentially leading to access of care problems for these patients.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2016.01.054,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26994649/,economics
"In this paper, the medical equipment replacement strategy is optimised using a multistage stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) approach. The outcome is an optimal path which shows whether to keep an existing piece of medical equipment (defender) or replace it with a more economical alternative (challenger). We assume that each decision can result in a number of different possible outcomes, each with a known probability. Contrary to deterministic dynamic programming, the state at the next stage is not completely determined by the state and policy decision at the current stage. Instead, the next stage depends on the operation and maintenance cost which is modelled as a stochastic variable. A Keep-Replace sequence of the highest returns (lowest costs) is the result of solving the problem using forward decision making. The benefit of the SDP solution versus that of keeping medical equipment until the end of its expected life is investigated for three scenarios: (1) no revenue for the defender and the challenger, (2) equal revenues for both, and (3) higher revenue for the challenger. The percentage of benefits relative to the current acquisition cost for the three scenarios are 616.9%, 728.2%, and 789.29%, respectively. Each percentage represents the relative difference between the equipment life cycle cost of the optimal sequence and that of the conventional sequence.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03091902.2020.1799096,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32886020/,economics
"The soical and economic effects of end-stage renal disease are enormous. This case history of our experience with dialysis and transplantation details our life with these two modes of treatment. Despite the common notion that Medicare covers most of the expenses, the detailed records of our financial experience show that Medicare paid only 53 per cent of our total costs; the remainder came from a mixture of private and public sources. In seeking alternative financial support, we encountered many problems, including complex and constraining requirements for aid, invasion of privacy, high insurance and bank-interest rates and termination of employment. Even those in middle-income brackets find it difficult to maintain their independence under such circumstances. New legislation extending Medicare coverage of home dialysis and transplantation should help to alleviate these problems in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm197808242990804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/353558/,economics
This paper presents the simulation analysis of a proposal for publicly financed competition in the Canadian health care system. The proposal incorporates cost-conscious consumer choice among alternative delivery modalities within a system of national health insurance. Five model structures for competition are examined using data from a market area in the province of Ontario. The simulation results indicate the potential for competition to have a significant impact on health care expenditure over a range of plausible circumstances. The results also suggest that it may not be necessary to go so far as a system of formal competition in order to achieve much of the potential savings associated with alternative delivery modalities.,https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(89)90024-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10313421/,economics

"Veterinarians in sub-Saharan Africa work in resource-deficient environments. Decisions taken by veterinarians in this sub-region, on animal health, animal husbandry and public health issues, are therefore influenced by economic factors including macro-economic considerations related to the current structural adjustment programmes being implemented in the sub-region. In turn, decisions or advice given by veterinarians have socio-economic consequences on clients, on the effectiveness of the delivery systems for veterinary services and on the growth of national economies. For these reasons, economics and planning should be essential components of all modern veterinary undergraduate programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, in order to give veterinarians a basis for making decisions and giving advice which is both technically and economically sound. The authors argue that principles of livestock economics, livestock enterprise management, livestock investment analysis and economics of animal health care are necessary elements in economics and planning courses. They propose a division of these elements into discrete course units to allow for flexibility and adaptability to the different curriculum structures of schools in sub-Saharan Africa and, possibly, continuing professional development courses. The resource requirement for teaching the courses, the integration of the units in the undergraduate programme and the problems which are likely to be encountered in developing the courses are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.12.3.713,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8219326/,economics
"In 2015 the Bureau of Economic Analysis released an experimental set of measures referred to as the Health Care Satellite Account, which tracks national health care spending by medical condition. These statistics improve the understanding of the health care sector by blending medical claims data and survey data to present measures of national spending and cost of treatment by condition. This article introduces key aspects of the new account and uses it to study the health spending slowdown that occurred in the period 2000-10. Our analysis of the account reveals that the slowdown was driven by a reduction of growth in cost per case but that spending trends varied greatly across conditions and differentially affected the slowdown. More than half of the overall slowdown was accounted for by a slowdown in spending on circulatory conditions. However, there were more dramatic slowdowns in spending on categories such as endocrine system and musculoskeletal conditions than in spending on other categories, such as cancers.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26733711/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      To understand the impact of changes in physician market structure on clinical outcomes and health care utilization.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      2005-2012 Medicare fee-for-service claims and enrollment data.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      We consider the effect of cardiology market structure on utilization and health outcomes for four patient populations. We estimate the risk-adjusted impact of competition using multivariate regression models.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      The study finds that an increase in consolidation leads to statistically and economically significant increases in negative health outcomes. For example, we find that moving from a zip code at the 25th percentile of cardiology market concentration to one at the 75th percentile would be associated with 5 to 7 percent increases in risk-adjusted mortality for three of the sample populations. We also found higher expenditures in more concentrated markets. For example, moving from a zip code at the 25th percentile of cardiology market concentration to one at the 75th would be associated with 7 to 11 percent increases in expenditures, depending on sample population.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our estimates indicate that increases in cardiology market concentration are associated with worse health outcomes and higher health care expenditures.

"Inflammatory bowel diseases, although they are uncommon and rarely fatal, typically present during the period of economically productive adult life. Patients may require extensive therapeutic intervention as a result of the chronic, relapsing nature of the diseases. Their medical management includes oral and topical 5-amino salicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids, as well as antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapies. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of rival treatments requires valid, reliable global assessments of outcome which consider quality of life, as well as the usual clinical end-points. Macro-economic studies of the overall impact of inflammatory bowel disease on health care systems have so far been largely confined to North America, where the total annual US costs, both direct and indirect, incurred by the estimated 380 000-480 000 sufferers has been put at around US2bn. Drugs were estimated to account for only 10% of total costs, whereas surgery and hospitalization account for approximately half. Studies from Europe suggest that the proportion of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis who are capable of full time work is 75% and 90%, respectively. However, whilst only a minority of inflammatory bowel disease patients suffer chronic ill health and their life expectancy is normal, obtaining life assurance may be problematic, suggesting a misconception that inflammatory bowel disease frequently results in a major impact on an individual's economic productivity.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.1999.00437.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9892875/,economics

We find that when only provider effort is unobservable, to induce the first-best outcome the optimal compensation rule requires zero fee-for-service.

Reimbursement is an umbrella concept describing the process to manage and pay for healthcare services, including benefit coverage, coding, and payment processes. The technologies and services used in therapeutic temperature management are not directly reimbursed, leading to challenges by hospitals and physicians that the services are too expensive to use. The reimbursement models used in the United States make it increasingly difficult for new technologies and therapies to gain direct reimbursement, part of a strategy by insurers, including Medicare and private insurance companies, to manage access to health care services. Insurers, physicians, hospitals, and other providers face conflicting financial incentives in current reimbursement systems.

"To progress toward universal health coverage and promote inclusive social and economic development, it will be necessary to strengthen domestic resource mobilization for health. In this paper, we examine options for increasing domestic government revenue in low- and middle-income countries. We analyze the relationship between level of economic development and levels of government revenue and expenditure, and show that a country's level of economic development does not predetermine its spending levels. Government revenue can be increased through improved tax compliance and efficiency in revenue collection, maximizing revenue from mineral and other natural resources, and increasing tax rates where appropriate. The emphasis should be on increasing revenue through the most progressive means possible; the purpose of raising government spending on health would be defeated if that spending were funded by increasing the relative tax burden of those who are meant to benefit. Increasing government revenue through taxation or other sources is first and foremost a fiscal policy choice or political decision and should be supported through concerted global action.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133116000438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28332459/,economics

"Germany is known for its comprehensive health care coverage by sickness funds and private health insurers and its successful cost containment policy. The stabilization of health care expenditures as a percentage of GNP was enforced by five cost containment laws since 1977. The last one became effective in 1993 and the next ones are planned for 1996 and 2000. The 1993 law has initiated drastic changes of the system. Office based physicians will be paid by a mixture of capitation, fee-for-service and fees for combined service packages. The hospital financing will be transformed from the current per diem remuneration to a payment system where per diems are combined with payments based on diagnostic related groups and patient management categories. Up till now many restrictions exist for insurees to switch sickness funds. These limitations were removed by the 1993 law. To allow unbiased competition between sickness funds, a risk compensation pool, some kind of statutory reinsurance, will transfer financial resources from sickness funds with good risk structure to those with many bad risks. In many respects health policy has imposed what health economists have recommended for a long time. However, there is some doubt whether increased competition will really increase efficiency of providing medical care because it takes place in a highly regulated market.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)90241-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7863359/,economics
"Almost 40 years have passed since Georgescu-Roegen's seminal work, The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. During this time there has been much debate on the relevance of thermodynamics to economics, and many attempts to build bridges between the two. There has also been much confusion as to what the laws of thermodynamics actually say. This article clearly explains heat, work, and the thermodynamic laws, the meaning of entropy, and the importance of kinetics as a barrier to thermodynamically favorable processes. The two most important misunderstandings in the literature, namely entropy as disorder, and entropy as a measure of information, are highlighted. Reviewing the literature shows that thermodynamics is most relevant for building a descriptive model, or preanalytic vision of economics, because it implies physical constraints on production and consumption. Similarly, it suggests that there may be serious flaws with neoclassical economic models, and in particular the primacy of sustained growth. However, thermodynamics does not seem to aid mathematical modeling in economics, nor does it provide normative insights. As an aid to energy policy, thermodynamics is useful for assessing the feasibility of technology options--those that have the potential to meet our goals, and should be counted as options, and those that should not. But it does not provide a prescription outside of this technical realm. Factors, such as environmental impact, cost, and social acceptability, will ultimately determine which technically feasible options are most desirable.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05166.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20146759/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In case of orphan drugs applicability of the standard health technology assessment (HTA) process is limited due to scarcity of good clinical and health economic evidence. Financing these premium priced drugs is more controversial in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region where the public funding resources are more restricted, and health economic justification should be an even more important aspect of policy decisions than in higher income European countries.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To explore and summarize the recent scientific evidence on value drivers related to the health technology assessment of ODs with a special focus on the perspective of third party payers in CEE countries. The review aims to list all potentially relevant value drivers in the reimbursement process of orphan drugs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review was performed; PubMed and Scopus databases were systematically searched for relevant publications until April 2015. Extracted data were summarized along key HTA elements.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From the 2664 identified publications, 87 contained relevant information on the evaluation criteria of orphan drugs, but only 5 had direct information from the CEE region. The presentation of good clinical evidence seems to play a key role especially since this should be the basis of cost-effectiveness analyses, which have more importance in resource-constrained economies. Due to external price referencing of pharmaceuticals, the relative budget impact of orphan drugs is expected to be higher in CEE than in Western European (WE) countries unless accessibility of patients remains more limited in poorer European regions. Equity principles based on disease prevalence and non-availability of alternative treatment options may increase the price premium, however, societies must have some control on prices and a rationale based on multiple criteria in reimbursement decisions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The evaluation of orphan medicines should include multiple criteria to appropriately measure the clinical added value of orphan drugs. The search found only a small number of studies coming from CEE, therefore European policies on orphan drugs may be based largely on experiences in WE countries. More research should be done in the future in CEE because financing high-priced orphan drugs involves a greater burden for these countries.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-016-0455-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27259284/,economics
"Health economics is a science of efficient use of medical resources. Economic evaluation deals with both inputs or costs and outputs or consequences and is done when there are choices. The inputs or costs can be direct, indirect or intangible. The consequences can be measured as natural health units or utilities which aggregate multiple health units or quality adjusted life years. In the current health care scenario in India the cost data is usually lacking. An exact way for estimating the cost is elicitation of opportunity cost which is the value of time or input at its highest. The total cost is the cost of producing a particular quantity of the output and is made up of fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs do not vary with the quantity of output but variable costs do. In India, the total cost of health care provided by a multidisciplinary team can be estimated either by the 'per diem' approach which assumes no cost sharing by the departments, or by the allocation method which takes into account the quantity of service provided by each department and costs them individually. Cost effectiveness or utility and cost-benefit analysis are considered complete economic evaluation. Analyses are done from a pre-specified perspective which could be patients', payers', providers' or societal. Costs incurred at a later time are discounted. Such evaluations help us make informed decision to choose between various health interventions. Their increasing use in health research in the developing countries is needed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02820686,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10885208/,economics

"Using a recently introduced method to quantify the time-varying lead-lag dependencies between pairs of economic time series (the thermal optimal path method), we test two fundamental tenets of the theory of fixed income: (i) the stock market variations and the yield changes should be anti-correlated; (ii) the change in central bank rates, as a proxy of the monetary policy of the central bank, should be a predictor of the future stock market direction. Using both monthly and weekly data, we found very similar lead-lag dependence between the S&P 500 stock market index and the yields of bonds inside two groups: bond yields of short-term maturities (Federal funds rate (FFR), 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, and 3Y) and bond yields of long-term maturities (5Y, 7Y, 10Y, and 20Y). In all cases, we observe the opposite of (i) and (ii). First, the stock market and yields move in the same direction. Second, the stock market leads the yields, including especially the FFR. Moreover, we find that the short-term yields in the first group lead the long-term yields in the second group before the financial crisis that started in mid-2007 and the inverse relationship holds afterwards. These results suggest that the Federal Reserve is increasingly mindful of the stock market behavior, seen as key to the recovery and health of the economy. Long-term investors seem also to have been more reactive and mindful of the signals provided by the financial stock markets than the Federal Reserve itself after the start of the financial crisis. The lead of the S&P 500 stock market index over the bond yields of all maturities is confirmed by the traditional lagged cross-correlation analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022794,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21857954/,economics

We use a database of 1,237,528 continuously enrolled beneficiaries to quantify the payment impact of change in enrollee health status over time for enrollees with two common chronic illnesses, hypertension and diabetes. The payment impact caused by the change in enrollee health status across MCOs ranged from +3.67% to -7.27% for enrollees with diabetes and from +5.25% to -7.69% for enrollees with hypertension. The MCO payment impact for diabetes and hypertension ranged from +0.19% to -0.31%.

"Resistance to antimicrobial drugs is increasing worldwide. This resistance is, at least in part, associated with high antimicrobial usage. Despite increasing awareness, economists (and policy analysts more generally) have paid little attention to the problem. In this paper antimicrobial resistance is conceptualised as a negative externality associated with the consumption of antimicrobials and is set within the broader context of the costs and benefits associated with antimicrobial usage. It is difficult to determine the overall impact of attempting to reduce resistance, given the extremely limited ability to model the epidemiology of resistant and sensitive micro-organisms. It is assumed for the purposes of the paper, however, that dealing with resistance by reducting antimicrobial usage would lead to a positive societal benefit. Three policy options traditionally associated with environmental economics (regulation, permits and charges) are examined in relation to their potential ability to impact upon the problem of resistance. The primary care sector of the U.K.'s National Health Service provides the context for this examination. Simple application of these policies to health care is likely to be problematic, with difficulties resulting particularly from the potential reduction in clinical freedom to prescribe when appropriate, and from the desire for equity in health care provision. The paper tentatively concludes that permits could offer the best policy response to antimicrobial resistance, with the caveat that empirical research is needed to develop the most practical and efficient system. This research must be conducted alongside the required epidemiological research.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(97)00132-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9464666/,economics

"Financial analytical models of waste management systems have often found that recycling costs exceed direct benefits, and in order to economically justify recycling activities, externalities such as household expenses or environmental impacts must be invoked. Certain more empirically based studies have also found that recycling is more expensive than disposal. Other work, both through models and surveys, have found differently. Here we present an empirical systems model, largely drawn from a suburban Long Island municipality. The model accounts for changes in distribution of effort as recycling tonnages displace disposal tonnages, and the seven different cases examined all show that curbside collection programs that manage up to between 31% and 37% of the waste stream should result in overall system savings. These savings accrue partially because of assumed cost differences in tip fees for recyclables and disposed wastes, and also because recycling can result in a more efficient, cost-effective collection program. These results imply that increases in recycling are justifiable due to cost-savings alone, not on more difficult to measure factors that may not impact program budgets.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23816311/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Individualized medicine (IM) is a rapidly evolving field that is associated with both visions of more effective care at lower costs and fears of highly priced, low-value interventions. It is unclear which view is supported by the current evidence.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our objective was to systematically review the health economic evidence related to IM and to derive general statements on its cost-effectiveness.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      A literature search of MEDLINE database for English- and German-language studies was conducted.
    


          Study appraisal and synthesis method:
        
      
      Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies for technologies meeting the MEDLINE medical subject headings (MeSH) definition of IM (genetically targeted interventions) were reviewed. This was followed by a standardized extraction of general study characteristics and cost-effectiveness results.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most of the 84 studies included in the synthesis were from the USA (n = 43, 51 %), cost-utility studies (n = 66, 79 %), and published since 2005 (n = 60, 71 %). The results ranged from dominant to dominated. The median value (cost-utility studies) was calculated to be rounded $US22,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (adjusted to $US, year 2008 values), which is equal to the rounded median cost-effectiveness in the peer-reviewed English-language literature according to a recent review. Many studies reported more than one strategy of IM with highly varying cost-effectiveness ratios. Generally, results differed according to test type, and tests for disease prognosis or screening appeared to be more favorable than tests to stratify patients by response or by risk of adverse effects. However, these results were not significant.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Different definitions of IM could have been used. Quality assessment of the studies was restricted to analyzing transparency.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      IM neither seems to display superior cost-effectiveness than other types of medical interventions nor to be economically inferior. Instead, rather than 'whether' healthcare was individualized, the question of 'how' it was individualized was of economic relevance.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0143-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24574059/,economics
"The aims of this paper are to evaluate the risk equalisation (RE) arrangement in Australia's private health insurance against practices in other countries with similar arrangements and to propose ways of improving the system to advance economic efficiency and solidarity. Possible regulatory responses to insurance market failures are reviewed based on standard economic arguments. We describe various regulatory strategies used elsewhere to identify essential system features against which the Australian system is compared. Our results reveal that RE is preferred over alternative regulatory strategies such as premium rate restrictions, premium compensation and claims equalisation. Compared with some countries' practices, the calculated risk factors in Australia should be enhanced with further demographic, social and economic factors and indicators of long-term health issues. Other coveted features include prospective calculation and annual clearing of equalisation payments. Australia currently operates with a crude mechanism for RE in which the scheme incentivises insurers to select on risk rather than focusing on efficiency and equity-promoting actions.

"Reducing the frequency of multiple pregnancies would help to prevent prematurity associated with multiple births. Premature newborns may require extensive and costly medical interventions. Long-term disability also involves health, social and educational services during childhood, which may cost ten-fold more for twin than singleton births. On average, the known costs for twin births are four times higher than singleton births and triplet births are ten times higher than singleton births. Single embryo transfer (SET) can reduce the burden of illness due to multiple births. For good prognosis patients, the experimental evidence supports the transfer of a single embryo to reduce the burden of illness due to multiple birth and prematurity. Similar evidence suggests that the cost saving could support additional treatment cycles involving SET cycles. The findings have been confirmed by the beneficial outcome of a new health policy in Belgium, which allowed more reimbursement for assisted reproduction cycles in which transfer strategies aimed to reduce multiple birth rates.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s1472-6483(10)62249-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18598607/,economics

The group communicated by E-mail and face-to-face meetings. A literature review of decision makers' attitudes toward PE/HE studies and published economic evaluation guidelines was undertaken. In addition, a focus group discussion was held with opinion leaders in managed care pharmacy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The literature review identified 16 surveys of decision makers' attitudes toward PE/HE studies and 15 published guidelines that outlined reporting requirements for economic evaluations. These were reviewed and classified. Based on the published literature and comments from decision makers, seven additional reporting requirements for studies were specified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While the Task Force's additional reporting requirements may be helpful to decision makers, they raise a number of issues. These include the feasibility of meeting the additional requirements, whether decision makers should receive more education in economic evaluation, and whether there should be more study of health-care decision-making procedures themselves.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1524-4733.2003.64245.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12859580/,economics
The cost of school dental care provided by the South Australian School Dental Service is compared with the cost of funding similar care through an hypothetical alternative based on fee-for-service. The results of both cost-benefit and cost-effective analysis suggest that the school dental programme is an economically acceptable method of delivering school dental care.,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1834-7819.1978.tb02901.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/101188/,economics
"While evidence suggests that within specific cancer sites centralisation of services improves outcomes and quality of care, the economic impact of centralisation is unclear. This systematic review identified 19 studies that have investigated whether or not the centralisation of cancer services results in economies of scale, or is cost-effective, or increases the costs of accessing care for patients and their carers. Evidence from 13 studies suggests that increasing surgeon volumes are associated with cost reductions, although one study suggested that this relationship is U-shaped and the evidence is not consistent for hospital volumes and costs. Only one study demonstrated that centralisation was cost-effective with an incremental cost utility ratio of $5029 (€3616) per quality-adjusted life year gained. Consistent evidence from four studies suggested that centralised services increase the costs of accessing care for patients and their carers. Current evidence on the economic impact of centralisation of cancer services is limited and of poor quality. Therefore, it remains unclear whether centralisation results in economies of scale and is cost-effective. Future research should be based on a clear definition of the different components of centralisation in order to determine which aspects of centralisation are efficient and for which cancer subgroups.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2354.2011.01323.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22229484/,economics
"The Affordable Care Act will expand insurance coverage to more than twenty-five million Americans, partly through subsidized private insurance available from newly created health insurance exchanges for people with incomes of 133-400 percent of the federal poverty level. The act will alter the financial incentive structure for employers and influence their decisions on whether or not to offer their employees coverage. These decisions, in turn, will affect federal outlays and revenues through several mechanisms. We model the sensitivity of federal costs for the insurance exchange coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act using the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data set. We assess revenues and subsidy outlays for premiums and cost sharing for individuals purchasing private insurance through exchanges. Our findings show that changing theoretical premium contribution levels by just $100 could induce 2.25 million individuals to transition to exchanges and increase federal outlays by $6.7 billion. Policy makers and analysts should pay especially careful attention to participation rates as the act's implementation continues.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0522,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24019356/,economics
"Liquid markets are driven by information asymmetries and the injection of new information in trades into market prices. Where market matching uses an electronic limit order book (LOB), limit orders traders may make suboptimal price and trade decisions based on new but incomplete information arriving with market orders. This paper measures the information asymmetries in Bitcoin trading limit order books on the Kraken platform, and compares these to prior studies on equities LOB markets. In limit order book markets, traders have the option of waiting to supply liquidity through limit orders, or immediately demanding liquidity through market orders or aggressively priced limit orders. In my multivariate analysis, I control for volatility, trading volume, trading intensity and order imbalance to isolate the effect of trade informativeness on book liquidity. The current research offers the first empirical study of Glosten (1994) to yield a positive, and credibly large transaction cost parameter. Trade and LOB datasets in this study were several orders of magnitude larger than any of the prior studies. Given the poor small sample properties of GMM, it is likely that this substantial increase in size of datasets is essential for validating the model. The research strongly supports Glosten's seminal theoretical model of limit order book markets, showing that these are valid models of Bitcoin markets. This research empirically tested and confirmed trade informativeness as a prime driver of market liquidity in the Bitcoin market.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255515,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34384100/,economics
"Aim:
        
      
      To estimate the cost of management of acute primary angle closure glaucoma in Singapore.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this cost analysis using retrospective data, the authors performed a MEDLINE search of published papers on acute primary angle closure glaucoma (APACG) in Singapore. Using information from published data, clinical management pathways were constructed and clinical outcomes identified. For each management path, costs of medical treatment, hospitalization, clinic charges, investigations, laser treatment and surgery were identified and accounted over a 5-year treatment period, using year 2002 rates.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Given that, in Singapore, APACG affects 12.2 per 100,000 per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.5-13.9) in those aged 30 and older, each annual cohort would need to pay 261,741.78 US dollars (95%CI: US$225 310.90-298 265.10) or 287,560.26 US dollars (95%CI: 247,274.04-330,624.84 US dollars), if inclusive of cataract surgery, over 5 years after the episode of APACG. In this period, individuals would have to commit between 879.45 US dollars and 2576.39 US dollars, depending on the complexity of disease and accompanying cataract surgery.

"Physicians are faced with a burgeoning literature of economic studies. However, most physicians have little training in evaluating economic research. Economic studies involve a comparison of the costs and benefits of alternative treatment options. To be of use for medical decision making, they should meet appropriate methodological standards. These include clear specification of the research question and the perspective from which the study is being undertaken, comparison of relevant treatment options, identification and quantification of all important costs and benefits, the use of discounting to allow for time preferences for costs and benefits, and sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the study's results. Unfortunately, not all adhere to these principles. Physicians need to be able to understand and critically assess the quality of economic studies, and the applicability of the results to their own situation, in order to participate in medical policy decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1008292128615,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9653486/,economics
"In-office laboratory testing offers physicians an opportunity to increase their incomes through the potential profit available from technical services. This financial incentive for in-office testing has been altered by Medicare limits on physician payment, legislative changes in physicians' ability to bill Medicare for laboratory tests, and technological advances in office laboratory equipment. While restrictions on payment may make laboratory testing relatively less profitable than other technical services offered in the physician's office, in-office laboratory testing still offers potential financial benefit to physicians, particularly if they can influence the demand for tests. Economic theory suggests that physicians may be able to increase the demand for their services, including laboratory testing, but empirical data are not conclusive. As Medicare and other third-party payers consider fundamental reform in physician payment, the effect of different payment schemes on physicians' use of laboratory tests may have important consequences for physicians' income, the quality of care, patients' access to care, and the cost of the Medicare program.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.258.6.803,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3302324/,economics

"In this paper, we present a simple model of health insurance with asymmetric information, where we compare two alternative ways of organizing the insurance market. Either as a competitive insurance market, where some risks remain uninsured, or as a compulsory scheme, where however, the level of reimbursement of loss is to be determined by majority decision. In a simple welfare comparison, the compulsory scheme may in certain environments yield a solution which is inferior to that obtained in the market. We further consider the situation where the compulsory scheme may be supplemented by voluntary competitive insurance; this situation turns out to be at least as good as either of the alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(02)00062-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12349880/,economics
"Health care economic analyses are becoming increasingly important in the evaluation of health care interventions, including many within ophthalmology. Encompassed with the realm of health care economic studies are cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-minimization analysis, and cost-utility analysis. Cost-utility analysis is the most sophisticated form of economic analysis and typically incorporates utility values. Utility values measure the preference for a health state and range from 0.0 (death) to 1.0 (perfect health). When the change in utility measures conferred by a health care intervention is multiplied by the duration of the benefit, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from the intervention is ascertained. This methodology incorporates both the improvement in quality of life and/or length of life, or the value, occurring as a result of the intervention. This improvement in value can then be amalgamated with discounted costs to yield expenditures per quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY) gained. $/QALY gained is a measure that allows a comparison of the patient-perceived value of virtually all health care interventions for the dollars expended. A review of the literature on health care economic analyses, with particular emphasis on cost-utility analysis, is included in the present review. It is anticipated that cost-utility analysis will play a major role in health care within the coming decade.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0039-6257(02)00457-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12686305/,economics
"Economic and policy arrangements assure the maintenance of gender-based inequities throughout the life cycle. To understand the economics of aging requires consideration of the problems of women of all ages, commencing early in the adult life cycle when the different social roles and opportunity structures available to men and women take effect. Because the economic inequities suffered by women in old age derive principally from inequities suffered earlier as wives and workers, public policy focused on redressing income in old age does nothing to alter the structural basis of inequity. This article examines factors underlying the economics of aging for older women in the United States; delineates the relation between women's roles, social policy, and income; and raises salient policy questions for younger and older women.",https://doi.org/10.2190/wrxh-6fub-344q-970b,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6715094/,economics
"A specific net present value (SNPV) approach is introduced as a criterion in economic engineering decisions. The SNPV expresses average costs, including the growth rate and plant utilisation over the planning horizon, factors that are excluded from a standard net present value approach. The use of SNPV favours alternatives that are cheaper per service unit and are therefore closer to the costs that a user has to cover. It also shows that demand growth has a similar influence on average costs as an economy of scale. In a high growth scenario, solutions providing less idle capacity can have higher present value costs and still be economically favourable. The SNPV approach is applied in two examples to calculate acceptable additional costs for modularisation and comparable costs for on-site treatment (OST) as an extreme form of modularisation. The calculations show that: (i) the SNPV approach is suitable for quantifying the comparable costs of an OST system in a different scenario; (ii) small systems with projected high demand growth rates and high real interest rates are the most probable entry market for OST water treatment systems; (iii) operating expenses are currently the main economic weakness of membrane-based wastewater OST systems; and (iv) when high growth in demand is expected, up to 100% can be additionally invested in modularisation and staging the expansion of a treatment plant.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2009.02.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19272630/,economics
"Our objective was to institute a cost-effectiveness-based reimbursement eligibility and coverage scheme for drugs in the Canadian province of British Columbia. All applications from drug manufacturers requesting Pharmacare (British Columbia government-funded drug insurance plan) coverage were evaluated by the Pharmacoeconomic Initiative (PI) of British Columbia. PI recommendations are according to a majority decision reached by a multidisciplinary volunteer expert committee and are based on a critical evaluation of pharmacoeconomic studies submitted by manufacturers seeking reimbursement eligibility. Coverage for drugs is universal and completely free for the financially indigent. Others are charged a small copayment and/or a deductible. PI assessments are evidence-based. Published guidelines from the Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment (CCOHTA) and/or Ontario Ministry of Health guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals are recommended for preparing submissions to the PI. Between January 1996 and December 1996, the PI made recommendations on 21 submissions; 4 of these were cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses; 3 were cost-minimisation analyses; 6 were cost comparisons or cost-consequence analyses; and 8 were provincial formulary budget impact studies. Of the 21 PI recommendations, 18 were accepted by Pharmacare and decisions are pending for 2 others, thus providing a concordance rate of 95% (18/19; kappa = 0.89). A total of 7 of the 21 products were recommended for formulary inclusion by the PI; 4 were as per drug company requests (i.e. full-benefit status) and 3 were recommended under restricted use. Only 5 of 21 submissions, of which 4 had favourable reviews, complied with either the CCOHTA or the Ontario Ministry of Health guidelines. Most studies were conducted, not from a societal perspective, but from the perspective of the provincial healthcare system. Most of the analysis were short term and therefore discounting was not applied. Sensitivity analysis was not performed in more than half (52%) of the submissions, and 48% of applications used inappropriate comparators. Ontario is the only other Canadian province with a similar process, with cost-effectiveness criteria for reimbursement eligibility. However, analysis in that province during the same approximate time period demonstrated a low concordance between Ontario Drug Benefit and PI decisions (kappa = 0.07). Currently, the mandated or suggested use of technology assessments of pharmaceuticals with cost effectiveness as the primary end-point is a reality in several countries worldwide. Our results, based on actual experience from implementing such a programme, suggest that while industry is slow to adapt to the new reporting requirements it may also be sceptical about the importance of cost effectiveness and guideline compliance in decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199813010-00011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10176146/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In many healthcare systems, affordability concerns can lead to restrictions on the use of expensive efficacious therapies. However, there does not appear to be any consensus as to the terminology used to describe affordability, or the thresholds used to determine whether new drugs are affordable.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this systematic review was to investigate how affordability is defined and measured in healthcare.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE, EMBASE and EconLit databases (2005-July 2016) were searched using terms covering affordability and budget impact, combined with definitions, thresholds and restrictions, to identify articles describing a definition of affordability with respect to new medicines. Additional definitions were identified through citation searching, and through manual searches of European health technology assessment body websites.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 27 definitions were included in the review. Of these, five definitions described affordability in terms of the value of a product; seven considered affordability within the context of healthcare system budgets; and 15 addressed whether products are affordable in a given country based on economic factors. However, there was little in the literature to indicate that the price of medicines is considered alongside both their value to individual patients and their budget impact at a population level.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Current methods of assessing affordability in healthcare may be limited by their focus on budget impact. A more effective approach may involve a broader perspective than is currently described in the literature, to consider the long-term benefits of a therapy and cost savings elsewhere in the healthcare system, as well as cooperation between healthcare payers and the pharmaceutical industry to develop financing models that support sustainability as well as innovation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-017-0514-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28477220/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      This systematic review examines healthcare costs associated with mental health conditions among cancer survivors in the United States.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      Ten published studies were identified. Studies varied substantially in terms of population, mental health conditions examined, data collection methods, and type of cost reported. Cancer survivors with mental health conditions incurred significantly higher total medical costs and costs of most service types compared to cancer survivors without a mental health condition. Additionally, the total healthcare expenditure related to mental health was higher among cancer survivors compared with people without history of cancer.
    


          Expert commentary:
        
      
      Mental health conditions are associated with increased healthcare costs among cancer survivors. Future examination of other components of economic burden, including patient out-of-pocket costs, nonmedical costs, such as transportation, childcare, and productivity losses for patients and their caregivers, will be important. Additionally, evaluation of economic burden by cancer site, stage at diagnosis, duration of survivorship, and treatment(s) will increase understanding of the overall impact of mental health conditions on cancer survivors and on the healthcare system.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2018.1485097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29869568/,economics
"The basis for the argument in favour of the internal market as a means of allocating resources within the health care sector has never been made fully explicit. In particular, the link between the economic theory of market allocation and the specific pricing rules adopted by a number of health care sectors to allocate resources is rarely a focus of attention. Health sector objectives are rarely specified. The mechanisms which remedy failure in the exchange process are not explicitly defined. In short, the optimal structural conditions for the operation of internal markets are not known. The central argument pursued here is that, as this is the case, and using the UK as an example, there are no criteria to which purchasers or providers can turn to assess the operation of exchange within the internal market. Not surprisingly, the internal market dissolves into a number of individual bilateral agreements between purchasers and providers which may or may not increase efficiency in allocating health sector resources.",https://doi.org/10.1177/135581969600100112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180847/,economics

"This paper puts health questions within the context of national development and industrial policy. It follows the idea of structuralist, Marxist and Schumpeterian approaches, in which industry and innovations form determining factors for the dynamism in capitalist economies and relative positions within the world economy. All countries that have developed and started to compete under better conditions with advanced countries have had an association between strong industry and an endogenous knowledge, learning and innovation base. However, in the field of health, this vision presents problems because business interests move according to the economic logic of profit rather than to meet health needs. The notion of the health-industrial complex is an attempt to provide a theoretical reference that enables linkage between two distinct types of logic: health and economic development. This study has sought to show, on the basis of foreign trade data, how disregard for the logic of health policy development has led to a situation of economic vulnerability in this sector, which may limit the objectives of universality, equality and comprehensiveness. Within this context, a cognitive and political break with these antagonistic visions that put health needs on one side and industrial needs on the other is proposed. A country that aims to reach a condition of development and independence requires strong innovative industries and an inclusive and universal health system, at the same time.",https://doi.org/10.1590/s0034-89102006000400003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16924298/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In 2005, the American Journal of Public Health published an article that indicated that 22% of the overall decline in youth smoking that occurred between 1999 and 2002 was directly attributable to the truth social marketing campaign launched in 2000. A remaining key question about the truth campaign is whether the economic investment in the program can be justified by the public health outcomes; that question is examined here.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Standard methods of cost and cost-utility analysis were employed in accordance with the U.S. Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine; a societal perspective was employed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During 2000-2002, expenditures totaled just over $324 million to develop, deliver, evaluate, and litigate the truth campaign. The base-case cost-utility analysis result indicates that the campaign was cost saving; it is estimated that the campaign recouped its costs and that just under $1.9 billion in medical costs was averted for society. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the basic determination of cost effectiveness for this campaign is robust to substantial variation in input parameters.

"This article analyzes four major assumptions that guide the Reagan Administration's health policies: 1) the Administration received an overwhelming popular mandate to reduce the federal role in the U.S. health sector; 2) the size and growth of federal social (including health) expenditures are contributing to the current economic recession; 3) the costs to business of federally imposed health and safety regulations have contributed to making the U.S. economy less competitive; and 4) market intervention is intrinsically more efficient than government intervention in regulating the costs and distribution of health resources. Based on these assumptions, the main characteristics of the Reagan Administration's health policies have been 1) a reduction of federal health expenditures and, very much in particular, expenditures to the poor, handicapped, and elderly; 2) a weakening of federal health and safety regulations to protect workers, consumers, and the environment; and 3) the further privatization and commodification of medical services. This article shows that there is no evidence to support the assumptions on which these policies are based. Quite to the contrary, all available evidence shows the opposite: 1) the majority of Americans want an expansion of federal health expenditures and a strengthening of federal health regulation; 2) U.S. government expenditures and regulations are much more limited than those of other countries whose economies are performing more satisfactorily; and 3) those countries with larger government interventions have more efficient health care systems than the American one, where the ""free market"" forces are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources. Thus, major Reagan Administration health policies are based on myth rather than reality.",https://doi.org/10.2190/d5vk-lh3t-lbje-mj0l,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6429061/,economics
"This paper updates tests of the validity of three models of medical price inflation: a standard model, in which changes in demand press against inelastic supply; a dynamic version of the standard model, in which high levels of insurance induce high rates of product innovation and development; and a model of increasing inefficiency, in which consumers have weak incentives to search out efficient suppliers. Earlier statistical support for the third model has weakened, which provides some evidence that the regulatory and competitive initiatives of the last decade are having their intended effects. But time series measures of medical prices upon which the statistical evidence relies have important methodological problems, so other types of evidence are useful. Trends in expenditure in other countries and in HMOs suggest that the most important explanation of medical price inflation is the dynamic version of the standard model, although the other models have some validity as well.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-13-2-263,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3385168/,economics
"The issues surrounding screening mammography present apparent conflicts: conflicting guidelines for screening; an oversupply of facilities, yet inadequate access to mammography for some groups of women; increased medicolegal vulnerability as participation in screening is promoted; disparate results from studies of cost-effectiveness; wide variations in delivery modes and practice patterns of facilities, yet an evolution toward a single set price for mammography by payers for screening. This review does not claim to offer solutions to these conflicts, rather it attempts to carry forward a discussion of the issues. With these conflicts, screening mammography may be only a microcosm of similar economic issues in general health care delivery. Our health care system has room for variety, if access and quality are improved at an affordable cost.

Here we consider the consumer society as it currently exists in the UK and examine its relationship and relevance to the population of individuals with intellectual disability. We do this through a reading of the associated literature on theories of shopping and consumption which we then contrast with research evidence as it applies to the lives of people with intellectual disability. By brining together these two perspectives we hope to shine some light on ideas around identity and choice. We then transfer these arguments to the health and social care sector. Here we ask whether an economic model which has been exposed as divisive and exclusionary should be used in the administration of social secutity benefits of the kind accesed by people with a range of disabilities. We conclude that the unchallenged advance of marketisation within health and social care may benefit those who are financially able but for those who are economically disadvantaged the choices offered are illusory at best.,https://doi.org/10.1177/1744629512445844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22544482/,economics

"Reference pricing intends to reduce pharmaceutical expenditures by increasing demand elasticity and stimulating generic competition. We develop a novel model where a brand-name producer competes in prices with several generics producers in a market with brand-biased and brand-neutral consumers. Comparing with coinsurance, we show that reference pricing, contrary to policy makers' intentions, discourages generic entry, as it induces the brand-name producer to price more aggressively. Thus, the net effect of reference pricing on drug prices is ambiguous, implying that reference pricing can be counterproductive in reducing expenditures. However, under price regulation, we show that reference pricing may stimulate generic entry, since a binding price cap weakens the aggressive price response by the brand-name producer. This may explain mixed empirical results on the competitive effects of reference pricing. Finally, we show that reference pricing may be welfare improving when accounting for brand preferences despite its adverse effects on entry and prices.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.04.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27350294/,economics

          Method:
        
      
      Evidence from a number of countries was examined, both published and unpublished, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses were consulted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The costs of schizophrenia are high and wide-ranging. They fall not only to health-care agencies but also to other parts of the public sector, to families, to sufferers themselves and to the wider society. However, there are interventions--a counselling intervention to address non-compliance with medication, family interventions to reduce levels of expressed emotion, and atypical antipsychotic drugs--that have been found to be not only effective (improving patient outcomes) but also appear to be cost-effective.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Resource constraints and policy pressures make it increasingly common for economic as well as clinical questions to be asked about new modes of treatment. This is the new reality of mental health practice. Reliable evidence is now available to address these economic questions and can be factored into decision-making processes.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-0658.2001.00137.x-i1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11261634/,economics
"This paper describes the construction of a model of the Dutch health care sector. It discusses the behaviour of patients, general practitioners, medical specialists and hospital managers. It also analyses the various ways the actors interact, such as general practitioners supplying the services demanded by patients, specialists dispatching referrals made by general practitioners or hospital managers boosting output to match an increasing amount of specialist services. Numerical simulations illustrate the various mechanisms in the model.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199707)6:4<351::aid-hec274>3.0.co;2-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9285229/,economics
"This paper describes the early experience of the Health Insurance Plan of California (the HIPC), a small-employer purchasing cooperative established in 1993. The plan's experience is consistent with the predictions of advocates of market-oriented health care reform: The program's design has encouraged cost-conscious choice by enrollees, which in turn has generated price competition among plans. Differences across the HIPC's six rating regions conform with the notion that health care competition is less viable is sparsely populated areas. Evidence on risk selection suggests that while the HIPC as a whole has not experienced adverse selection, certain plans within the program have received a disproportionate share of high-cost enrollees.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.16.2.218,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9086671/,economics
"The potential for parallel trade in the European Union (EU) has grown with the accession of low price countries and the harmonisation of registration requirements. Parallel trade implies a conflict between the principle of autonomy of member states to set their own pharmaceutical prices, the principle of free trade and the industrial policy goal of promoting innovative research and development (R&D). Parallel trade in pharmaceuticals does not yield the normal efficiency gains from trade because countries achieve low pharmaceutical prices by aggressive regulation, not through superior efficiency. In fact, parallel trade reduces economic welfare by undermining price differentials between markets. Pharmaceutical R&D is a global joint cost of serving all consumers worldwide; it accounts for roughly 30% of total costs. Optimal (welfare maximising) pricing to cover joint costs (Ramsey pricing) requires setting different prices in different markets, based on inverse demand elasticities. By contrast, parallel trade and regulation based on international price comparisons tend to force price convergence across markets. In response, manufacturers attempt to set a uniform 'euro' price. The primary losers from 'euro' pricing will be consumers in low income countries who will face higher prices or loss of access to new drugs. In the long run, even higher income countries are likely to be worse off with uniform prices, because fewer drugs will be developed. One policy option to preserve price differentials is to exempt on-patent products from parallel trade. An alternative is confidential contracting between individual manufacturers and governments to provide country-specific ex post discounts from the single 'euro' wholesale price, similar to rebates used by managed care in the US. This would preserve differentials in transactions prices even if parallel trade forces convergence of wholesale prices.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199813030-00004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10178655/,economics
"Technological progress in the field of cancer treatment can be expected to accelerate in the future, giving hope to such patients. At the same time, there is concern that cancer care will become more expensive. It is indispensable to minimize the economic burden of patients to deliver technological advances in treatment. It is important for the physician engaged in cancer care to recognize the economic burden of patients and to reduce this burden as much as possible. The Cancer Control Act was enacted in 2007 to promote work on cancer control using all the resources of the nation, and this should surely entail financial support. In order to take advantage of innovations in cancer care, reform of the payment system to lighten the economic burden of the patient would be a pressing necessity.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jjco/hyt015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23423810/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      Cardiac surgery has seen substantial scientific progress over recent decades. Health economic evaluations have become important tools for decision makers to prioritize scarce health resources. The present study aimed to identify and critically appraise the reporting quality of health economic evaluations conducted in the field of cardiac surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was performed to identify health economic evaluations in cardiac surgery. The consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement was used to assess the quality of reporting of studies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total 4,705 articles published between 1981 and 2016 were identified; sixty-nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was a trend toward a greater number of publications and reporting quality over time. Six (8.7 percent) studies were conducted between 1981 and 1990, nine (13 percent) between 1991 and 2000, twenty-four (34.8 percent) between 2001 and 2010, and thirty (43.5 percent) after 2011. The mean CHEERS score of all articles was 16.7/24; for those published between 1980 and 1990 the mean (SD) score was 10.2 (±1.4), for those published between 1991 and 2000 it was 11.2 (±2.4), between 2001 and 2010 it was 15.3 (±4.8), and after 2011 it was 19.9 (±2.9). The quality of reporting was still insufficient for several studies after 2000, especially concerning items ""characterizing heterogeneity,"" ""assumptions,"" and ""choice of model.""
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The present study suggests that, even if the quantity and the quality of health economics evaluation in cardiac surgery has increased, there remains a need for improvement in several reporting criteria to ensure greater transparency.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462318003768,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744730/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In middle income countries the number of trained health technology assessment specialists is limited and the public budget for health technology assessment is considerably lower compared to developed countries. These countries therefore must develop their own solutions to improve the quality and efficiency of health technology assessment implementation in reimbursement decisions. Our study aimed to develop a scientifically rigorous and detailed appraisal checklist for economic evaluations of pharmaceuticals in the single health technology assessment process.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The research design entailed a review of economic evaluations, submitted for reimbursement of pharmaceuticals, by two independent academic reviewers to identify the most common methodological problems. Fifty economic evaluations submitted in 2007-2008, randomly selected by the Health Technology Assessment Office served as data sources. The new checklist was developed by an iterative working process: first by assessing ten economic evaluations, then improving the checklist by generating new question items, then employing the improved checklist to assess the next ten economic evaluations. After appraising 25 documents, the reviewers reconciled their opinions and improved the checklist with the researchers of the Health Technology Assessment Office during an expert panel discussion. The reviewers scrutinized the second 25 economic evaluations, after which the expert panel finalized the checklist with consensus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The final checklist consists of 91 yes or no questions in 11 main topics concerning comparator selection, efficacy, effectiveness, costs, sensitivity analysis, methodological approach, transparency, and interpretation of results. The new checklist is based on current Hungarian evaluation practice. As the published checklist will be part of the official single health technology assessment process of pharmaceuticals, submitters will be able to assure the quality of their economic evaluation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The transparent critical appraisal method should improve the consistency of pharmaceutical reimbursement decisions and facilitate the utilization of economic evaluations in other fields of health care decision-making in other Central-Eastern European countries.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-12-332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22999574/,economics
"One goal of the Affordable Care Act is to increase insurance coverage by improving competition and lowering premiums. To facilitate this goal, the federal government enacted online marketplaces in the 395 rating areas spanning 34 states that chose not to establish their own state-run marketplaces. Few multivariate regression studies analyzing the effects of competition on premiums suffer from endogeneity, due to simultaneity and omitted variable biases. However, United Healthcare's decision to enter these marketplaces in 2015 provides the researcher with an opportunity to address this endogeneity problem. Exploiting the variation caused by United Healthcare's entry decision as an instrument for competition, we study the impact of competition on premiums during the first 2 years of these marketplaces. Combining panel data from five different sources and controlling for 12 variables, we find that one more insurer in a rating area leads to a 6.97% reduction in the second-lowest-priced silver plan premium, which is larger than the estimated effects in existing literature. Furthermore, we run a threshold analysis and find that competition's effects on premiums become statistically insignificant if there are four or more insurers in a rating area. These findings are robust to alternative measures of premiums, inclusion of a non-linear term in the regression models and a county-level analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133117000263,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306342/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to calculate the costs for clinical ultrasound examinations in Germany under defined economical aspects in a multicenter setting.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      There are fixed and variable costs for all common ultrasound examinations calculated under distinct scenarios for utilization and equipment quality (ultrasound systems classification concerning to DEGUM, German Ultrasound Society).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over 5 years (on average 2007 - 2011) depending on utilization and quality, the basic sonography costs were 131.30 - 171.39 Euros for contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and 57.06 - 77.10 Euros for ultrasound guided biopsy per examination. The costs were calculated at 54.84 - 74.88 Euros for endosonography of the lower GI tract, at 79.20 - 109.27 Euros for the upper GI tract without biopsy and at 226.18 - 367.97 Euros with biopsy depending on the needle used. The costs were 34.58 - 47.01 Euros for basic transthoracic echocardiography, 100.04 - 112.20 Euros for CEUS, and 106.15 - 134.29 Euros for the transesophageal approach.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Cost calculation under defined economical aspects leads to cost transparency for clinical ultrasound examinations. Echocardiography costs were calculated like this for the first time in Germany. Calculation based on fixed and variable cost aspects as well as using distinct scenarios enables prospective planning of resources and investment.

"Many studies have reported that air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has a significant impact on health and causes economic loss. Gansu Province is in the northwest of China, which is a typical economically underdeveloped area. However, few studies have evaluated the economic loss of PM2.5 related to health effects in this province. In this study, a log-linear exposure-response function was used to estimate the health impact of PM2.5 in 14 cities in Gansu Province from 2015 to 2017, and the amended human capital (AHC) and cost of illness (COI) method were used to evaluate the related economic loss caused by the health impact from PM2.5. The results show that the estimated total number of health endpoints attributed to PM2.5 pollution were 1,644,870 (95%CI: 978,484-2,215,921), 1,551,447 (95%CI: 917,025-2,099,182) and 1,531,372 (95%CI: 899,769-2,077,772) in Gansu Province from 2015 to 2017, respectively. Correspondingly, the economic losses related to health damage caused by PM2.5 pollution were 42,699 (95%CI: 32,380-50,768) million Chinese Yuan (CNY), 43,982 (95%CI: 33,305-52,386) million CNY and 44,261 (95%CI: 33,306-52,954) million CNY, which were equivalent to 6.45% (95%CI: 4.89%-7.67%), 6.28% (95%CI: 4.75%-7.48%), and 5.93% (95%CI: 4.64%-7.10%) of the region Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 2015 to 2017, respectively. It could be seen that the proportions of health economic loss to GDP were generally high, although the proportion had a slight downward trend. The economic loss from chronic bronchitis and all-cause mortality accounted for more than 94% of the total economic loss. The health impact, economic loss and per capita economic loss in Lanzhou, the provincial capital city of Gansu, were obviously higher than other cities from the same province. The economic loss in Linxia accounted for the highest proportion of GDP. The health impacts in the Hexi region, including the cities of Jiuquan, Jiayuguan, Zhangye, Jinchang and Wuwei, were generally lower, but the economic loss and per capita economic loss were still higher. We also found that urbanization and industrialization were highly correlated with health economic loss caused by PM2.5 pollution. In conclusion, the PM2.5-related health economic burden in Gansu Province was serious. As an economically underdeveloped region, it was very important to further adopt rigid and effective pollution control policies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093253,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32392731/,economics
"The paper contributes to the use of social choice and welfare theory in health economics by developing and applying the integration of claims framework to health-care rationing. Related to Sen's critique of neo-classical welfare economics, the integration of claims framework recognises three primitive sources of claim: consequences, deontology and procedures. A taxonomy is presented with the aid of which it is shown that social welfare functions reflecting these claims individually or together, can be specified. Some of the resulting social choice rules can be regarded as generalisations of health-maximisation and all have normative justifications, though the justifications may not be universally acceptable. The paper shows how non-linear programming can be used to operationalise such choice rules and illustrates their differential impacts on the optimal provision of health-care. Following discussion of relations to the capabilities framework and the context in which rationing occurs, the paper concludes that the integration of claims provides a viable framework for modelling health-care rationing that is technically rigorous, general and tractable, as well as being consistent with relevant moral considerations and citizen preferences.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(03)00024-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12946456/,economics
"Frequent claims suggest that healthcare and its production are not only different from other goods, but that they differ to such an extent that healthcare should be viewed as unique. Various features of healthcare, such as the lack of a perfect market and the existence of information asymmetry, are cited as evidence of this claim. However, such a view results from unduly emphasising the characteristics of healthcare as being atypical. This article redresses this imbalance by taking an alternative approach and examines the ways in which the economic aspects of healthcare are similar to those of other goods.

"Medication reviews is a widely accepted approach known to have a substantial impact on patients' pharmacotherapy and safety. Numerous options to optimise pharmacotherapy in older people have been reported in literature and they include medication reviews, computerised decision support systems, management teams, and educational approaches. Pharmacist-led medication reviews are increasingly being conducted, aimed at attaining patient safety and medication optimisation. Cost effectiveness is an essential aspect of a medication review evaluation. Areas covered: A systematic searching of articles that examined the cost-effectiveness of medication reviews conducted in aged care facilities was performed using the relevant databases. Pharmacist-led medication reviews confer many benefits such as attainment of biomarker targets for improved clinical outcomes, and other clinical parameters, as well as depict concrete financial advantages in terms of decrement in total medication costs and associated cost savings. Expert commentary: The cost-effectiveness of medication reviews are more consequential than ever before.

"An increase in stall stocking density (SSD), as measured by the number of lactating cows per stall in a freestall barn, reduces cow performance, such as milk yield and fertility, but may increase farm profitability. Our objectives were to calculate effects of varying SSD on profit per stall for a range of effects on cow performances and external farm factors and store results in regression metamodels. The literature on quantified effects of SSD on cow performance that directly affects cash flow was found to be weak. We assumed effects of SSD on milk yield, probability of conception, and probability of culling. External farm factors were probability of insemination, feed price, and milk price. A herd budget-simulation model was used which mimics the performance of cows in a herd and calculates profit per stall per year and other results. The SSD varied from 100 (no overstocking) to 150% (severe overstocking) in steps of 10%. Sensitivity analyses for effects of SSD on cow performance and effects of external farm factors were performed. Three regression metamodels were developed. The first metamodel accurately predicted profitability at 100% SSD for all variations in the external farm factors. Optimal SSD varied from 100 to 150% SSD, depending on the combination of inputs, and was very sensitive to changes in the size of the milk loss and milk and feed prices. Average optimal SSD of all 2,187 combinations of inputs was 120% SSD and average maximum increase in profit was $99/stall per year. Of the 2,187 combinations of inputs, 18% were ascending (maximum increase in profit >150% SSD), 33% were descending (maximum profit at 100% SSD), and 50% had a maximum increase in profit between 100 and 150% SSD. The second metamodel accurately captured changes in profit for all combinations of biological and external inputs and SSD. A third metamodel captured breakeven daily milk losses which would result in the same profit as at 100% SSD given the same external farm factors. In conclusion, overstocking was profitable under plausible economic conditions in the United States. The 3 metamodels accurately captured the results for a wide range of values of the input variables. A tradeoff will occur between economically optimal SSD and animal welfare in some situations.",https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-10556,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26923039/,economics
"In this paper we carry out a vertical differentiation duopoly model applied to pharmaceutical markets to analyze how endogenous and exogenous generic reference pricing influence competition between generic and branded drugs producers. Unlike the literature, we characterize for the exogenous case the equilibrium prices for all feasible relevant reference prices. Competition is enhanced after the introduction of a reference pricing system. We also compare both reference pricing systems on welfare grounds, assuming two different objective functions for health authorities: (i) standard social welfare and (ii) gross consumer surplus net of total pharmaceutical expenditures. We show that regardless of the objective function, health authorities will never choose endogenous reference pricing. When health authorities are paternalistic, the exogenous reference price that maximizes standard social welfare is such that the price of the generic drug is the reference price while the price of the branded drug is higher than the reference price. When health authorities are not paternalistic, the optimal exogenous reference price is such that the price of the branded drug is the reference price while the price of the generic drug is lower than the reference price.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-017-9216-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28508248/,economics
"Injuries pose an economic problem of immense proportion to communities in every society. The economic burden from injuries can be quantified through cost-of-injury studies, using techniques adopted from cost-of-illness research. This study explores the feasibility of applying results and methodologies from existing cost-of-injury studies in economic analyses of injury prevention interventions and programmes. The literature on cost-of-injury studies and economic appraisals of injury prevention efforts was examined to elicit studies that calculated injury costs. Studies were accepted for inclusion if they included an analysis of the costs of all injuries occurring in a geographical area (community, region or country) during a specific time period, employed a societal perspective and an incidence-based costing approach and were conducted in industrialized countries. There were 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The average total cost per injury case was USD $3536, while the average share of indirect to total cost per injury case was 71%. However, the cost figures showed wide variation across the studies. Based on the limited similarity of findings from the studies, it was concluded that it is not feasible to apply results and methodologies from existing cost-of-injury studies. The cost estimators described in this study could possibly be adapted for use as reference points in economic analyses of existing programmes, but any other uses should be approached with caution.

"Background:
        
      
      Health prepayment, a key indicator under the Sustainable Development Goals monitoring framework, is strongly associated with household financial protection; however, the impact of government health budget on the level of prepayment has rarely been discussed.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To address the following research questions. (1) Does a higher government health budget translate into higher prepayment rates in the healthcare financing system? (2) What are the effects of government health budget on public prepayment and private prepaid plans? (3) What are the heterogeneities between groups of countries with different income levels and public health prepayment systems?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Analysis of panel co-integration, impulse response function, and variance decomposition were conducted in 34 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members for the period 1995-2016.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Government health budget has a long-running equilibrium relationship with the level of public and total prepayment. However, a stable relationship could not be confirmed with private prepaid plans. Moreover, government health budget played a significant positive role in explaining the fluctuations in the total and public prepayments over a long time, that is, 51 and 37 periods, respectively. Considering differences between groups of countries, the impacts are greater for those with higher income levels and more public-dominated health-financing systems.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Government health budget has a long-time relationship with the levels of both total prepaid expenditure and public prepayment. By contrast, it does not systematically crowd out private prepaid plans.",https://doi.org/10.26719/emhj.20.108,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33538318/,economics
"These economic analyses differ widely in their methods and results because not only do they make different assumptions, they also consider different costs and apply different sensitivity analyses (to factors including costs). All of the economic analyses considered hospitalization costs and drug costs, not surprisingly, because these are the two main variables in the equation. Only the Dutch and UK studies, however, gave consideration to general practice costs, only the Dutch study included nursing home and district nursing costs, and only the UK study included initiation costs, monitoring costs and out-patient costs. Only the Dutch study attempted to make some allowance for indirect costs, although it was somewhat dismissive of their effects. The SOLVD study was the only one to attempt to estimate the direct costs of deaths and none of the studies made any attempt to estimate the indirect costs. With respect to sensitivity analysis, only the Dutch, UK, and USA studies examined the effect of varying the proposed efficacy of treatment, and all found the economic analysis to be sensitive to this variable; indeed, the Dutch study found it to be highly sensitive. The UK, USA, as well as SOLVD studies, examined the sensitivity of the analysis to varying hospital costs and all found it to be sensitive. The UK and USA studies found their analyses to be relatively insensitive to the effects of a discount rate. The USA study found greater sensitivity to varying mortality than the Dutch study.

"The origin of the obesity epidemic in developing countries is still poorly understood. It has been prominently argued that economic development provides a natural interpretation of the growth in obesity. This paper tests the main aggregated predictions of the theoretical framework to analyze obesity. Average body weight and health inequality should be associated with economic development. Both hypotheses are confirmed: we find higher average female body weight in economically more advanced countries. In relatively nondeveloped countries, obesity is a phenomenon of the socioeconomic elite. With economic development, obesity shifts toward individuals with lower socioeconomic status.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2968,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23873750/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate whether ostomy industry patent activity (PA) is associated with patient outcomes and healthcare costs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two groups of ostomy pouch users based on manufacturer PA (low or high) were compared in terms of ostomy-related wear patterns, adverse events, and healthcare expenditure. Using Swedish registry data, all patients with newly formed stomas were divided between each group and were followed during a 2-year period (2011-12). Propensity score matching and parametric duration analysis were used to compare outcomes between patients of similar characteristics such as sex, age, and ostomy surgery type.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In both one- and two-piece systems, the high PA group had significantly lower monthly ostomy-related expenditure than the low PA group (one-piece: 197.47 EUR versus 233.34 EUR; two-piece: 164.00 EUR versus 278.98 EUR). Fewer pouch and skin wafer purchases per month were an important driver of cost differences. Both groups had similar likelihood of purchasing dermatological products for skin complications over time.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PA in the ostomy care industry was associated with reduced healthcare costs, but not necessarily with fewer skin complications. It suggests that there is a health economic benefit from products made by patent intensive companies which may differentiate them from generic comparators, but more research is needed to understand the impact of activities conducive to medical innovation on health outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462317000435,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28655367/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Despite multiple studies comparing laparoscopic and open appendectomies, the clinically and economically superior procedure still is in question. A cost analysis was performed using both institutional and societal perspectives.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate laparoscopic and open appendectomies. The institutional perspective addressed direct health care costs, whereas the societal perspective addressed direct and indirect health care costs. Baseline values and ranges were taken from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and Medicare databases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From the institutional perspective, open appendectomy is the least expensive strategy, with an expected cost of $5,171, as compared with $6,118 for laparoscopic appendectomy. The laparoscopic approach is less expensive if open appendectomy wound infection rates exceed 23%. From the societal perspective, laparoscopic appendectomy is the least expensive strategy, with an expected cost of $10,400, as compared with $12,055 for open appendectomy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The decision analysis demonstrated an economic advantage to the hospital of open appendectomy. In contrast, laparoscopic appendectomy represents a better economic choice for the patient.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-004-8724-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15624056/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      As health care budgets continue to face close scrutiny, any new acquisition must be evaluated for both costs and outcomes. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the application of an economic framework for the evaluation of a multileaf collimator as an example of a new technology that can have both quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits for patients, staff, and cancer care institutions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using financial data from the Northeastern Ontario Regional Cancer Centre (NEORCC) and a recognized staffing model, a commercial spreadsheet, developed to economically characterize the principal radiotherapy processes has been used to determine the net incremental annual cost of a multileaf collimator (MLC).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The incremental annual cost of purchasing an MLC is estimated at approximately $85,000 (1997 CDN $). Without increasing patient throughput, this increases the average cost of a course of radiotherapy by approximately CDN $200. Savings can be accrued by decreasing mold room activity, increasing the hourly patient capacity on each treatment machine, and decreasing sick time due to strain injuries.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although the clinical outcome of techniques facilitated by MLCs, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, are unknown at this time, an economic context within which to objectively evaluate this technology is presented. The framework presented suggests a method of quantifying outcome-justified expenditures, such as improved patient outcome and greater treatment flexibility, which, when offset against the incremental annual equipment cost, may be used to help justify the acquisition of multileaf technology.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462300161203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10815368/,economics

A model of a competitive health insurance market is developed; with the risk equalization scheme being imperfect. There are two types of individuals who are characterized by different costs with respect to traditional insurance. Compared with a situation where traditional insurance is compulsory, allowing choice can make both types better off, can increase the utility of low-cost types at the expense of high-cost types, as well as having no effect. Inefficiencies under compulsory traditional insurance can be eliminated and new inefficiencies can be created.

"Michael Birnbaum interviews Bruce C. Vladeck about the landscape for national health reform in 2009. Vladeck, who worked under President Clinton directing Medicare and Medicaid as administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, discusses some of the challenges and opportunities facing the Obama administration. By comparing the current political and economic environments with those he faced while working in the Clinton administration, Vladeck argues that this time around America might be ready for pragmatic reforms leading toward universal coverage. He explores the future of employer-based coverage; problems and solutions for America's aging workforce; poor customer service in Medicare; the ""Medicaid Stigma""; the promise of immigration; and the trade-offs between access, quality, and cost in the American system.

"A standard practice in health economic evaluation is to monetize health effects by assuming a certain societal willingness-to-pay per unit of health gain. Although the resulting net monetary benefit (NMB) is easy to compute, the use of a single willingness-to-pay threshold assumes expressibility of the health effects on a single non-monetary scale. To relax this assumption, this article proves that the NMB framework is a special case of the more general stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) method. Specifically, as SMAA does not restrict the number of criteria to two and also does not require the marginal rates of substitution to be constant, there are problem instances for which the use of this more general method may result in a better understanding of the trade-offs underlying the reimbursement decision-making problem. This is illustrated by applying both methods in a case study related to infertility treatment.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-013-0517-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23843123/,economics
"Competition policy has played a very limited role for health care provision in Norway. The main reason is that Norway has a National Health Service (NHS) with extensive public provision and a wide set of sector-specific regulations that limit the scope for competition. However, the last two decades, several reforms have deregulated health care provision and opened up for provider competition along some dimensions. For specialised care, the government has introduced patient choice and (partly) activity (DRG) based funding, but also corporatised public hospitals and allowed for more private provision. For primary care, a reform changed the payment scheme to capitation and (a higher share of) fee-for-service, inducing almost all GPs on fixed salary contracts to become self-employed. While these reforms have the potential for generating competition in the Norwegian NHS, the empirical evidence is quite limited and the findings are mixed. We identify a set of possible caveats that may weaken the incentives for provider competition - such as the partial implementation of DRG pricing, the dual purchaser-provider role of regional health authorities, and the extensive consolidation of public hospitals - and argue that there is great scope for competition policy measures that could stimulate provider competition within the Norwegian NHS.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.11.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27916434/,economics

"This paper examines effects of the German social health insurance system's reference drug program (RDP) for prescription drugs on ex-factory prices. Moreover, we analyze whether manufacturers adapt prices of their products that are not subject to reference pricing as a consequence of changes in reference prices of their products that are subject to reference pricing. We use econometric panel data methods based on a large panel data set of nearly all German prescription drugs on a monthly basis between October 1994 and July 2005. They provide information on ex-factory prices, reference prices, manufacturers, type of prescription drug, and market entries and exits. Our results show that there is no full price adjustment: A 1%-change in reference prices leads to a 0.3%-change in market prices. Price adjustment, however, is fast - it mostly happens in the first month. Furthermore, the first introduction of a reference price reduces market prices of the affected products by approximately 7%. Finally, we observe a significant time effect that is positive in the market without reference prices and negative in the market with reference prices.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1376,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18677725/,economics
"Limited use conditions (LUCs) are a method of directing treatment with new drugs to those populations where they will be most cost effective. In this paper we investigate how a drug manufacturer could determine pricing and LUCs to maximize profits. We assume that the payer makes formulary decisions on the basis of net monetary benefits, that the disease can be modeled using a Markov model of disease progression, and that the drug reduces the probability of progression between states of the Markov model. LUCs are expressed as a range of probabilities of disease progression over which patients would have access to the new drug. We assume that the manufacturer determines the price and LUCs in order to maximize profits. We show that an explicit trade-off exists between the drug's price and the use conditions, that there is an upper bound on the drug price, that the proportion of the population targeted by the LUC does not depend on quality of life or costs in each health state or the payer's willingness to pay, and that high drug prices do not always correspond with high profits.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1332,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18186544/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      A response to the challenge of high-cost treatments in health care has been economic evaluation. Cost-effectiveness analysis presented as cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained has been controversial, raising heated support and opposition.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the impact of economic evaluation in decisions on what to fund in four European countries and discuss the implications of our findings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a protocol to review the key features of the application of economic evaluation in reimbursement decision making in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, reporting country-specific highlights.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Although the institutions and processes vary by country, health economic evaluation has had limited impact on restricting access of controversial high-cost drugs. Even in those countries that have gone the furthest, ways have been found to avoid refusing to fund high-cost drugs for particular diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and orphan diseases. Economic evaluation may, however, have helped some countries to negotiate price reductions for some drugs. It has also extended to the discussion of clinical effectiveness to include cost.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The differences in approaches but similarities in outcomes suggest that health economic evaluation be viewed largely as rhetoric (in D.N. McCloskey's terms in The Rhetoric of Economics, 1985). This is not to imply that economics had no impact: rather that it usually contributed to the discourse in ways that differed by country. The reasons for this no doubt vary by perspective, from political science to ethics. Economic evaluation may have less to do with rationing or denial of medical treatments than to do with expanding the discourse used to discuss such issues.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.08.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27987645/,economics

"Thailand's universal coverage health care policy has been presented as a knowledge-based reform involving substantial pre-planning, including expert economic analysis of the financing mechanism. This paper describes the new financing system introduced from 2001 in which the Ministry of Public Health allocated monies to local Contracted Units for Primary Care (CUPs) on the basis of population. It discusses the policy intention to use capitation funding to change incentive structures and engineer a transfer of professional staff from over-served urban areas to under-served rural areas. The paper utilises qualitative data from national policy makers and health service staff in three north-eastern provinces to tell the story of the reforms. We found that over time government moved away from the original capitation funding model as the result of (a) a macro-allocation problem arising from system disturbance and professional opposition, and (b) a micro-allocation problem that emerged when local budgets were not shared equitably. In many CUPs, the hospital directors controlling resource allocation channelled funds more towards curative services than community facilities. Taken together the macro and micro problems led to the dilution of capitation funding and reduced the re-distributive effects of the reforms. This strand of policy foundered in the face of structural and institutional barriers to change.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.10.031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19914757/,economics

Previous reports recommended that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocate funding proportional to the burden-of-illness from diseases and conditions. But the most recent publicly available data on burden-of-illness and NIH funding show that infectious diseases are still overfunded relative to their health burden on the American population, especially HIV/AIDS. By contrast, several lifestyle/environmental health conditions are still underfunded, including importantly: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, depression, violence, and road injury. NIH's allocation of research funding is often disproportionate to the current health needs of the American people.

"Objective:
        
      
      To analyse the impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on household out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses, catastrophic health payments and medical impoverishment in Mongolia, a middle-income country with a high population health insurance coverage rate.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Secondary data analysis of the Mongolian Household Socioeconomic Survey with 12 840 households, including information on standard of living, OOP spending, and health conditions of household members. Measures of catastrophic spending and medical impoverishment were constructed for Mongolia. The association of medical impoverishment and catastrophic spending with a range of socioeconomic and demographic covariates and health conditions was assessed using multiple regression models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      OOP health spending contributed to an 8% increase in the incidence of poverty in Mongolia. The impoverishment associated with medical expenses is concentrated in the poorer quintiles, indicating some deepening of poverty among the already poor. Households with a member affected by NCDs and with multiple morbidities were more likely to experience catastrophic spending and medical impoverishment than those with infectious diseases. The main drivers of the financial distress were expenditures incurred for outpatient services, including for diagnostics and drugs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Despite high rates of population health insurance coverage, health expenditures have substantial impoverishing effects in Mongolia, with the impacts being greater among households containing individuals with chronic conditions.

"For the past two decades there has been a debate over the implementation of structural adjustment policies in the health sector of developing countries, much of it focusing on the political and economic relevance of the reform process for public health provision. However, very few studies have been able to assess the relevance of the private sector, which has had a central role in the restructuring of health services worldwide. Lebanon provides just such a case, with a predominantly private provider and the role of the state relegated to financing, with few controls over supply. This situation has ensured the systematic destruction of what remained of public provision in the 1970s. The country is now faced with one of the most expensive health services in the world, and one in which much of the population continues to live under conditions of considerable economic deprivation. The unique situation of Lebanon is maintained by its politics of confessionalism, with sociopolitical relations dominated by primordial ties of family, tribe, and kin, which does not seem to be an obstacle to the process of globalization. The authors suggest that this context reinforces the gross inequalities in access to health care; they explore the complex relationship between state, finance capital, and confessional politics in the context of health sector reform, in particular the financing of health care.",https://doi.org/10.2190/6x2v-ge4t-9bqf-wyxb,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15346684/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      In the early 1990s the Finnish economy suffered a severe recession at the same time as health care reforms were taking place. This study examines the effects of these changes on the distribution of contributions to health care financing in relation to household income. Explanations for changes in various indicators of health care expenditure and use during that time are offered.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The analysis is based partly on actual income data and partly on simulated data from the base year (1990). It employs methods that allow the estimation of confidence intervals for inequality indices (the Gini coefficient and Kakwani's progressivity index).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In spite of the substantial decrease in real incomes during the recession, the distribution of income remained almost unaltered. The share of total health care funding derived from poorer households increased somewhat, due purely to structural changes. The financial plight of the public sector led to the share of total funding from progressive income taxes to decrease, while regressive indirect taxes and direct payments by households contributed more.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It seems that, aside from an increased financing burden on poorer households, Finland's health care system has withstood the tremendous changes of the early 1990s fairly well. This is largely attributable to the features of the tax-financed health care system, which apportions the effects of financial and functional disturbances equitably.",https://doi.org/10.1177/135581969800300107,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10180386/,economics
"The economics models of reputation and quality in markets can be classified in three categories. (i) Pure hidden action, where only one type of seller is present who can provide goods of different quality. (ii) Pure hidden information, where sellers of different types have no control over product quality. (iii) Mixed frameworks, which include both hidden action and hidden information. In this paper we develop a pure hidden action model of reputation and Bertrand competition, where consumers and firms interact repeatedly in a market with free entry. The price of the good produced by the firms is contractible, whilst the quality is noncontractible, hence it is promised by the firms when a contract is signed. Consumers infer future quality from all available information, i.e., both from what they know about past quality and from current prices. According to early contributions, competition should make reputation unable to induce the production of high-quality goods. We provide a simple solution to this problem by showing that high quality levels are sustained as an outcome of a stationary symmetric equilibrium.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110233,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25329387/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      Our prior study found that pharmaceutical-sponsored and non-profit sponsored analyses differed in their published assessments of the economic value of six new oncology drugs. In this study, we expand on our earlier findings and evaluate the association between funding source and 1) characteristics of the published study report and 2) journal type for dissemination of the previously evaluated economic studies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed the published cost-effectiveness literature for hematopoietic colony stimulating factors, 5-HT3 antagonist antiemetics. and taxanes. Two blinded investigators rated specific aspects of study reporting based on the US Public Health Service Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine criteria. Dissemination strategies were evaluated using impact factor scores from the Science Citation Index.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The operational aspects of pharmaceutical-sponsored study reporting were better overall than those associated with non-profit sponsored studies. Specifically, pharmaceutical-sponsored studies were more likely to be reported based on data obtained from randomized clinical trials or detailed cost-models (90% vs. 70%), to include descriptions of the source of cost differences (90% vs. 79%), to state whether the study was carried out from a societal, governmental, or insurer perspective (70% vs. 42%), and to clearly indicate the time-period over which costs were evaluated (65% vs. 50%). Nonprofit sponsored studies were more likely than pharmaceutical sponsored studies to report the generalizability of the findings, including being more likely to include information about how the data could be extrapolated to other clinical settings (58% vs. 35%), to include statements on the statistical significance of the findings (38% vs. 20%), and to clearly outline the cost per unit and data sources for the cost analyses (67% vs. 45%). A similar percent of pharmaceutical and non-profit sponsored studies reported background and conclusions with about 80% providing literature comparisons of the results (about 80%) and two thirds to three fourths discussing the limitations of the finding (75% for pharmaceutical-sponsored and 67% for non-profit sponsored studies). Most studies were published in low impact factor peer-reviewed journals, and journal impact factor scores were similar between pharmaceutical and nonprofit sponsored studies.

      Upon reviewing the entire pharmacoeconomic literature for six new oncology drugs, we identified differences in study reporting, but not in types of journals where studies were published, between pharmaceutical-sponsored and non-profit sponsored studies.

"This paper reviews evidence on social and economic costs of tuberculosis. Key socio-economic consequences include stigma, social isolation, increased out-of-pocket expenditures for medical and non-medical costs and reduced income. Many of the financing methods that households use have long-term negative impacts and the poor are most vulnerable to these costs. Together, these negative consequences adversely affect TB control, in terms of delayed diagnosis, delayed initiation of treatment, suboptimal adherence and failure to complete treatment, as well as the coping and well being of the individual and household. There are two ways to reduce treatment costs for the patient; one can either reduce the direct and indirect costs of seeking a diagnosis and obtaining treatment and/or provide income transfers to offset some of those costs incurred. Social transfers in the form of food, cash or vouchers can mitigate the negative effects by enabling the individual to seek a diagnosis, protecting minimum food expenditures, reducing the need to accumulate debt and reduce productive assets and reducing the negative impacts on other household members, particularly young children and school-age children.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-014-0732-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24710958/,economics
"In the late 1980s, governments in many western economies began to introduce competition between public agencies providing health, education, and other forms of social welfare. Government became a contracting agency separating funding from provision. The United Kingdom went farthest in legislation passed between 1988 and 1990. The authors review some possible explanations for this fundamental change. The article draws on public choice theory and broader political science approaches and reviews the evidence on the impact of the changes. The gains from these changes may be small, and the result may be only the build up of pressure for more spending in the longer term.",https://doi.org/10.2190/ggf3-jq88-y5aa-a35d,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7622314/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the overall economic burden of pneumonia from an employer perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The annual, per capita cost of pneumonia was determined for beneficiaries of a major employer by analyzing medical, pharmaceutical, and disability claims data. The incremental costs of 4036 patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia identified in a health claims database of a national Fortune 100 company were compared with a 10% random sample of beneficiaries in the employer overall population.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Total annual, per capita, employer costs were approximately 5 times higher for patients with pneumonia ($11 544) than among typical beneficiaries in the employer overall population ($2368). The increases in costs were for all components (eg, medical care, prescription drug, disability, and particularly for inpatient services). A small proportion (10%) of pneumonia patients (almost all of whom were hospitalized) accounted for most (59%) of the costs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with pneumonia present an important financial burden to employers. These patients use more medical care services, particularly inpatient services, than the average beneficiary in the employer overall population. In addition to direct health care costs related to medical utilization and the use of prescription drugs, indirect costs due to disability and absenteeism also contribute to the high cost of pneumonia to an employer.",https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.161.22.2725,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11732939/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      As part of the German healthcare modernization law implemented in 2004, infertile couples face a 50% co-payment of the total assisted reproduction technique (ART) treatment costs. This has led to a drastic reduction in ART treatment cycle numbers after January 2004. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the number of ART treatment cycles in different German federal states changed differentially after implementation of the law, depending on the economical power of the individual state in terms of gross domestic product per capita (GDP pc).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective data exploratory study. Data from the German IVF registry and the German Federal Statistics Office were utilized. Main outcome parameter was the proportional difference of ART treatment numbers between the time periods 2002-2003 and 2004-2005 stratified for the 16 German federal states. The federal states were grouped by Tukey-Hinges percentile analysis of GDP pc.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The reduction of ART treatment cycle number was strongest in the lowest GDP pc group of federal states (Kruskal-Wallis P = 0.038). Mean reduction in ART cycle numbers was 51.5%, 35.7% and 38.8% in the 0-25th, 25-75th and 75-100th GDP pc percentile group, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:

"It is becoming widely accepted that research which considers only the outcome and not the costs associated with new technologies in health care, is of limited value in making decisions about the use of scarce resources. Economic evaluation is becoming a standard feature of clinical research but many published economic evaluations fall short of best practice in their methodology. We have described the essential features of economic evaluation, using published studies in orthopaedics, in order to try to improve the ability of orthopaedic surgeons to read, understand and appraise such studies critically, and to encourage them to consider including economic evaluation in future investigations.",https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620x.82b1.9575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10697306/,economics
"The introduction of new (and expensive) pharmaceutical products is one of the major challenges for health systems. The search for new institutional arrangements is natural. The use of the so-called risk-sharing agreements is one example. Recent discussions have somewhat neglected the economic fundamentals underlying risk-sharing agreements. We argue here that risk-sharing agreements, although attractive due to the principle of paying by results, also entail risks. Too many patients may be put under treatment. Prices are likely to be adjusted upward, in anticipation of future risk-sharing agreements between the pharmaceutical company and the third-party payer. An available instrument is a verification cost per patient treated, which allows obtaining the first-best allocation of patients to the new treatment, under the agreement. Overall, the welfare effects of risk-sharing agreements are ambiguous, and caution is urged regarding their use.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21394816/,economics
"This paper considers the risk of incurring future medical expenditures in light of a family's resources available to pay for those expenditures as well as their choice of health insurance. We model non-premium medical out-of-pocket expenditures and use the estimates from our model to develop a prospective measure of medical care economic risk estimating the proportion of families who are at risk of incurring high non-premium out-of-pocket medical care expenses in relation to its resources. We further use the estimates from our model to compare the extent to which different types of insurance mitigate the risk of incurring non-premium expenditures by providing for increased utilization of medical care. We find that while 21.3% of families lack the resources to pay for the median expenditures for their insurance type, 42.4% lack the resources to pay for the 99th percentile of expenditures for their insurance type. We also find the mediating effect of insurance on non-premium expenditures to outweigh the associated premium expense for expenditures above $1804 for employer-sponsored insurance and $4337 for direct purchase insurance for those younger than age 65; and above $12 118 of expenditures for Medicare supplementary plans for those aged 65 or older.

"This paper analyzes the welfare economics of three arrangements for purchasing health insurance: competitive markets in which consumers are free to choose among options with different levels of coverage and prices; systems with compulsory partial pooling which permit private firms to sell supplementary coverage; and government-run pools that purchase comprehensive coverage at a single price for all consumers. Competitive insurance markets are assumed to face the problem of 'adverse selection'. This refers to a situation in which the insurer cannot observe characteristics of individuals that affect the cost of insurance and that are known to the individuals. Competitive markets with adverse selection are not efficient because low risks cannot purchase comprehensive insurance coverage. However, government-run pools with comprehensive coverage are an inefficient solution to the problem of adverse selection. Compulsory partial coverage may represent an attractive alternative to both competitive markets and comprehensive pools. We discover two situations when government intervention of this type will succeed: when there are not many high risks in the population, and when the risk types are similar. We discuss the implications of these results for health insurance programs in several countries. Our results also have implications for the allocation of public funds for disease-prevention projects. A project targeted at high risks will produce external benefits for low risks, even though they are not directly affected by the program. However, a successful project might eliminate the market for private insurance; in this case the government should consider mandating partial insurance coverage.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199812)7:8<659::aid-hec384>3.0.co;2-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9890328/,economics

The attempt to selectively reduce public spending is examined with reference to its objective impact on men and women using official statistics and specialist reports. In addition, on the basis of a large-scale interview survey the subjective impact of and political reactions to the cuts are analysed by gender. The main findings are that this current social policy negatively affects women as both public sector workers and consumers more than men. Political reactions to the cuts were extensive but unrelated to gender per se. However, when one controls for economic activity and related variables, gender differences in terms of both political attitudes and behaviour were insignificant compared to the contrast between the economically active and inactive.

In recent years, this has changed as health plans have begun to adopt evidence-based and value-based formulary submission guidelines. The guidelines have the potential to serve as a national unifying template for pharmacy and therapeutics committees to consider clinical and economic information in a systematic and rigorous fashion.

"The best opportunity to pursue cost containment in the next five to ten years is through reforming provider payment to gradually diminish the role of fee-for-service reimbursement. Public and private payers have launched many promising payment reform pilots aimed at blending fee-for-service with payment approaches based on broader units of care, such as an episode or patients' total needs over a period of time, a crucial first step. But meaningful cost containment from payment reform will not be achieved until Medicare and Medicaid establish stronger incentives for providers to contract in this way, with discouragement of nonparticipation increasing over time. In addition, the models need to evolve to engage beneficiaries, perhaps through incentives for patients to enroll in an accountable care organization and to seek care within that organization's network of providers.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650327/,economics
"Climatic and other extreme events threaten the globalized economy, which relies on increasingly complex and specialized supply-chain networks. Disasters generate (i) direct economic losses due to reduced production in the locations where they occur, and (ii) to indirect losses from the supply shortages and demand changes that cascade along the supply chains. Firms can use inventories to reduce their risk of shortages. Since firms are interconnected through the supply chain, the level of inventory hold by one firm influences the risk of shortages of the others. Such interdependencies lead to systemic risks in supply chain networks. We introduce a stylized model of complex supply-chain networks in which firms adjust their inventory to maximize profit. We analyze the resulting risks and inventory patterns using evolutionary game theory. We report the following findings. Inventories significantly reduce disruption cascades and indirect losses at the expense of a moderate increase in direct losses. The more fragmented a supply chain is, the less beneficial it is for individual firms to maintain inventories, resulting in higher systemic risks. One way to mitigate such systemic risks is to prescribe inventory sizes to individual firms-a measure that could, for instance, be fostered by insurers. We found that prescribing firm-specific inventory sizes based on their position in the supply chain mitigates systemic risk more effectively than setting the same inventory requirements for all firms.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33370350/,economics
"Aim:
        
      
      To descriptively analyze the policy environment surrounding the Polish generic medicines retail market.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The policy analysis was based on an international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting generic for originator medicines in Poland using IMS Health pharmaceutical intelligence data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Poland has a mature, high-volume, low-value generic medicines market, primarily driven by the establishment of the reference price at the price of the cheapest medicine in combination with pricing regulation and the low level of medicine prices. The practice of discounting in the distribution chain implies that the National Health Fund and patients do not capture the potential savings from a generic medicines market where companies compete on price. This high-volume market has benefited in the past from the limited availability of originator medicines and a short data exclusivity period, even though there are no incentives for physicians to prescribe generic medicines and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense generic medicines. Increased generic substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on originator medicines by 21%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To develop a competitive and sustainable market, Poland needs to consider moving away from competition by discount to competition by price. This could be achieved by replacing maximum distribution margins by fixed margins. Also, Poland may wish to raise reference prices as a temporary measure to boost market entry for medicine classes with few generic medicines.",https://doi.org/10.3325/cmj.2009.50.440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19839067/,economics
"Health technology assessment already informed Dutch policymaking in the early 1980s. Evidence of health economic evaluations is, however, only systematically used in drug reimbursement decision making. Outpatient drugs with an added therapeutic value and expensive specialist drugs require evidence from an economic evaluation. Due to many exemptions, however, the availability of evidence of health economic evaluations remains rather low. Although the Dutch reimbursement agency suggested a cost-effectiveness threshold range depending on the severity of the disease (i.e., €10,000 - 80,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), it was never confirmed nor endorsed by the Ministry of Health. It is highly questionable whether health economic evaluations currently play a role in actual Dutch reimbursement decision making. Although the requirements exist in policy procedures, recent cases show that Dutch policymakers experience great difficulties in putting restrictions on reimbursement based on evidence from health economic evaluations. The near future will show whether the need will increase to base decisions on societal value for money, and whether Dutch policymakers show the courage to take health economic evaluations seriously.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2014.06.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444296/,economics
"Background/aim:
        
      
      Cardiovascular disease imposes a burden to society in terms of mortality, morbidity and economic losses. The aim of this study was to estimate the economic burden of cardiovascular disease in Serbia in 2009 from the perspective of the society.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For the purpose of the study cardiovascular disease was defined by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, as the following diagnosis: hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure and cerebrovascular disease. The prevalence, top-down method was used to quantify the annual cardiovascular costs. Productivity losses were estimated using the human capital approach and the friction cost method. A discount rate of 5% was used to convert all future lifetime earnings into the present value.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total direct costs of cardiovascular disease in 2009 were Euro 400 million. The results showed that more than half a million working days were lost due to incapacity resulting from cardiovascular diseases, yielding the Euro 113.9 millon. The majority of total costs (Euro 514.3 million) were for: medication (29.94%), hospital days (28.97%) and hospital inpatient care--surgical and diagnostic interventions (17.84%). The results were robust to a change in 20% of volume or the unit price of all direct and indirect cost and to discount rate 2% and 10%. CONCLUSIONS; The total cardiovascular disease costs in 2009 represented approximately 1.8% of the Serbian gross domestic product. The results of the study would be valuable to health policy makers to bridge the gap between invested resources and needs, in order to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.2298/vsp1402137l,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24665570/,economics
"Transparency in health economic decision modelling is important for engendering confidence in the models and in the reliability of model-based cost-effectiveness analyses. The Mount Hood Diabetes Challenge Network has taken a lead in promoting transparency through validation with biennial conferences in which diabetes modelling groups meet to compare simulated outcomes of pre-specified scenarios often based on the results of pivotal clinical trials. Model registration is a potential method for promoting transparency, while also reducing the duplication of effort. An important network initiative is the ongoing construction of a diabetes model registry (https://www.mthooddiabeteschallenge.com). Following the 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the Society of Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) guidelines, we recommend that modelling groups provide technical and non-technical documentation sufficient to enable model reproduction, but not necessarily provide the model code. We also request that modelling groups upload documentation on the methods and outcomes of validation efforts, and run reference case simulations so that model outcomes can be compared. In this paper, we discuss conflicting definitions of transparency in health economic modelling, and describe the ongoing development of a registry of economic models for diabetes through the Mount Hood Diabetes Challenge Network, its objectives and potential further developments, and highlight the challenges in its construction and maintenance. The support of key stakeholders such as decision-making bodies and journals is key to ensuring the success of this and other registries. In the absence of public funding, the development of a network of modellers is of huge value in enhancing transparency, whether through registries or other means.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00825-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31347104/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Antimicrobial agents constitute one of the most utilized groups of drugs in daily clinical practice and, therefore they involve a significant expense. The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic cost of the antimicrobials prescribed in a rural area as well as to search for some cheaper alternatives.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective study. The economic cost of antimicrobial agents prescribed at a health centre over 18 months was studied. To do this, clinical histories of 800 people were reviewed. Afterwards, a minimized analysis of costs was carried out.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total cost of antimicrobial consumption came to 2,080.752 pts. The average expenditure per patient came to 6,433.85 +/- 14 269.29 pts. Significant differences between the sexes were not found; however, the expenditure in patients of 65 years of age or over was significantly higher than the rest. After applying the ABC analysis it was noticed that macrolides, cephalosporins, antimicrobial combinations and quinolones were the most important groups from an economic point of view. The use of monodose containers would allow us to save up to 7.83% of the total expenditure. In addition, by prescribing the cheapest marketed pharmaceutical product we could save a further 6.54%, and, finally, by combining these two measures the total possible saving would reach 299,052 pts, a 14.37% of the total expenditure.

"Optimal stockpiling is the best possible strategy to overcome the problem of peak oil periods of oil producer economies.

Measured the optimized scales of SPR through using oil price model, global oil market, and depletion effects of oil production classification. The peak oil period occurs from the interection between the geological era, proficiency in a practical skill, economy of consumers, and geopolitics, and the quality of deciding of demand and supply in which we have done a general dynamic balance model. Results reveal that peak oil time periods may lead towards diverse oil prices time profiles, economic development, and commodity flows. Interestingly, the macroeconomic effects of peak oil and the trajectories in objective function of two options maximize the households' welfare and oil revenues and its effect on growth trajectories of oil-consuming countries. If an oil supply disruption happens, the rate of oil acquisition will be considerably decreased, though it may not be a good strategy to interrupt the activities of oil reserve with the aim of minimizing the overall costs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08419-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32212080/,economics
"Social health insurance (SHI) is enjoying something of a revival in parts of the developing world. Many countries that have in the past relied largely on tax finance (and out-of-pocket payments) have introduced SHI, or are thinking about doing so. And countries with SHI already in place are making vigorous efforts to extend coverage to the informal sector. Ironically, this revival is occurring at a time when the traditional SHI countries in Europe have either already reduced payroll financing in favor of general revenues, or are in the process of doing so. This paper examines how SHI fares in health-care delivery, revenue collection, covering the formal sector, and its impacts on the labor market. It argues that SHI does not necessarily deliver good quality care at a low cost, partly because of poor regulation of SHI purchasers. It suggests that the costs of collecting revenues can be substantial, even in the formal sector where non-enrollment and evasion are commonplace, and that while SHI can cover the formal sector and the poor relatively easily, it fares badly in terms of covering the non-poor informal sector workers until the economy has reached a high level of economic development.

"The objective of this paper is to provide a framework for evaluation of changes in health policy against overarching health system goals. We propose a categorisation of policies into seven distinct health system domains. We then develop existing analytical concepts of insurance coverage and cost-effectiveness further to evaluate the effects of policies in each domain on equity and efficiency. The framework is illustrated with likely effects of policy changes implemented in a sample of European countries since 2008. Our illustrative analysis suggests that cost containment has been the main focus and that countries have implemented a mix of measures that are efficient or efficiency neutral. Similarly, policies are likely to have mixed effects on equity. Additional user charges were a common theme but these were frequently accompanied by additional exemptions, making their likely effects on equity difficult to evaluate. We provide a framework for future, and more detailed, evaluations of changes in health policy.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2017.07.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28803706/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Due to increased utilization of biospecimens for research and emergence of new technologies, the availability and quality of biospecimens and their collection are coming more and more into focus. However, the long-term economic situation of biobanks is still mostly unclear. Also, the common sustainable utilization of various international biobanks is challenging due to local differences in sample processing, law and ethics.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      This article discusses possible strategies to achieve a sustainable utilization of biospecimens as part of the business plan of biobanks.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The following questions were addressed as part of a business plan: (1) How can a biobank build up and maintain an up-to-date infrastructure? (2) What kind of funding can support the sustainability of a biobank? (3) Is there an international solution for informed consents to enable sample and data sharing? (4) How can a biobank react during economically unstable periods? (5) Which kind of biobanking research is innovative? (6) What kind of education could be most needful for knowledge transfer in biobanking? (7) Does an expiration date for a biobank make sense according to the period of funding?

"In the late 1980s, it became clear that poor outcomes of the Russian health system were caused not only by underfunding but also by inadequate management of health care. Some features of the system led to great inefficiency in medical care provision and an irrational structure of medical care. The recognition of this fact has intensified the search for new methods of finance and management. The underlying idea of health care reforms in Russia is to weaken providers' dominance, to make them more responsive to consumer preferences, and to change the structure of medical care. The main developments of the reform parallel the reforms in Western countries. These are primarily the separation of finance and provision of medical care, with the shift from an integrated to a contractual model of relationships between payers and providers. But the specific characteristics of the health care situation, primarily the great underfunding and the absolute dominance of state-owned medical facilities, make the reform in the Russian health sector more radical. This paper highlights the issues of the current and planned developments in the Russian health sector. After presenting the main characteristics of the current health systems, it addresses economic experiments which are underway in several regions of the new Russian Federation. They are designed to introduce elements of market relations into a highly bureaucratic system. The main features and the impact of the experiments are discussed. Then the new model of finance, which is based on a transition from tax-financed to the health insurance system, is presented.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.4740090105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10137132/,economics

      This study was conducted to determine the scale and the nature of the economic burden caused by strokes and to use the results as an evidential source for determining the allocation of South Korea stroke cases in 2015.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For research subjects, the study analyzed demographic characteristics and economic burden based on data from national health insurance (NHI) claims for inpatient and outpatient cases of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke in 2015 through the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) and statistical data regarding cause of death from the Korea National Statistical Office (KNSO). This study, in order to estimate economic burden due to stroke, deduced the direct and indirect costs of illness caused by stroke, using cost-of-illness (COI) methods. The economic burden is divided into direct and indirect costs, and indirect cost is estimated by summing lost productivity measured in opportunity cost lost by medical disposition due to a specific disease and lost productivity due to premature death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total economic burden in Korea due to stroke was US$6.855 billion, that due to ischemic stroke was US$3.658 billion, and that due to hemorrhagic stroke was US$3.197 billion. The average economic burden per stroke case was about US$7247.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results of estimating the annual economic burden in all of Korea due to stroke will be used as an evidential source for preparing medical insurance policies, priorities, and plans for arranging medical resources for stroke as well as for determining effective prevention of the disease and related priorities in national health care policies.",https://doi.org/10.15171/ijhpm.2018.42,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30316242/,economics
"The impact of technology and the emphasis on tertiary specialty care have no inherent limits of cost escalation. Likewise, they dislocate health care resources since general and secondary care become more expensive as the impact of the high cost emphasis of health care trickles down to the costs of primary and secondary care. The change areas will involve: the principle of regionalization of specialty care and resident training, a uniform system of costs and reimbursements for all specialized medical and hospital care, the rationing of high technology specialty care and the application of prospective systems of payment to all institutional and physician specialty services.",https://doi.org/10.1300/j045v04n01_02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10125171/,economics
"Attention and assistance to enhance the role of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) by the government is more emphasized due to the success of SMEs in earning significant amount of foreign currency when Indonesia had to face economical crisis in 1997. This policy has been highly recognized again since the bombing tragedy in 2002; with the excellent evidence to show how important SMEs is in helping and maintaining the economic development of Bali. But in the implementation the assistance needs to be remanaged again in a more proper and appropriate way to attain the ultimate goals. The three economic potentials, agriculture in broad sense, tourism and SMEs (cottage industry included), must be developed in harmony, interdependence, support and complementary each other, if possible as synergist to obtain sustainable development of Bali. While assistance to SMEs must be done in a more coordinated way among the government technical offices, universities, NGOs, banking, and other social community institutions. By doing so, there would be no duplication or gap, nor creation of new disadvantageous problems. It could be in form of ergonomics, occupational health and safety impacts and problems in particular, and in adverse working conditions and environment in general. Therefore it is a must at this moment to carry out total approach in helping SMEs, by integrating the effort to improve their working conditions and environment, built-in within the effort to enhance SMEs'quality of life through economic assistance. In this process a total approach through SHIP approach and Appropriate Technology intervention must be done wisely and timely. By so doing, SMEs'sustainable working conditions and environment shall be attained.",https://doi.org/10.2486/indhealth.44.22,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16610528/,economics
"Modern hospitals are complex multi-product organisations. The analysis of a hospital's production and/or cost structure should therefore use the appropriate techniques. Flexible functional forms based on the neo-classical theory of the firm seem to be most suitable. Using neo-classical cost functions implicitly assumes minimisation of (variable) costs given that input prices and outputs are exogenous. Local and global properties of flexible functional forms and short-run versus long-run equilibrium are further issues that require thorough investigation. In order to put the results based on econometric estimations of cost functions in the right perspective, it is important to keep these considerations in mind when using flexible functional forms. The more recent studies seem to agree that hospitals generally do not operate in their long-run equilibrium (they tend to over-invest in capital (capacity and equipment)) and that it is therefore appropriate to estimate a short-run variable cost function. However, few studies explicitly take into account the implicit assumptions and restrictions embedded in the models they use. An alternative method to explain differences in costs uses management accounting techniques to identify the cost drivers of overhead costs. Related issues such as cost-shifting and cost-adjusting behaviour of hospitals and the influence of market structure on competition, prices and costs are also discussed shortly.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00237-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12220092/,economics

"The process of costing clinical biochemistry tests as a component of the commissioning of a unit management budgeting system based on an International Computers Limited (ICL) minicomputer system was examined. Methods of apportioning consumable and labour costs under direct and indirect cost headings and as test and request charges were investigated, and in this currently operational system it was found that 38% of consumable costs and 57% of labour costs were not a direct component of the routine analysis function. Means of assigning test costs to a given request source and the incorporation of such charges into clinical budget statements were looked at. A reduction in laboratory workload did not produce a comparable reduction in laboratory costs. For a theoretical reduction in workload of 20% only a 3.8% laboratory saving in recoverable costs could be expected.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jcp.39.8.817,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3745472/,economics
"Environmental pollution, rapid economic growth, and other social factors have adverse effects on public health, which have consequently increased the burden of health expenditures during the last two decades. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the environment index, as well as economic and non-economic factors such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, foreign direct investment, population aging, and secondary education impacts on per capita government and private health expenditures in 13 emerging economies for the time period of 1994-2017. We employ robust econometric techniques in this endeavor of panel data analysis to account for the issues of heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. This study applies the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) bootstrap approach to investigate the presence of panel cointegration and empirical results underscore the existence of cointegration among variables. For the execution of long-run analysis, we incorporate the two latest estimators, i.e., continuously updated-fully modified (CUP-FM) and continuously updated- bias corrected (CUP-BC). Findings of long-run elasticities have documented that the air-pollution indicators, i.e., CO2 emissions and the environment index, have a positive and significant influence on government health expenditures, while in contrast, both factors negatively influence private health expenditures in emerging economies. We find that economic factors such as GDP growth consistently show a positive impact on both government and private health expenditures, whereas, foreign direct investment exhibits a significant negative and positive impact on government and private health expenditures respectively. Findings of non-economic factors can be used to argue that population aging increases health expenditures while secondary education lowers private health spending in emerging markets. Furthermore, empirical analysis of heterogeneous causality indicates that CO2 emissions, the environment index, GDP growth, foreign direct investment, and secondary education have a unidirectional causal relationship with government and private health expenditures. Population aging has a strong relationship of bidirectional causality with government health expenditures and unidirectional causal relationship with private health expenditures. Findings of this paper put forward key suggestions for policy makers which can be used as valuable instruments for better understanding and aiming to maximize public healthcare and environmental quality gains which are highly connected with sustainable GDP growth and developments in emerging economies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16111967,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31163652/,economics
"The study examines the attitudes of general practitioners in Copenhagen to a recent change in their remuneration system from capitation to a mixed capitation and fee-for-service system. The study was based on two questionnaires, one before and one 18 months after the change, distributed to a primarily self-selected sample of 100 general practioners in Copenhagen City. The questionnaires provided information about certain basic characteristics of the respondents, attitudes to the new remuneration system as compared with the former, and possible changes in attitudes towards professional competence and responsibilities in secondary versus primary care. The majority of the respondents did not feel any changes under the new remuneration system in terms of diagnostic and curative possibilities and their relations to colleagues and patients. Attitudes to secondary versus primary care responsibilities also changed little. The majority felt that there had been an increase in their total work load, but also an improved economic situation in their practice. 21% felt that there was more competition with colleagues and 30% that doctor-patient relationships had suffered as a result of the introduction of a fee-for-service.",https://doi.org/10.3109/02813439109026589,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1891662/,economics
"Anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 26.9 million individuals in the United States at some point during their lives. This study used the human capital approach to estimate the direct and indirect costs of these highly prevalent disorders. In 1990, costs associated with anxiety disorders were $46.6 billion, 31.5% of total expenditures for mental illness. Less than one-quarter of costs associated with anxiety disorders were for direct medical treatment; over three-quarters were attributable to lost or reduced productivity. Most of these indirect costs were associated with morbidity, as mortality accounted for just 2.7% of the total. Greater availability of effective, relatively low-cost outpatient treatment could substantially reduce the economic and social burden of these common and often crippling disorders.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1522-7154(1996)2:4<167::aid-anxi2>3.0.co;2-l,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9160618/,economics

"Progress in the treatment of cancers in young people has resulted in an increasing success rate in curing the different forms of malignant diseases. The mission of the CPAC/C(17) Task Force on Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) with cancer is to ensure prompt, equitable access to the best care; establish research priorities to optimize health outcomes and health-related quality of life; and mitigate current disparities of care through advances in treatment, education, and research. Although these goals are important, the mission statement seems to ignore an important factor: ""affordability,"" or the ability to achieve these goals due to scarcity of resources. In this article, the role of economics in helping decision makers decide on resource allocation is discussed. Also described is the economic basis for the healthcare problem; the inability of the current methodology of cost-effectiveness to provide information that can help improve resource allocation in health; and how economics should be used to promote efficient use of healthcare resources. The author argued that ""affordability"" should be recognized in the mission statement. Recognizing ""affordability"" means recognizing the need to justify the transfer (or allocation) of additional resources to AYA cancer, which requires demonstration that the value of what is gained from the use of these resources in AYA cancer exceeds the value of what is forgone by using them elsewhere. This will also require making explicit the values or equity criteria to which society subscribes.",https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.26047,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21523743/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      The choice of the most appropriate approach to valuing productivity loss has received much debate in the literature. The friction cost approach has been proposed as a more appropriate alternative to the human capital approach when valuing productivity loss, although its application remains limited. This study reviews application of the friction cost approach in health economic studies and examines how its use varies in practice across different country settings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was performed to identify economic evaluation studies that have estimated productivity costs using the friction cost approach and published in English from 1996 to 2013. A standard template was developed and used to extract information from studies meeting the inclusion criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search yielded 46 studies from 12 countries. Of these, 28 were from the Netherlands. Thirty-five studies reported the length of friction period used, with only 16 stating explicitly the source of the friction period. Nine studies reported the elasticity correction factor used. The reported friction cost approach methods used to derive productivity costs varied in quality across studies from different countries.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Few health economic studies have estimated productivity costs using the friction cost approach. The estimation and reporting of productivity costs using this method appears to differ in quality by country. The review reveals gaps and lack of clarity in reporting of methods for friction cost evaluation. Generating reporting guidelines and country-specific parameters for the friction cost approach is recommended if increased application and accuracy of the method is to be realized.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-014-0652-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25387561/,economics
"Efforts to limit pharmacy costs raise both ethical and economic considerations. Six values should inform pharmacy benefit management: (1) accepting resource constraints; (2) helping the sick; (3) protecting the worst off; (4) respecting autonomy; (5) sustaining trust; and (6) promoting inclusive decision making. Direct controls, such as formularies, step therapy, and prior authorization, can focus limited resources on the sick and worst off. However, direct controls limit autonomy and are administratively burdensome. Indirect controls, such as physician capitation, tiered copayments, and drug benefit caps, align physicians' and patients' interests with resource constraints, respect autonomy, and are administratively efficient. Unfortunately, they deter use based on cost, not medical need; they do not focus cuts on unnecessary or marginal drug use or focus resources on the sick. Budget caps are the least defensible, while tiered copays and physician capitation can be justified if implemented with safeguards. Formularies and step therapy are ethically justifiable if they can be efficiently instituted.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.20.5.150,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11558699/,economics
"The growth of investor-owned hospital-management companies represents the most dramatic change in the hospital industry in recent years. Whereas supporters of investor-owned chains suggest that their growth is attributable to operating efficiencies, critics suggest that it has resulted from pricing and marketing strategies. Using data supplied by the California Health Facilities Commission, we compared the economic performance of investor-owned and not-for-profit hospitals in California. There were three principal findings. First, during the study period both costs and charges were higher in for-profit than in not-for-profit hospitals, measured on the basis of either patient-days or admissions. Second, the for-profit chains have used aggressive marketing and pricing strategies to generate high rates of profitability and growth. Finally, the payer class of patients did not differ specifically according to the hospital-ownership category. We conclude that the recent dramatic growth of investor-owned hospital chains is attributable to the employment of managerial strategies that were well suited to the reimbursement system in effect during the period studied. As a result of recent changes in federal and state reimbursement, many of these reimbursement-maximization strategies have become obsolete. Whether the investor-owned chains will be able to adapt rapidly to this new reimbursement environment remains to be seen.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198308113090606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6346098/,economics

If DRGs are calculated properly, based on a valid statistical analysis of average length of stay, hospital reimbursement will be ensured in the average of one year. Not cost-effective cases will be compensated with profitable patients. There is no economic need to release or transfer patients from hospital earlier than necessary or tenable.

"Objective:
        
      
      To review and analyze recommendations from national pharmacoeconomic guidelines with regard to acknowledging patient heterogeneity in economic evaluations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      National pharmacoeconomic guidelines were obtained through the ISPOR Web site. Guidance was extracted by using a developed data extraction sheet. Extracted data were divided into subcategories on the basis of consensus meetings.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 26 included guidelines, 20 (77%) advised to identify patient heterogeneity. Most guidelines (77%) provided general methodological advice to acknowledge patient heterogeneity, including justifications for distinguishing subgroups (65%), prespecification of subgroups (42%), or methodology to acknowledge patient heterogeneity (77%). Stratified analysis of cost-effectiveness was most commonly advised (20 guidelines; 77%); however, guidance on the specific application of methods was scarce (9 guidelines; 34%) and generally limited if provided. Guidance to present patient heterogeneity was provided by 15 guidelines (58%), most prominently to describe the definition (31%) and justification (31%) of subgroups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The majority of national pharmacoeconomic guidelines provide guidance on acknowledging patient heterogeneity in economic evaluations. However, because guidance is mostly not specific, its usefulness is limited. This may reflect that the importance of acknowledging patient heterogeneity is usually recognized while there is a lack of consensus on specific methods to acknowledge patient heterogeneity. We advise the further development of national pharmacoeconomic guidelines to provide specific guidance on the identification of patient heterogeneity, methods to acknowledge it, and presenting the results. We present a checklist that can assist in formulating these recommendations. This could facilitate the systematic and transparent handling of patient heterogeneity in economic evaluations worldwide.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23947981/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      This study examined trends in the price of healthy and less-healthy foods from 1989 to 2007 using the Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      CPI food expenditure classes were classified as 'core' or 'non-core'. Trends in the CPI were analysed to examine the rise in prices of core compared with non-core foods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On average, the CPI for core foods has risen at a slightly higher, though not statistically significant, rate than non-core foods. Furthermore, selected groupings reveal interesting patterns. 'Bread' has risen in price significantly more than 'cakes and biscuits', and 'milk' has risen in price significantly more than 'soft drinks, waters and juices'.

"This study uses the Tapio elastic decoupling analysis method and an empirical model of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) to analyze the decoupling between municipal solid waste (MSW) generation and economic development in 285 of China's cities from 2002 to 2017. The decoupling analysis results show that the decoupling states in China's cities generally improved first and then deteriorated in 2002-2017. The proportion of cities experiencing deterioration of decoupling states had increased to 60.00% by 2014-2017, and cities with a higher economic development level generally had more serious deterioration. The empirical test results support the N-shaped EKC hypothesis of MSW, which can explain why the decoupling state changed from improvement to deterioration. The difference of the economic level of sample cities (which determines their position on EKC) can also explain the spatial heterogeneity of the decoupling state and its changes; for example, the proportion of cities that have crossed the inflection point of Tapio decoupling elasticity (the per capita GDP is 13,130.89 yuan) to enter the deterioration stage is highest (100/101) in the economically developed eastern region, and is lowest (66/75) in the economically backward western region of China.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To describe and evaluate the different price control strategies implemented in Norway after its accession to the European Economic Area (1994-2004).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Interviews with ten key persons who had broad insight into the field in question were held. All the available literature was reviewed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Direct price control involving international reference pricing of prescription drugs, and the subsequent price revisions, that occurred from the year 2000 onwards, resulted in predictable and substantial price reductions. With respect to the indirect methods which targeted the off-patent market, the price reductions resulting from reference-based pricing (1993-2000) were only marginal and the achieved savings derived mainly from increased patients' charges. The introduction of generic substitution in 2001 led to increased market shares for non-branded products, but discounts from the manufacturers were not reflected in retail prices. An index price system (2003-2004) was therefore created; but as it entailed negative economical incentives for the pharmacy chains, the price changes did not meet the expectations.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The direct pricing strategy, i.e. the international reference pricing, was considered to be the most successful method.

"This paper focuses on the price elasticity of hospital-specific demand curves. Each hospital is assumed to practice price discrimination with respect to Medicare, Medicaid, and other patients. Among the third group, patients covered by Blue Cross are analyzed separately from those who pay their own bills or are covered by commercial insurance or a health maintenance organization (HMO). We use two different methods to estimate the price elasticity of demand. First, a pricing rule is developed from which hospital-specific price elasticities may be inferred. Second, the distribution of each payer's admissions at specific hospitals is examined to determine if low-priced hospitals attract more patients. Data for the analysis are taken from 31 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in 1981. Results of the first analytic method indicate that hospitals had monopoly power in their markets for Blue Cross and self pay/commercial insurance/HMO patients.

"This study aims to explore whether higher education and science popularization can achieve coordinated growth with temporal and spatial characteristics. Selecting the provincial regions of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China as cases with data from the national statistics administrations (such as China Statistical Yearbook), this study uses entropy weight analysis, TOPSIS, GM(1,1) gray prediction methods and coupling coordination degree model to evaluate the coordinated growth status. The key findings are: (1) the annual budget per student, and the number of science and technology museums affect both systems more obviously; (2) the overall performances of science popularization fluctuate more obviously than those of higher education; (3) the coordinated growth performances of the two systems in most regions remain mild fluctuations and keep relatively stable coordinated status, however, temporal and spatial variation tendencies do exist among regions. Therefore, corresponding countermeasures should be implemented: generally, national authority needs to involve in coordination activities among regions; the regions with satisfactory coordinated growth performances need more creative approaches to maintain the coordinated growth interactions; the regions at the transitioning status need to prevent the grade decline and upgrade the performances; the regions with lagging performances need to stop the decline and reduce the gaps with others. The novelties include analyzing the coordinated growth interaction mechanism between the two, selecting indices to assess the abstract interaction mechanism precisely, proposing suggestions based on temporal and spatial comparisons of the coordinated growth performances, etc.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256612,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34492057/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The economic burden of uncorrected refractive error (URE) is thought to be high in Mozambique, largely as a consequence of the lack of resources and systems to tackle this largely avoidable problem. The Mozambique Eyecare Project (MEP) has established the first optometry training and human resource deployment initiative to address the burden of URE in Lusophone Africa. The nature of the MEP programme provides the opportunity to determine, using Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), whether investing in the establishment and delivery of a comprehensive system for optometry human resource development and public sector deployment is economically justifiable for Lusophone Africa.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A CBA methodology was applied across the period 2009-2049. Costs associated with establishing and operating a school of optometry, and a programme to address uncorrected refractive error, were included. Benefits were calculated using a human capital approach to valuing sight. Disability weightings from the Global Burden of Disease study were applied. Costs were subtracted from benefits to provide the net societal benefit, which was discounted to provide the net present value using a 3% discount rate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Using the most recently published disability weightings, the potential exists, through the correction of URE in 24.3 million potentially economically productive persons, to achieve a net present value societal benefit of up to $1.1 billion by 2049, at a Benefit-Cost ratio of 14:1. When CBA assumptions are varied as part of the sensitivity analysis, the results suggest the societal benefit could lie in the range of $649 million to $9.6 billion by 2049.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrates that a programme designed to address the burden of refractive error in Mozambique is economically justifiable in terms of the increased productivity that would result due to its implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-14-422,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25246105/,economics
"This report describes the decline in employer-based health coverage between 1989 and 1996 and the underlying causes of that decline--including rapidly rising worker premiums and other economic variables. The analysis combines data from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, the National Medical Expenditures Survey for workers with employer coverage, and annual KPMG Peat Marwick Surveys. The authors employed regression analysis to determine the relative importance of economic factors on an individual's probability of having employer-based coverage--as either a worker or dependent. In addition to providing a basis for measuring the impact of various factors on the level of coverage of workers and dependents during the 1989 to 1996 period, these models also allowed projection of coverage levels in future years under alternative assumptions about premium growth, employee contribution shares, and other economic factors.",https://doi.org/10.2190/r35f-afy5-cdf3-44vh,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10450543/,economics

"Both economic and public health/medical perspectives play an important role in the policy process, but often approach policy questions in an incompatible way. Economics and public health perspectives can complement each other, although harnessing any synergy requires an understanding of the other perspective. This article contrasts the two perspectives and reviews existing economic research in physical activity. Much effort has gone into producing cost-of-illness numbers or cost-offset claims with limited value from an economic perspective, although some simple steps could make them more informative. A more notable advance for active living research would be the adoption of standardized cost-effectiveness analysis methods, even just as an add-on to ongoing intervention trials. Probably the most challenging and exciting area, however, is the emerging research on the interaction between environmental incentives and physical activity. An economic perspective with its explicit focus on market failures is an important complement to ongoing active living research as policymakers in the United States are more likely to rely on the market to solve policy problems than on regulation. It is imperative to understand how the market works in actuality, not in the abstract, an area wide open for empirical research.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2004.10.021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15694522/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Our contribution aims to explore the different ways in which early economic data can inform public health policy decisions on new medical technologies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature research was conducted to detect methodological contributions covering the health policy perspective.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Early economic data on new technologies can support public health policy decisions in several ways. Embedded in horizon scanning and HTA activities, it adds to monitoring and assessment of innovations. It can play a role in the control of technology diffusion by informing coverage and reimbursement decisions as well as the direct public promotion of healthcare technologies, leading to increased efficiency. Major problems include the uncertainty related to economic data at early stages as well as the timing of the evaluation of an innovation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Decision-makers can benefit from the information supplied by early economic data, but the actual use in practice is difficult to determine.

"Objective:
        
      
      To examine the impact of provider competition under global budgeting on the use of cesarean delivery in Taiwan.
    


          Data sources/study setting:
        
      
      (1) Quarterly inpatient claims data of all clinics and hospitals with birth-related expenses from 2000 to 2008; (2) file of health facilities' basic characteristics; and (3) regional quarterly point values (price conversion index) for clinics and hospitals, respectively, from the fourth quarter in 1999 to the third quarter in 2008, from the Statistics of the National Health Insurance Administration.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Panel data of quarterly facility-level cesarean delivery rates with provider characteristics, birth volumes, and regional point values are analyzed with the fractional response model to examine the effect of external price changes on provider behavior in birth delivery services.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      The decline in de facto prices of health services as a result of noncooperative competition under global budgeting is associated with an increase in cesarean delivery rates, with a high degree of response heterogeneity across different types of provider facilities.
    


          Conclusions:

"Background:
        
      
      Hospital policy involves multiple objectives: efficiency of service delivery, pursuit of high quality care, promoting access. Funding policy based on hospital casemix has traditionally been considered to be only about promoting efficiency.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Formula-based funding policy can be (and has been) used to pursue a range of policy objectives, not only efficiency. These are termed 'adjunct' goals. Strategies to incorporate adjunct goals into funding design must, implicitly or explicitly, address key decision choices outlined in this paper.
    


          Summary:

"Since the late 1990s, particularly since the global financial crisis, the core inflation of main developed economies' has been persistently below target. The factors hindering the achievement of inflation targets are nothing more than commodity price, oil supply, weakness of aggregate demand, and various other factors. In addition, technology and globalization have also played a significant role. This paper uses an extended hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) model to quantify the contribution of technology and globalization variables to inflation in the United States (U.S.). The analysis suggests that technology and globalization well explain the low inflation dynamics in the U.S., as the impact of globalization on domestic inflation has been weakening over the past 20 years or so, while the impact of technology on inflation has been increasing. At present, technology exerts a greater role than globalization on low-inflation in the U.S.. This raises a different perspective for understanding the phenomenon of low inflation in the U.S. and other regions.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215366,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30998700/,economics
"The general and structural crisis capitalism is going through is the token of the difficulties accumulation model has been dealing with since 70's in developed countries. This model has been trying to settle down again on the basis of neoliberal principle and a new technical-economical paradigm. The new accumulation pattern has had a effect in employment sphere which have been made evident at all the elements that constitute work relationships. In Colombia, this model implementation has been partial and segmented. However, its consequences (and the long-term current crisis) have been evident in unemployment, precarious work, segmentation, informal work and restricted and private health insurance. Besides, financial accumulation makes labour profits flow at different levels. The economic model current government has aimed to implement leads to strengthening exports, so making population life conditions more difficult. In order to overcome the current state of affairs, the work sphere needs to become more creative. This creative approach should look for new schemes for expression and mobilization of work sphere's claims.

"The administrative costs of providing health insurance in the US are very high, but their determinants are poorly understood. We advance the nascent literature in this field by developing new measures of billing complexity for physician care across insurers and over time, and by estimating them using a large sample of detailed insurance ""remittance data"" for the period 2013-15. We found dramatic variation across different types of insurance. Fee-for-service Medicaid is the most challenging type of insurer to bill, with a claim denial rate that is 17.8 percentage points higher than that for fee-for-service Medicare. The denial rate for Medicaid managed care was 6 percentage points higher than that for fee-for-service Medicare, while the rate for private insurance appeared similar to that of Medicare Advantage. Based on conservative assumptions, we estimated that the health care sector deals with $11 billion in challenged revenue annually, but this number could be as high as $54 billion.

"There is a growing need for investments in hospital facilities to improve the efficiency and quality of health services. In recent years, publicly financed hospital organisations in many countries have utilised private finance arrangements, variously called private finance initiatives (PFIs), public-private partnerships (PPPs) or P3s, to address their capital requirements. However, such projects have become more difficult to implement since the onset of the global financial crisis, which has led to a reduction in the supply of debt capital and an increase in its price. In December 2012, the government of the United Kingdom outlined a comprehensive set of reforms to the private finance model in order to revive this important source of capital for hospital investments. This article provides a critical assessment of the 'Private Finance 2' reforms, focusing on their likely impact on the supply and cost of capital. It concludes that constraints in supply are likely to continue, in part due to regulatory constraints facing both commercial banks and institutional investors, while the cost of capital is likely to increase, at least in the short term.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.09.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24138730/,economics
"This article considers how specialist hospital services in the UK fared under Conservative health policy, with its emphasis on market-like arrangements, and what looks likely under the New Labour era, where new shibboleths (cooperation, quality, etc.) supposedly are in place. There appeared inherent in the Conservative health policy threats to specialist services from local competition, and purchaser agendas for local health needs of equity and prioritization. Moreover, small providers grappled with costs and the bureaucracy engendered by market-like arrangements and with their inability to make economies of scale. From the policy rhetoric since the New Labour election victory of May 1997, one might expect such specialist services to be 'coming in from the cold', but the reality seems quite different. In particular, this paper will outline the policy context for specialist providers for the period in the 1990s when the Conservative government undertook to reform the NHS. We also, through the Unit that is the subject of the case study, examine the actual effects of those reforms on this specialist service. Finally, we reflect further upon the resonances for specialist services in the New Labour era that can be gleaned from the case study.",https://doi.org/10.1177/095148480101400404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11725591/,economics
"This paper identifies the information that economic evaluation should provide to adequately inform policy-makers. First, policy-makers need cost-effectiveness information that is both internally and externally valid. The latter aspect is often ignored and refers to the relevance of the results of economic trials to the specific decision-making context of the policy-maker. Second, policy-makers, like purchasers of care, may want assessments of the overall budget and health impacts of adopting an intervention in a disease or treatment area. This requires more of an aggregate analysis than the current approaches to economic evaluation (which are typically individual-orientated). There are 3 main conceptual approaches to economic evaluation: the use of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies and modelling. The RCT can be considered as the gold standard in economic evaluation because of its high internal validity, but results should be interpreted with caution because of its low external validity. There a number of options to enhance external validity; of these, additional modelling and observational data seem to be the most promising. To address issues at the system level, disease modelling or public health modelling is suggested. A 3-step approach, comprising successive assessment of internal validity, external validity (real world relevance) and net impact at the system level, can enhance the informative value of economic analyses. For example, this approach has been used to assess the informative value to decision-makers of an RCT in benign prostatic hyperplasia. The analysis emphasised the feasibility and importance of additional modelling beyond the results from an RCT-based economic analysis and provided important information of relevance for policy-making. Because of the need to increase the real world relevance of pharmacoeconomic analyses, there is potentially a large role for modelling in economic evaluation; however, in order to enhance its credibility, more attention should be paid to validity aspects.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199916050-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10662392/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Both endoluminal gastroplication and radiofrequency coagulation of the lower esophageal sphincter and gastroesophageal junction (Stretta procedure) represent emerging endoscopic therapies for GERD. The economic impact of endotherapy for GERD has not been described. The aim of this study was to apply a decision analysis model to compare the costs of endoluminal gastroplication vs. the Stretta procedures vs. a proton pump inhibitor for treatment of GERD. A cost minimization approach was used.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Model entry criteria were GERD responsive to daily or twice daily administration of a proton pump inhibitor. Performance characteristics of endotherapy were determined from published data. The baseline probabilities for annual endotherapy failure rates (20%), partial failure rates (10%), and complication rates (1%) were varied through a plausible range by using sensitivity analysis. Cost data for endotherapy were calculated from per case instrumentation costs plus professional fees plus facility fees for ambulatory patient classification codes; cost of treatment with a proton pump inhibitor was based on national average wholesale price. The endpoint was sustained resolution of GERD symptoms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In patients requiring twice daily use of a proton pump inhibitor for symptom relief, endotherapy proves to be the most economical strategy after 17 months. If uniform endotherapy failure rates over time are assumed, medication regains superiority after 29 months. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a proton pump inhibitor remains the most economical option beyond 3 years, provided annual endotherapy failure rates remain greater than 20% (endoluminal gastroplication) or 19% (Stretta). Pharmacotherapy is the least costly approach, irrespective of time, if the daily cost of a proton pump inhibitor is less than $140 a month or endotherapy costs more than $3400. For patients in whom symptoms are relieved with once daily dosing with a proton pump inhibitor, medication remains the most economical option regardless of endotherapy failure rate.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Endotherapy appears to offer an economical treatment option for patients requiring a proton pump inhibitor twice daily, with its cost superiority enduring for 2.5 years. More long-term follow-up data are required to determine the durability of the endotherapy benefit over time.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0016-5107(03)01889-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14520279/,economics

"Value-based purchasing, or pay-for-performance, is a major emerging theme in U.S. health care.

This paper showed the first holistic and quantitative SEA case study on that by developing a country-specific SEA framwork and methodologies and applying the case of HBCD phase-out in China under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). The study indicates that, under the possible scenarios of 10 years and 5 years , the economic costs of HBCD phase-out in China would be between 9.032 and 19.021 billion RMB. Although the total economic costs seems to be significant, it would only have a marginal impact on the house building industry with a likely cost increase by about 0.07‰-0.14‰. Meanwhile, the HBCD phase-out may render significant environmental and health benefits, including about 23-29 tons of HBCD release prevented to the environment, 1.142-1.469 million tons of potentially HBCD contained hazardous wastes avoided, along with significant reduction from 58% up to almost 100% in local environmental concentrations of HBCD, and about 0.0996-0.128 million workers at risk avoided and at least 3.067-4.033 billion RMB of the health care savings.

The results suggest that an increase in debt from subsidized loan sources (i.e., Guaranteed Student Loans, National Direct Student Loans, or Health Professions Student Loans) has mixed effects while an increase in debt from Health Education Assistance Loans reduces the likelihood of becoming a primary care physician.

"Low back pain (LBP) poses an economic burden to society, mainly in terms of the large number of work days lost by a small percentage of patients who develop chronic LBP. The object of this review is to gain a better understanding of the societal costs of LBP and to see whether current clinical management follows evidence-based guidelines and is economically attractive, by reviewing studies on LBP with economic implications. To this end, the Medline database was searched between 1996 and 2001 using appropriate keywords, broadly defined. A total of 372 abstracts were screened and paper copies of 73 potentially relevant articles were obtained. It was found that the cost of LBP illness was high and was comparable to other disorders such as headache, heart disease, depression or diabetes, but actual cost estimates varied depending on the costing methodology employed. A small percentage of patients with chronic LBP accounts for a large fraction of the costs. Excessive and inappropriate use of diagnostic or therapeutic services can be documented but varied by region and provider type. Management according to evidence-based guidelines was not necessarily economically attractive. Interventions for acute or chronic LBP failed to show economic benefits, but demonstrated modest clinical benefits, which suggested a weak relationship between clinical and economic outcomes. The conclusion was that common definitions and costing methodologies need to be found to gain a better understanding of the true costs to society and to make studies comparable. A better definition is needed for the type for patient with LBP for whom therapeutic management is most likely to have a long-lasting economic benefit.",https://doi.org/10.1053/berh.2001.0204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11987929/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The hospital cost of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the United States is a major growing expense for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Many hospitals are unable to deliver TKA with profitable or breakeven economics under the current Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) hospital reimbursement system.
    


          Questions/purposes:
        
      
      The purposes of the current study were to (1) determine revenue, expenses, and profitability (loss) for TKA for all patients and for different payors; (2) define changes in utilization and unit costs associated with this operation; and (3) describe TKA cost control strategies to provide insight for hospitals to improve their economic results for TKA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 1991 to 2009, Lahey Clinic converted a $2172 loss per case on primary TKA in 1991 to a $2986 profit per case in 2008. The improved economics was associated with decreasing revenue in inflation-adjusted dollars and implementation of hospital cost control programs that reduced hospital expenses for TKA. Reduction of hospital length of stay and reduction of knee implant costs were the major drivers of hospital expense reduction.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      During the last 25 years, our economic experience with TKA is concerning. Hospital revenues have lagged behind inflation, hospital expenses have been reduced, and our institution is earning a profit. However, the margin for TKA is decreasing and Managed Medicare patients do not generate a profit. The erosion of hospital revenue for TKA will become a critical issue if it leads to economic losses for hospitals or reduced access to TKA.

Pricing was achieved with a combination of activity-based costing with data from selected Greek hospitals, and ""imported"" cost weights. Data collection, IT support and monitoring are provided via ESY.net, a web-based facility developed and implemented by the MoH.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After an initial pilot testing of the classification in 20 hospitals, complete DRG reimbursement data was reported by 113 hospitals (85% of total) for the fourth quarter of 2011. The recorded monthly increase in patient discharges billed with the new system and in revenue implies increasing adaptability by the hospitals. However, the unfavorable inlier vs. outlier distribution of discharges and revenue observed in some health regions signifies the need for corrective actions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The importance of this reimbursement reform is discussed in light of the current crisis faced by the Greek economy. There is yet much to be done and many projects are currently in progress to support this effort; however the first cost containment results are encouraging.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2012.09.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23062311/,economics
"Various methods have been proposed to address uncertainty in economic evaluations of healthcare programmes. One approach suggested in the literature is to estimate separate confidence intervals for the incremental costs and effects of a new health programme in comparison with an existing programme. These intervals are then combined to generate a rectangular confidence region in the cost-effectiveness plane that implicitly defines a corresponding confidence interval for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The same approach has been used to calculate sample sizes and study power. This application of the rectangle method is consistent with the adoption of ICERs and a threshold as a decision rule, this being the most commonly used approach in empirical applications of cost-effectiveness analysis, as well as the one recommended by agencies that assess medical technology around the world. In this paper, we first outline the rectangle method, and then propose a modification that recognises that separate inferences are being drawn on the cost and effectiveness domains, and that corrects for multiple statistical comparisons. The confidence rectangle is otherwise too small, the corresponding confidence interval for the ICER is too narrow and sample sizes are under-estimated. Our modification corrects these problems. A further difficulty is that the placement of the confidence rectangle around the null value is somewhat arbitrary, and does not correspond to a unique value of ICERs. As a result, different values of sample size and power for the estimation of ICERs can be obtained, depending on the null values of the cost and effectiveness. We conclude that it is important to clearly identify the analytic goal in terms of estimating differential costs, differential effects or a combination of the two using the ICER index. These ideas are illustrated using numerical examples.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200725060-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17523751/,economics
"This paper addresses the use of economic evaluation to inform resource allocation decisions within health care systems about which interventions to reimburse and whether additional research should be funded. A social decision-making view of economic evaluation, that is to maximize health gains subject to an exogenous budget constraint, is adopted. A brief overview of the components of an economic evaluation is presented. Particular attention is paid to how uncertainty is inherent to decisions about resource allocation, the consequences of that uncertainty and how it can be incorporated informatively into economic evaluation. A Bayesian approach to uncertainty is used as it meets the needs of social decision-making, allowing analysts to quantify the probability that an intervention is cost-effective given the available evidence and to quantify the expected value of further research. The discussion covers methods to represent parameter and structural uncertainty and considers the role of formal elicitation of expert judgements. The association between decisions to approve interventions for reimbursement and decisions about future research funding, and how value of information analysis can be used to formalize this link, is explained. Recent developments in the UK highlight the evolving policy environment for economic evaluation, such as the Cooksey report on the funding of UK health research, the review of the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme by the Office of Fair Trading and the update of the methodological guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The paper concludes by describing ongoing methodological work designed to meet the challenges of undertaking decision analysis for resource allocation in health care.",https://doi.org/10.1258/jhsrp.2008.008017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18806189/,economics
"Throughout this century, profit has been an underlying motor force for health sector developments. However, as the concentration and centralization of health care delivery has proceeded in the United States, the pursuit of profit has become central. Even before the Reagan policy redirections raised ""marketplace efficiency"" as the supreme determinant of how the population's health needs are to be (or actually will not be) met, the rise of the nationwide proprietary hospital conglomerates over the last 15 years signified a new organization form. No longer camouflaged under an out-moded ""not-for-profit"" designation, the delivery of health care is now officially to be a ""business"" run for economic gain. Corporatization and proprietization trends have unmasked that profit regulates which people in which social groups get care. This article focuses upon developments which people in which social groups get care. This article focuses upon developments leading toward this monopolization within health services delivery. Specific attention is given to historical tendencies that have set the stage for its extension under conditions of a continuing general economic crisis, conservative health policy redirections, and rapid industrialization of the health sector. Scientific and technological advances have reshaped professional roles and relationships, and increased bureaucratization of provider organizations. Coinciding with these are major actions by the corporate class in health policy and planning, and an impending demographic shift where aging population cohorts give rise to expanding ""markets"" of middle-class patients for proprietary health care firms.",https://doi.org/10.2190/hk8w-3b1q-uwjq-6dew,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4055181/,economics
"This paper addresses the use of health economics in relation to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the Armed Forces, with a view to assessing the feasibility of carrying out future evaluative studies. Although psychological and pharmacological interventions can be used to treat PTSD, no economic evaluations are known to exist. There is an economic burden associated with PTSD, and treatments require the use of scarce resources. Health economics provides tools (including cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, and cost-utility analyses) to ascertain the relative efficiency of different treatment options. The paper concludes that the quality of life and resource consequences of PTSD require a better understanding of the economics of the disorder and the alternative ways to treat it.",https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1025722930935,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14584638/,economics
"Objectives and methods:
        
      
      Health technology assessment (HTA) often requires the identification and review of economic evaluations and models. This study surveys the available specific and general resources to search to identify economic evaluations. It also provides information on efficient searching of those resources and comments on the current evidence-base.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Published checklists recommend searching for economic evaluations in specific information resources which collect economic evaluations such as NHS EED and HEED, followed by top-up searches of large biomedical bibliographic databases (such as MEDLINE and EMBASE). Other resources such as the HTA and DARE databases can yield reports of economic evaluations. Searches within NHS EED and HEED can be made more efficient by using database-specific search options. Searches within large biomedical databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE require the use of economic search terms called search filters. Search filters are highly sensitive, retrieving most economic evaluations, but suffer from low precision returning many irrelevant records which need to be assessed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is relatively easy to identify rapidly a high proportion of economic evaluations but more research is required to improve the efficiency of this process. There are key high yield resources to search but more evidence is required on their overlap and unique contribution to searches. The value of other resources, particularly those providing access to gray literature, should be explored. Research into efficient retrieval requires clear definitions of economic evaluations to allow comparison across studies.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462310000991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20942986/,economics
"Model-based economic evaluations should capture the impact on all costs and outcomes relevant to the chosen study perspective and time horizon. This editorial defines what is meant by direct treatment disutility (DTD) and describes why it could be an important harm that those designing model-based evaluations should consider. Some existing estimates of DTD identified from the current literature are summarised in terms of the methods used to elicit the values and the size of the estimated DTD. Model-based studies that include DTDs are also summarised. It was found that the values used within model-based economic evaluations (ranging from 0.00384 to 0.02) were typically smaller than the directly elicited values from the existing literature (0-0.033). Yet even with conservative estimates of DTDs, cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to their inclusion. The editorial concludes by discussing future methodological and empirical research needed to estimate more robust DTD values.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-015-0357-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26645572/,economics
"This article discusses the evolving field of pharmacogenomics, which is the science of using genomic markers to predict drug response, and how it may impact the future costs, risks and returns to pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). We uncover a number of factors and issues that are likely to influence the expected returns and, hence, the incentive to invest in new pharmaceutical R&D in tandem with the development of pharmacogenomics. Specifically, we identify how pharmacogenomics may lower the cost of drug development by shortening drug development times. Thus, pharmacogenomics may lead to an increase in a drug's effective patent life, and may also increase the demand and adoption rate for new products. For these and other reasons, pharmacogenomics may one day enhance expected future returns to R&D, leading to higher levels of R&D investment and an increased pace of pharmaceutical innovation. Our conclusions must be read with much caution, however, as there is considerable uncertainty as to how the area will evolve, both clinically and economically. The time horizon necessary for the science to develop and be adopted into clinical practice is not clear. Nevertheless, we think the issues and factors outlined in this article shed light on possible future economic outcomes and changes in the industry's structure, conduct and performance. Hopefully, this will provide researchers with avenues to pursue regarding a better understanding of the economics of pharmacogenomics.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200927050-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19586074/,economics
"Drug coverage decisions require information about clinically relevant benefits and risks, as well as economic information about direct and indirect costs, in comparison with relevant treatment alternatives. A recent Canadian initiative aims to improve the evidentiary basis for drug coverage decisions through centralised evaluation of the clinical and economic value of new drug products. Centralised review can make important, 'positive' contributions to decision making by raising the evidentiary basis for decisions. Even in the absence of a single-payer for medicines, such information can directly inform decisions focussed on matters of technical efficiency. Centralised review also provides necessary but not sufficient information for the many decisions in this sector that concern allocative efficiency and therefore have 'normative' implications. Thus, in addition to processes for collecting and critically assessing clinical and economic data, effective priority setting requires processes at a local level for engaging affected populations in the consideration of the trade-offs inherent in coverage decisions.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00148365-200605020-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16872248/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To calculate the public health impact and economic benefit of using ancillary health care professionals for routine postoperative care.
    


          Background:
        
      
      The need for specialty surgical care far exceeds its supply, particularly in weight loss surgery. Bariatric surgery is cost-effective and the only effective long-term weight loss strategy for morbidly obese patients. Without clinically appropriate task shifting, surgeons, hospitals, and untreated patients incur a high opportunity cost.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Visit schedules, time per visit, and revenues were obtained from bariatric centers of excellence. Case-specific surgeon fees were derived from published Current Procedural Terminology data. The novel Microsoft Excel model was allowed to run until a steady state was evident (status quo). This model was compared with one in which the surgeon participates in follow-up visits beyond 3 months only if there is a complication (task shifting). Changes in operative capacity and national quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the status quo model, per capita surgical volume capacity equilibrates at 7 surgical procedures per week, with 27% of the surgeon's time dedicated to routine long-term follow-up visits. Task shifting increases operative capacity by 38%, resulting in 143,000 to 882,000 QALYs gained annually. Per surgeon, task shifting achieves an annual increase of 95 to 588 QALYs, $5 million in facility revenue, 48 cases of cure of obstructive sleep apnea, 44 cases of remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 35 cases of cure of hypertension.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Optimal resource allocation through task shifting is economically appealing and can achieve dramatic public health benefit by increasing access to specialty surgery.",https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000000656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24743608/,economics

Three key concepts must be addressed: nursing education costs for both service and educational institutions, defining nursing education in federal rules and regulations, and the community's role in supporting nursing education. Responsibility for educating a nursing workforce must be shared by the community of academic, health care, professional, and government institutions and organizations, a policy supported by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). Knowledge about costs, funding streams, and policies for nursing education is essential for nursing educators to advocate for funding of nursing education and practice.

"We presented a general overview of the health care system as well as the pricing and reimbursement environment in Poland. Poland aims to ensure proper access to safe and effective medicines while reducing patients' share in treatment costs. Nevertheless, the co-payment for pharmacotherapy is still high (more than 60%). The key policymaker and regulator in the system is the Ministry of Health, which is supported by the Polish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Tariff System (Agencja Oceny Technologii Medycznych i Taryfikacji), responsible for evaluating applicant drugs, and the Economic Commission, responsible for negotiating the official sales prices and conditions for reimbursement with pharmaceutical companies (e.g., level of reimbursement and risk-sharing scheme agreements). The Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Tariff System dossier is obligatory for reimbursement application and includes the analysis of clinical effectiveness, economic analysis (with the threshold of quality-adjusted life-year established as no more than 3 times the gross domestic product per capita), and the analysis of budget impact. In Poland, only a positive list of reimbursed drugs is published and it is updated every 2 months. The following levels of reimbursement are in use: 100%, 70%, 50%, and lump sum (about €0.8). The first reimbursement decision is given for a period of 2 years only, the second for 3 years, and the third for 5 years. There is no separate budget or special legal regulations for orphan drugs. Generic substitution of drugs is desired but not mandatory. Physicians are not assigned with pharmaceutical budgets.

"Importance:
        
      
      The economic impact of continuous professional development (CPD) education is incompletely understood.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically identify and synthesize published research examining the costs associated with physician CPD for drug prescribing.
    


          Evidence review:
        
      
      MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database were searched from inception to April 23, 2020, for comparative studies that evaluated the cost of CPD focused on drug prescribing. Two reviewers independently screened all articles for inclusion and reviewed all included articles to extract data on participants, educational interventions, study designs, and outcomes (costs and effectiveness). Results were synthesized for educational costs, health care costs, and cost-effectiveness.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Of 3338 articles screened, 38 were included in this analysis. These studies included at least 15 659 health care professionals and 1 963 197 patients. Twelve studies reported on educational costs, ranging from $281 to $183 554 (median, $15 664). When economic outcomes were evaluated, 31 of 33 studies (94%) comparing CPD with no intervention found that CPD was associated with reduced health care costs (drug costs), ranging from $4731 to $6 912 000 (median, $79 373). Four studies found reduced drug costs for 1-on-1 outreach compared with other CPD approaches. Regarding cost-effectiveness, among 5 studies that compared CPD with no intervention, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a 10% improvement in prescribing ranged from $15 390 to $437 027 to train all program participants. Four comparisons of alternative CPD approaches found that 1-on-1 educational outreach was more effective but more expensive than group education or mailed materials (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $18-$4105 per physician trained).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this systematic review, CPD for drug prescribing was associated with reduced health care (drug) costs. The educational costs and cost-effectiveness of CPD varied widely. Several CPD instructional approaches (including educational outreach) were more effective but more costly than comparators.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.44973,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35080604/,economics
"In the midst of high cost of health care both at the macro and micro levels, health insurance becomes a viable alternative for financing health care in Ghana. It is also a way of mobilising private funds for improving health care delivery at the macro level. This study uses a contingent valuation method to assess the willingness of households in the informal sector of Ghana to join and pay premiums for a proposed National Health Insurance scheme. Focus group discussions, in-depth and structured interviews were used to collect data for the study. There was a high degree of acceptance of health insurance in all the communities surveyed. Over 90% of the respondents agreed to participate in the scheme and up to 63.6% of the respondents were willing to pay a premium of 5000 cents or $3.03 a month for a household of five persons. Using an ordered probit model, the level of premiums households were willing to pay were found to be influenced by dependency ratio, income or whether a household has difficulty in paying for health care or not, sex, health care expenditures and education. As income increases, or the proportion of unemployed household members drop, people are willing to pay higher premiums for health insurance.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(97)00069-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10176302/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Budget impact analysis (BIA) is a relatively recent technique that is supposed to be complementary to more established economic evaluations (EEs).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We reviewed the BIAs published on drugs in the EU since December 2008, to assess whether these studies have improved in quality in the last few years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a literature search on the international databases PubMed and EMBASE. The selected articles were screened using a two-step approach to assess (1) their main methodological characteristics and (2) the level of adherence to the latest BIA definition. The assessment was made by two independent reviewers and any disagreement was resolved through discussion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eventually, 17 articles were reviewed. Thirteen referred to a stand-alone BIA not accompanying a full EE, only nine focussed on a new treatment, 15 were sponsored by the manufacturer of the drug of reference, all but one claiming savings for healthcare budgets. The quality of methods was poor in many of the studies, and only a few of them attempted to estimate real local costs in a credible way. Therefore, the crucial items that in theory make a BIA different from other types of EEs were often the major points of weakness of the studies reviewed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our review confirmed that the BIA is not yet a well-established technique in the literature and many published studies still fail to reach an acceptable quality. In particular, BIAs funded by pharmaceutical companies appear to be tailored to show short-term savings induced by new, highly priced products.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-013-0064-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24158922/,economics

"To summarize: Some economic literature treats price determination in the medical marketplace as if it were similar to that of a standard marketplace. It seems more realistic to treat it as an outcome of one or more administered price systems. Such systems, may be formula-based, as is common in the United States (for example, the Prospective Payment System), or not (for example, a negotiated budget). In either case, however, the actual price is likely to deviate from the ideal price in part for lack of information. Plausible deviations can explain some observed phenomena. The inability to attain the ideal price, together with heterogeneity of patients, may also explain why in practice we observe several different bases of provider payment; for example, fee-for-service, capitation, and salary. All of these may be attempts to arrive at second best prices. Ignoring any welfare loss from raising revenue and assuming those with the largest marginal social valuation for the service are served first, errors in price setting lead to a welfare loss that is approximately proportional to the square of the deviation from the ideal price. If price setting is unbiased (i.e., errors have a mean of zero), the welfare loss is approximately proportional to the variance of the error in setting price. If price setting is biased, welfare loss is approximately proportional to the variance plus the square of the bias. Taking account of welfare loss from raising revenue may make monopsonistic pricing optimal. If one uses multiple bases of payment, for example both fee-for-service and capitation, one can average the errors that arise in each basis. This creates a gain from using a mixed system, in addition to those gains cited by other analysts, who focus on the method of reimbursement assuming what, in the present context, could be termed error-free price effects. The gains from averaging errors would appear available in any administered price system and are compatible with a wide variety of models of provider behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-2392-1_1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10151751/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The assignment of prices or costs to pharmaceuticals can be crucial to results and conclusions that are derived from pharmacoeconomic cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs). Although numerous pharmacoeconomic practice guidelines are available in the literature and have been promulgated in many countries, these guidelines are either vague or silent about how drug costs should be established or measured. This is particularly problematic in pharmacoeconomic studies performed from the ""societal"" perspective, because typically the measured cost of a brand name pharmaceutical is not a true economic cost but also includes transfer payments from some members of society (patients and third party payers) to other members of society (pharmaceutical manufacturer stockholders) in large part as a reward for biomedical innovation. Moreover, there are numerous and complex institutional factors that influence how drug costs should be measured from other CEA perspectives, both internationally and within the domestic US context. The objective of this report is to provide guidance and recommendations on how drug costs should be measured for CEAs performed from a number of key analytic perspectives.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (Drug Cost Task Force [DCTF]) was appointed with the advice and consent of the ISPOR Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of CEA models, worked in academia, industry, and as advisors to governments, and came from several countries. Because how drug costs should be measured for CEAs depend on the perspectives, five Task Force subgroups were created to develop drug cost standards from the societal, managed care, US government, industry, and international perspective. The ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (DCTF) subgroups met to develop core assumptions and an outline before preparing six draft reports. They solicited comments on the outline and drafts from a core group of 174 external reviewers and more broadly from the membership of ISPOR at two ISPOR meetings and via the ISPOR web site.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Drug cost measurements should be fully transparent and reflect the net payment most relevant to the user's perspective. The Task Force recommends that for CEAs of brand name drugs performed from a societal perspective, either 1) CEA analysts use a cost that more accurately reflects true societal drug costs (e.g., 20-60% of average sales price), or when that is too unrealistic to be meaningful for decision-makers, 2) refer to their analyses as from a ""limited societal perspective."" CEAs performed from a payer perspective should use drug prices actually paid by the relevant payer net of all rebates, copays, or other adjustments. When such price adjustments are confidential, the analyst should apply a typical or average discount that preserves this confidentiality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Drug transaction prices not only ration current use of medication but also ration future biomedical research and development. CEA researchers should tailor the appropriate measure of drug costs to the analytic perspective, maintain clarity and transparency on drug cost measurement, and report the sensitivity of CEA results to reasonable drug cost measurement alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00663.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19874571/,economics

      There is an important need to evaluate therapeutic approaches for osteoarthritis (OA) in terms of cost-effectiveness as well as efficacy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The ESCEO expert working group met to discuss the epidemiological and economic evidence that justifies the increasing concern of the impact of this disease and reviewed the current state-of-the-art in health economic studies in this field.

      OA is a debilitating disease; it is increasing in frequency and is associated with a substantial and growing burden on society, in terms of both burden of illness and cost of illness. Economic evaluations in this field are relatively rare, and those that do exist, show considerable heterogeneity of methodological approach (such as indicated population, comparator, decision context and perspective, time horizon, modeling and outcome measures used). This heterogeneity makes comparisons between studies problematic.

"Background:
        
      
      The impact of the global economic meltdown on every sector of economic activity has been enormous, especially in the developing countries. Medical practice in these nations has been particularly challenged and stretched under this milieu. This paper thus sets out to evaluate the phenomenon of economic meltdown with its effects on the developing countries, the challenges it poses to medical practice, with Nigeria as a case study, and makes suggestions to address this scenario.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A review of the literature on economic meltdown with particular emphasis on the effect on medical practice, was done, with focus on the developing countries, and specifically Nigeria. Literature search was conducted using the Medline, Google search engine, the media, as well as national and localjournals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The definition and historical perspectives of global economic meltdown, as well as the geographical location of the developing countries, are set out. The peculiar economic challenges and those in the medical practice, with the concomitant glaring effects in the developing nations, with particular reference to the Nigerian situation, are outlined. Specific measures to adopt in addressing these challenges are suggested in this paper.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The peculiar challenges of the global economic meltdown on medical practice in the developing world, and in Nigeria particularly, must be addressed wholisticaly involving every sector of the economy, with fundamental policy and structural changes put in place.",https://doi.org/10.4314/njm.v18i4.51225,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20120137/,economics
"In most European countries, healthcare cost-containment programmes have failed to meet their targets on a long term basis. For this reason, decision-makers sought effective and rational strategies to assist in the optimal allocation of available resources. The scholarly discipline of economics provides methods and instruments for investigating the rational use of limited resources. In the context of these efforts, socioeconomic evaluations of healthcare programmes have become increasingly important during the last decade. A socioeconomic evaluation is an analysis of all costs and consequences over a relevant time-period for a particular healthcare intervention. For example, a socioeconomic evaluation of an influenza prevention programme should consider the total costs of preventing influenza (costs of the vaccine, vaccination programme and treatment of adverse events), as well as the benefits of such a programme (costs saved as a result of cases of influenza avoided). In general, socioeconomic evaluations usually compare costs and benefits relative to alternative treatment strategies. The core concepts of socioeconomic analyses are as follows: costs and consequences, discounting, marginal and incremental costs, and externalities (spill-over effects). All these concepts are fixed components of published guidelines and should be considered when conducting a socioeconomic evaluation.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199916001-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10623372/,economics
"Each month, 200,000 widows and 6,000 widowers receive Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits, each benefit averaging about $550. Among the most economically at-risk Social Security beneficiaries, their benefits are permanently reduced. This paper reviews the legislative history of the disabled widow(er)s benefit, identifying key decisions that gave shape to this benefit. Social Security program data and six years of Current Population Survey data (March Annual Demographic Files, 1995-2000) are used to profile the economic status of current and potential disabled widows. The analysis, including comparison with other widows, provides strong evidence of economic need among disabled widows with, for example, 44% of disabled widow beneficiaries, ages 50-59, having below-poverty incomes compared with 15% of like-aged non-disabled widows. We conclude that serious consideration should be given to extending eligibility to all widow(er)s disabled before the normal retirement age; to providing a benefit equal to 100% of the deceased spouse's private insurance amount (PIA); to eliminating the unnecessarily restrictive seven-year rule; and to protecting beneficiaries from losing their eligibility to Medicaid. Even in the context of today's heated Social Security debate, we suggest that a rare opportunity may exist to garner bipartisan support for meaningful, low-cost improvements, in a benefit that primarily targets women.",https://doi.org/10.1300/j031v19n01_03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17347116/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Each country in the European Union (EU) currently employs direct price controls or permutations of direct price controls, such as reference pricing or limitations on returns to capital. Some countries also use volume controls. A new proposal that is being discussed would have all of the countries in the EU adopt uniform pricing for each pharmaceutical.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This paper analyzes the economic effects of free-market pricing individual-country price controls, and uniform EU price controls.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Microeconomic and mathematical models were used to simulate and predict probable economic outcomes in a comparative static setting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Price controls may be in the form of price ceilings or price floors. Both forms of price control generate deadweight economic losses in the short run and long run. A uniform EU price for each pharmaceutical sold there would have elements of a price ceiling in some of the countries and of a price floor in other countries. The deadweight loss incurred would be a function of the level at which the uniform price was set by the EU and the price elasticity of demand for each pharmaceutical in each country.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economic efficiency is maximized in both the short run and long run when prices are set in freely competitive markets. An additional important dimension of Ramsey pricing within a competitive context is that it generates funds for investment in pharmaceutical research and development, which enhances economic efficiency in the long run.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0149-2918(04)80209-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15476914/,economics

"Background/objective: To describe the design of 'DepMod,' a health-economic Markov model for assessing cost-effectiveness and budget impact of user-defined preventive interventions and treatments in depressive disorders.Methods: DepMod has an epidemiological layer describing how a cohort of people can transition between health states (sub-threshold depression, first episode of mild, moderate or severe depression (partial) remission, recurrence, death). Superimposed on the epidemiological layer, DepMod has an intervention layer consisting of a reference scenario and alternative scenario comparing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a user-defined package of preventive interventions and psychological and pharmacological treatments of depression. Results are presented in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and healthcare expenditure. Costs and effects can be modeled over 5 years and are subjected to probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Results: DepMod was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of scaling up preventive interventions for treating people with subclinical depression, which showed that there is an 82% probability that scaling up prevention is cost-effective given a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY.Conclusion: DepMod is a Markov model that assesses the cost-utility and budget impact of different healthcare packages aimed at preventing and treating depression and is freely available for academic purposes upon request at the authors.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1844566,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33119427/,economics
"This article aims to define a value-based approach to pricing and reimbursement for off-patent originators using a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach centered on a systematic analysis of current pricing and reimbursement policies in China. A drug price policy review was combined with a quantitative analysis of China's drug purchasing database. Policy preferences were identified through a MCDA performed by interviewing well-known academic experts and industry stakeholders. The study findings indicate that the current Chinese price policy includes cost-based pricing and the establishment of maximum retail prices and premiums for off-patent originators, whereas reference pricing may be adopted in the future. The literature review revealed significant differences in the dissolution profiles between originators and generics; therefore, dissolution profiles need to be improved. Market data analysis showed that the overall price ratio of generics and off-patent originators was around 0.54-0.59 in 2002-2011, with a 40% price difference, on average. Ten differentiating value attributes were identified and MCDA was applied to test the impact of three pricing policy scenarios. With the condition of implementing quality consistency regulations and controls, a reduction in the price gap between high-quality off-patent products (including originator and generics) seemed to be the preferred policy. Patents of many drugs will expire within the next 10 years; thus, pricing will be an issue of importance for off-patent originators and generic alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-014-0150-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26091710/,economics

The analysis employs a long-differences design to examine cost growth before and after the managed care backlash. Results from the early 1990s are consistent with prior evidence that the combination of more competitive markets and high managed care penetration held down costs. Post-backlash, high managed care penetration no longer was associated with lower cost growth in the most competitive markets, indicating that the synergistic effects between managed care and hospital competition no longer may exist.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_45.01.98,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18524295/,economics
"In 2003, a lump-sum payment system based on Diagnosis Procedure Combinations (DPC) was introduced to 82 specific function hospitals in Japan. While the US DRG/PPS system is a ""per case payment"" system, the DPC based payment system adopts a ""per day payment."" It is generally believed that the Japanese system provides as much of an incentive as the DRG/PPS system to shorten the average length of stay (LOS). We performed an empirical analysis of the effect of LOS shortening on hospital revenue and expenditure under the DPC-based payment system, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. We also point out fundamentally controversial aspects of the current system. A total 109 cases were selected from patients hospitalized at the University of Tokyo Hospital from May to July, 2003 and classified into one of three categories: (1) cardiac catheter interventions, (2) cardiac catheter examinations, and (3) other conservative treatments. We analyzed the changes in profit per day in cases of a reduction in average LOS and an increase in the number of cases. In category (1) profit increased significantly in conjunction with reduced LOS. In category (2) profit increased only minimally. In category (3), profit increased rarely and sometimes decreased. In cases of conservative treatment, profits sometimes decreased because an increase in material costs exceeded the increase in revenue. It therefore became clear that the DPC-based payment system does not decisively provide an economic incentive to reduce LOS in cardiovascular medicine.",https://doi.org/10.1536/ihj.46.855,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16272776/,economics
"Ten years ago we developed a model of demand inducement in the physician services market and explored the properties of that model. We found that predictions concerning physicians' prices, workloads, and income were ambiguous and in many cases were consistent with those derived from a standard monopoly pricing model. Spurred in part by our work, numerous empirical studies of the demand inducement model have been conducted. These studies found little evidence of demand inducement for primary care physician services. Demand inducement may exist in the market for surgical services, but its extent is less than previously estimated. We disagree with those who say that physicians generate demand to avoid price controls and that national health care spending is proportional to the number of physicians; the evidence does not support these arguments. Substantial uncertainty may surround the physician's choice of diagnosis and treatment mode. However, this does not imply a breakdown of the agency relationship. In this paper we extend our earlier model of demand inducement to include variations in the quantity of services (which was previously assumed to be less than socially ideal). Using the model, we conclude that the major objection to government price setting is not that physicians will get around the controls by inducing demand; rather, price controls result in a quantity and quality of physicians' services that is not ideal and may be inferior to those provided in an unregulated monopoly.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-13-2-239,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3385167/,economics
"We sought to summarize and assess original evaluations of the economic impact of clinical pharmacy services published from 1996-2000, and to provide recommendations and methodologic considerations for future research. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify articles that were then blinded and randomly assigned to reviewers who confirmed inclusion and abstracted key information. Results were compared with those of a similar review of literature published from 1988-1995. In the 59 included articles, the studies were conducted across a variety of practice sites that consisted of hospitals (52%), community pharmacies and clinics (41%), health maintenance organizations (3%), and long-term or intermediate care facilities (3%). They focused on a broad range of clinical pharmacy services such as general pharmacotherapeutic monitoring (47%), target drug programs (20%), disease management programs (10%), and patient education or cognitive services (10%). Compared with the studies of the previous review, a greater proportion of evaluations were conducted in community pharmacies or clinics, and the types of services evaluated tended to be more comprehensive rather than specialized. Articles were categorized by type of evaluation: 36% were considered outcome analyses, 24% full economic analyses, 17% outcome descriptions, 15% cost and outcome descriptions, and 8% cost analyses. Compared with the studies of the previous review, a greater proportion of studies in the current review used more rigorous study designs. Most studies reported positive financial benefits of the clinical pharmacy service evaluated. In 16 studies, a benefit:cost ratio was reported by the authors or was able to be calculated by the reviewers (these ranged from 1.7:1-17.0:1, median 4.68:1). The body of literature from this 5-year period provides continued evidence of the economic benefit of clinical pharmacy services. Although the quality of study design has improved, whenever possible, future evaluations of this type should incorporate methodologies that will further enhance the strength of evidence of this literature and the conclusions that may be drawn from it.",https://doi.org/10.1592/phco.23.1.113.31910,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12523470/,economics

Key issues include: the cost of disability, the family impacts, displacement from the labor force, social benefit and disability policies, and the application of cost/benefit analysis to these processes-the tool and its limitations. Available research confirms the United Nation study finding that while disability will create a cost in every society regardless of whether or not rehabilitation services exist, ""the more a society recognizes these costs, and the more it attempts to ameliorate them through provision of adequate disability prevention and rehabilitation services, the greater is the overall economic return that may be expected.""",https://doi.org/10.1097/00004356-198206000-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6214513/,economics
"In recent times, the topic of smoking has been extensively debated in Hungary. A new Act has been issued for the protection of non-smokers and for the regulation of tobacco product distribution.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      The aim of the authors was to examine the economic burden of smoking on the society.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      According to wildly accepted estimates, 30% of the Hungarian population smokes. Smoking leads to the development of several diseases, for example, it is responsible for 90% of lung cancer cases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      17.2% of the curative-preventive costs and 15% of the pharmaceutic costs are estimated to be spent on the health damages caused by smoking. In 2009, the Health Insurance Fund had to spend approximately 174.6 billion HUF for health damages including sick leave costs caused by smoking. Working days lost (patients on sick list) as a consequence of smoking decreased the GDP of Hungary by around 95 billion HUF in the same year. Literature suggests that smoking leads to a loss of approximately seven life years. Shortened life span might cause 594.9 billion HUF loss to the Hungarian economy not to mention the economical and emotional loss of the individual families.

"Will accountable care organizations (ACOs) deliver high-quality care at lower costs? Or will their potential market power lead to higher prices and lower quality? ACOs appear in various forms and structures with financial and clinical integration at their core; however, the tools to assess their quality and the incentive structures that will determine their success are still evolving. Both market forces and regulatory structures will determine how these outcomes emerge. This introduction reviews the evidence presented in this special issue to tackle this thorny trade-off. In general the evidence is promising, but the full potential of ACOs to improve the health care delivery system is still uncertain. This introductory review concludes that the current consensus is to let ACOs grow, anticipating that they will make a contribution to improve our poor-quality and high-cost delivery system.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-3149964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26124304/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Based on available epidemiologic, health economic, and international population statistics literature, the cost of epilepsy in Europe was estimated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Europe was defined as the 25 European Union member countries, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. Guidelines for epidemiological studies on epilepsy were used for a case definition. A bottom-up prevalence-based cost-of-illness approach, the societal perspective for including the cost items, and the human capital approach as valuation principle for indirect costs were used. The cost estimates were based on selected studies with common methodology and valuation principles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The estimated prevalence of epilepsy in Europe in 2004 was 4.3-7.8 per 1,000. The estimated total cost of the disease in Europe was euro15.5 billion in 2004, indirect cost being the single most dominant cost category (euro8.6 billion). Direct health care costs were euro2.8 billion, outpatient care comprising the largest part (euro1.3 billion). Direct nonmedical cost was euro4.2 billion. That of antiepileptic drugs was euro400 million. The total cost per case was euro2,000-11,500 and the estimated cost per European inhabitant was euro33.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Epilepsy is a relevant socioeconomic burden at individual, family, health services, and societal level in Europe. The greater proportion of such burden is outside the formal health care sector, antiepileptic drugs representing a smaller proportion. Lack of economic data from several European countries and other methodological limitations make this report an initial estimate of the cost of epilepsy in Europe. Prospective incidence cost-of-illness studies from well-defined populations and common methodology are encouraged.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01251.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18088267/,economics
"Market disciplines and incentives were expected to improve efficiency in the UK National Health Service following the introduction of an 'internal market' in 1991. An exploratory survey of all Health Authorities and Trusts in the UK was undertaken to investigate whether players in the NHS managed market are behaving as economic theory predicts they should. The focus was on how and to what extent marginal costing has been used in the contracting process and on whether in some instances an inappropriate use of marginal costing may be resulting in inappropriate investment decisions. Twenty of 29 responding Health Authorities (69%) and 16 of 39 Trusts (41%) stated that they had considered purchasing/providing services on a marginal-cost basis and all of these led to contracts. Marginal-cost contracting appears to be fairly commonplace and the process does not appear to be causing insurmountable conflicts between players. Most marginal-cost contracts were specifically to meet waiting-list initiative targets. Overall results suggest that economic principles are not being particularly adhered to, with expansion in output rarely being related to available capacity. As increased responsibility for commissioning passes to primary care teams and local health groups, there are lessons for those involved in this more disaggregated approach to service shaping and service delivery.",https://doi.org/10.1258/0951484011912591,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11373994/,economics
"Among health services researchers, an ""economizing model"" of health care has eclipsed two traditional models, ""social conflict"" and ""collective welfare."" The older models emphasized social solidarity and distributive justice, but the newer one focuses on improving efficiency, minimizing risks borne by third-party payers, constraining cost increases, and improving the functioning of markets. This article examines one source of the economizing model, the work of several early and persistently prominent economists of health care, especially Mark Pauly, Martin Feldstein, and Joseph Newhouse and his colleagues at the Rand Corporation. In particular, it explores their role in transforming perceptions of health care from a set of special services into an ordinary commodity, in giving currency to apparently dispassionate as opposed to overtly value-laden analysis, and in according priority, among health services researchers and policy makers, to economists' traditional interest in fostering smoothly functioning markets. It exhibits their principal policy recommendation-income-graduate cost sharing-the sources and character of their modes of analysis, and the character of their influence on policy makers. The article concludes that the supposedly value-free economic analysis of health care rests on a cluster of values that inhibit the expression of social solidarity and the formulation of policies intended to foster distributive justice.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-23-2-215,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9565893/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Mental disorders represent a major contributor to disease burden worldwide. We sought to quantify the national economic burden of mental disorders in China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a prevalence-based, bottom-up approach to estimate the economic costs of mental disorders in 2005-2013 in China. Prevalence data were derived from a national survey. Cost data were derived from the electronic health records of two psychiatric hospitals that consisted of 25,289 outpatients (10%) and inpatients (90%) who were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Cost items included direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total annual costs of mental disorders in China increased from $1,094.8 in 2005 to $3,665.4 in 2013 for individual patients, and from $21.0 billion to $88.8 billion for the whole society. The total costs of mental disorders in 2013 accounted for more than 15% of the total health expenditure in China, and 1.1% of China's gross domestic product. If the needs of the professional care for all patients with mental illnesses were fully met, the potential economic costs would have been almost five times higher than the actual estimated costs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Mental disorders imposed a huge economic burden on individuals and the society in China. A nation-wide strategic action plan for preventing mental disorders and promoting mental health and well-being is in urgent need to reduce the individual and societal costs of mental illnesses.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-016-0839-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27169936/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Despite the many benefits of living donor kidney transplantation, economic consequences can result for donors. We reviewed studies which quantified the direct and indirect costs incurred by living kidney donors, in order to understand the strengths and limitations of existing literature.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We identified relevant studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE and ECONOLIT bibliographic databases, in the Science Citation Index and study reference lists. Any study which reported at least one cost relevant to donors was included. The accuracy of abstracted data was verified by two reviewers and reported in year 2004 US dollars.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-five studies from 12 countries described costs incurred by individuals who donated between the years 1964 and 2003. No study comprehensively quantified all relevant expenses-the sum of select costs considered in one US study averaged Dollars 837 per donor and ranged from Dollars 0 to 28,906. Travel and/or accommodation costs were incurred by 9-99% of donors, and were higher in countries with a larger land mass. Post-discharge analgesics were required by 4-24% of donors, but prescription costs were not reported. Between 14 and 30% of donors incurred costs for lost income, with an average loss of Dollars 3386 in one study from the UK and Dollars 682 in another study from the Netherlands. Costs for dependent care were incurred by 9-44% of donors, while costs for domestic help were incurred by 8% of donors.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Donors incur many types of costs attributable to kidney donation and the total costs are certainly higher than previously reported.

"Sickness funds became the focal point of health insurance reforms in the 1990s. Policy makers expected funds to become more consumer-oriented and more active in managing the provision of health care. This is especially true for two countries in the heart of Europe that, on first view, have many similar institutional characteristics. Both Germany and The Netherlands have introduced competition between sickness funds in the last decade. We present extensive quantitative, as well qualitative, data with regard to the behaviour of consumers after the introduction of free choice between sickness funds. National data was used with regard to contribution rates and member flows and survey data was used to investigate personal motives for actual change and perception of differences between sickness funds. In Germany, contribution rates between sickness funds differ significantly. Accordingly, these differences are the main reason for consumers to switch funds, which occurs on a considerable scale. However, survey data show that other reasons may be important too. In The Netherlands, premium differences are much lower. The same is true for the degree of change. Survey data show that consumers perceive very small differences between sickness funds and do not see much reason for change. Our findings support the claim that the degree of actual changing depends strongly on economic incentives, especially with regard to the extent of financial risk sickness funds have to bear and to the extent premiums or contribution rates can differ. However, the higher the financial risk of individual sickness funds actually is, the higher the incentives for risk selection.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(01)00193-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11965333/,economics
"This study analysed the outstanding homogeneity of the German Diagnosis-Related Groups (G-DRG) using the reduction in variance (R²) of costs. Arbitrary increase in case groups, definition of additional charges and combination of several case groups in one DRG were considered as potential confounders. In 2009, the G-DRG-system offers an outstanding homogeneity with R² of 83.5% in comparison to 2004 with R² of 70.2%. The effect of an arbitrary increase in case groups is negligible. However, a simulation of the other confounders explains three-fourth of the increase in R² between 2004 and 2009. The definition of additional charges attributes in particular to the outstanding homogeneity. The assessment of DRG-systems with R² should be complemented with measures that are independent from a trimming of costs, e.g. relating actual costs with prospective payment. The G-DRGs left medical ground in order to achieve optimal economical homogeneity.",https://doi.org/10.1258/hsmr.2010.010002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21097725/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Cost-effectiveness evidence is increasingly considered in the reimbursement decisions of pharmaceuticals. In some jurisdictions such as the UK and Canada, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit economic evaluations when seeking reimbursement.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      Our objectives were to describe the role of economic evidence in the cancer drug review process in Canada, and to investigate the nature of problems encountered in the review and interpretation of economic evidence used in the process.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective review of cancer drug review meeting minutes and reviewers' comments on pharmacoeconomic studies submitted to the oncology drug review process in Canada.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      We used pharmacoeconomic reviewers' reports and relevant cancer drug review expert advisory committee meeting minutes during the first year of the review process (April 2007 to March 2008).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen economic submissions were reviewed. One-third of the studies had flaws significant enough that the advisory committee could not determine the cost effectiveness of the drugs from the results. The common issues outlined by the reviewers and committee were related to the uncertainty of comparative clinical benefits, quality of life and costs. The reviewers felt that few analyses provided sufficient sensitivity analyses around key variables to assess the robustness of results. Most problems identified by reviewers are simple to fix and do not involve advanced methods.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Canada has a separate review process for making cancer drug funding recommendations, and this process uses both clinical and economic evidence. The committee could not determine the value for money of the drugs from several of the submitted pharmacoeconomic analyses. Transparent analyses and detailed critique of evidence are crucial to the use of economic evidence in reimbursement decisions. Rigorous evaluation is resource intensive and may benefit from a shared drug review process among several jurisdictions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-012-0022-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322588/,economics
"This paper studies short-run cyclical behaviour of public (government and social) and private health expenditure and GDP using both time series and panel data techniques. First, national time series data have been used within a multivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition framework to construct the permanent and cyclical components. The correlation analysis results for the cyclical components suggest that current public health expenditure is pro-cyclical while there is no clear evidence of a correlation between cycles in private health expenditure and in GDP growth. Next, using an instrumental variable method and the generalised method of moments estimator, provincial-level panel data analyses confirm pro-cyclical impacts of government spending on health. The provincial analysis also suggests that private health expenditure in urban China has a pro-cyclical association with GDP growth, but a lack of good instruments makes it difficult to identify a clear causal link between cycles in income growth and private health expenditure. The results suggest two policy recommendations relevant to public health expenditure, in line with China's current health reforms.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23836624/,economics
"With rapid increases in healthcare spending over recent years, health economic evaluation might be thought to be increasing in importance to decision-makers. Such evaluations are designed to inform the efficient management of healthcare resources. However, research into health policy decisions often report, at best, moderate use of economic evaluation information, especially at the local level of administration. Little attention seems to have been given to the question of why economic evaluations have been underused and why they may yield different results in different contexts. There are many barriers to applying economic evaluations in situations which combine complexity with uncertainty. These barriers call for innovative and creative responses to economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. One response is to view economic evaluations in the context of complex adaptive systems theory. Such theory offers a conceptual framework that takes into account contextual factors, multiple input and output, multiple perspectives and uncertainty involved in healthcare interventions. This article illustrates how complexity theory can enrich and broaden policy-makers' understanding of why economic evaluations have not always been as successful as health economists would have hoped. It argues for health economists to emphasise contextual knowledge and relativist understanding of decision contexts rather than seeking more technically sound evidence-based reviews including economic evaluations.",https://doi.org/10.1071/ah11041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22958896/,economics
"We study the strategic relationship between hospital investment and provision of service quality. We use a spatial competition framework and allow investment and quality to be complements or substitutes in patient benefit and provider cost. We assume that each hospital commits to a certain investment before deciding on service quality, and that investment is observable and contractible while quality is observable but not contractible. We show that, under a fixed DRG-pricing system, providers' lack of ability to commit to quality leads to under- or overinvestment, relative to the first-best solution. Underinvestment arises when the price-cost margin is positive, and quality and investments are strategic complements, which has implications for optimal contracting. Differently from the simultaneous-move case, the regulator must complement the payment with one more instrument to address under/overinvestment. We also analyse the welfare effects of different policy options (separate payment for investment, higher per-treatment prices, or DRG-refinement policies).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2022.102588,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35065851/,economics
"Economic analyses are becoming increasingly prevalent in the obstetrics and gynecology literature, and it is essential that clinicians have a basic comprehension of this research methodology. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to economic analysis, in particular cost-effectiveness analysis, and to summarize the basic principles and recently proposed standards for studies using these analytic methods. The fundamental principle of economic analysis is that choices will have to be made between alternative use of resources because there are not unlimited resources to provide all the medical care possible to each individual. These analyses can illustrate the tradeoffs involved in choosing among a variety of clinical interventions to improve health care, and ultimately inform decision making. With a basic understanding of the key concepts of economic analyses, clinicians and health service researchers will be better prepared to critically review these analyses and incorporate them into daily practice.

"Managed care embodies an effort by employers, the insurance industry, and some elements of the medical profession to establish priorities and decide who gets what from the health care system. After a turbulent decade of trial and error, that experiment can be characterized as an economic success but a political failure. The strategy of giving with one hand while taking away with the other, of offering comprehensive benefits while restricting access through utilization review, has infuriated everyone involved. The protagonists of managed care now are in full retreat, broadening physician panels, removing restrictions, and reverting to fee-for-service payment. Governmental entities are avoiding politically volatile initiatives to balance limited resources and unlimited expectations. By default, if not by design, the consumer is emerging as the locus of priority setting in health care. The shift to consumerism is driven by a widespread skepticism of governmental, corporate, and professional dominance; unprecedented economic prosperity that reduces social tolerance for interference with individual autonomy; and the Internet technology revolution, which broadens access to information and facilitates the mass customization of insurance and delivery.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.285.20.2622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11368736/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The importance of pharmacoeconomics and health economics has been augmented. It has the potential to provide evidence to aid in optimal decision-making in the funding of cost-effective medicines and services in Gulf Cooperation Council countries (G.C.C).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the quality and quantity of health economic researches published until the end of 2017 in G.C.C. and to identify the factors that affect the quality of studies.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Studies were included according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quantity was recorded, and the quality was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-nine studies were included. The mean (SD) quality score of all studies was 57.83 (25.05), and a high number of reviewed studies (47%) were evaluated as either poor or extremely poor quality. The factors that affect the quality of studies with statistical significance were, the type and method of economic evaluation, the economic outcome was the objective of the research, author`s background, the perspective of the study, health intervention and source of funding.

"Introduction The purpose of this paper is to examine the size and variability of patients' expenditure in the general dental service (GDS) in Scotland during the recent past.Methods Retrospective analysis of individual patient's expenditure drawn from a 5% random sample of patients treated in the GDS in Scotland between January 1998 and September 2007. Three measures of expenditure per patient were used to assess the size and variability of patients' expenditure in the GDS: patient expenditure per claim, patient expenditure during a 12-month period and patient expenditure during the sample period.Results The size of patients' expenditure on the GDS is small relative to non-NHS insurance arrangements and other components of personal expenditure. There is relatively little variability in patients' GDS expenditure.Conclusions The relatively small size and variability of patient expenditure in the GDS in Scotland suggests that the system of patient charges provides some insurance against the cost of oral healthcare. However, a complete assessment of the insurance properties of the system of patient charges would require several other factors to be accounted for.",https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bdj.2011.575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21779036/,economics
"This paper examines the use of propensity score matching in economic analyses of observational data. Several excellent papers have previously reviewed practical aspects of propensity score estimation and other aspects of the propensity score literature. The purpose of this paper is to compare the conceptual foundation of propensity score models with alternative estimators of treatment effects. References are provided to empirical comparisons among methods that have appeared in the literature. These comparisons are available for a subset of the methods considered in this paper. However, in some cases, no pairwise comparisons of particular methods are yet available, and there are no examples of comparisons across all of the methods surveyed here. Irrespective of the availability of empirical comparisons, the goal of this paper is to provide some intuition about the relative merits of alternative estimators in health economic evaluations where nonlinearity, sample size, availability of pre/post data, heterogeneity, and missing variables can have important implications for choice of methodology. Also considered is the potential combination of propensity score matching with alternative methods such as differences-in-differences and decomposition methods that have not yet appeared in the empirical literature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-013-0075-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24399360/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Pre-eclampsia is a major contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Our objectives in this study are to economically assess, from the payer perspective, routine screening for pre-eclampsia using placental markers -placental protein 13 and placental growth factor - and uterine artery Doppler compared with standard care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A decision model was developed, which progresses through three sequential endpoints, and compares screening with no screening: (1) Pre-eclampsia yes/no: calculation of the incremental cost of pre-eclampsia-case averted; (2) Hospital discharge: calculation of the mean accumulated costs until discharge after delivery; and (3) Offspring death: calculation of the incremental cost per quality of life-adjusted life-year gained by screening. Data used includes: (1) Obstetrical data of 14 500 births; (2) cost data from the Israeli Ministry of Health and the literature; and (3) screening performance and outcome from the literature.
    


          Results:
        
      
      (1) The incremental cost of pre-eclampsia-case averted is $66,949 and $24,723 when the prevalence is 1.7 and 5% respectively. (2) With test cost of $112, the total cost until discharge with/without screening is equal. With pre-eclampsia prevalence of 3%, screening is cheaper. (3) The cost per quality of life-adjusted life-year with screening is $18,919 and < $10,000 with pre-eclampsia prevalence of 1.7 and 3%, respectively.

"Background:
        
      
      An increasing number of technologies are obtaining marketing authorisation based on sparse evidence, which causes growing uncertainty and risk within health technology reimbursement decision making. To ensure that uncertainty is considered and addressed within health technology assessment (HTA) recommendations, uncertainties need to be identified, included in health economic models, and reported.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our objective was to develop the TRansparent Uncertainty ASsessmenT (TRUST) tool for systematically identifying, assessing, and reporting uncertainties in decision models, with the aim of making uncertainties and their impact on cost effectiveness more explicit and transparent.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      TRUST was developed by drawing on the uncertainty and risk assessment literature. To develop and validate this tool, we conducted HTA stakeholder discussion meetings and interviews and applied it in six real-world HTA case studies in the Netherlands and the UK.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The TRUST tool enables the identification and categorisation of uncertainty according to its source (transparency issues, methodology issues, and issues with evidence: imprecision, bias and indirectness, and unavailability) in each model aspect. The source of uncertainty determines the appropriate analysis. The impact of uncertainties on cost effectiveness is also assessed. Stakeholders found using the tool to be feasible and of value for transparent uncertainty assessment. TRUST can be used during model development and/or model review.
    


          Conclusion:

"Whether to include or exclude consumption costs and costs of unrelated illnesses in economic evaluation is not a technical issue which may be answered by reference to individuals alone and the consistency of the treatment of individual costs and benefits. In the context of a publicly funded health service the relevant costs and benefits may differ from those normally included in evaluation studies. Specifically, the social welfare function is likely to exclude benefits which would result in preferential care for wealthier members of society.

"Context:
        
      
      This study investigated the cost variation among neuropsychiatric drugs prevalent in the Indian market with reference to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM, 2015).
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To promote the rational use of medicines through cost variation analysis among drugs for neuropsychiatric disorders enlisted in NLEM and those not included in NLEM (NNLEM).
    


          Study design:
        
      
      This study included drugs used for epilepsy, migraine, psychosis, depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The unit drug cost for the selected strengths of different manufacturers mentioned in the Current Index of Medical Specialities 2016 was used for calculating cost/defined daily dose (DDD).
    


          Statistical analysis:
        
      
      Comparison was done among individual drugs and groups (NLEM and NNLEM) by cost/DDD in terms of interquartile range, percentage cost variation, and cost ratio.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cost variation is wide for neuropsychiatric drugs (maximum, 1724.3% for risperidone in NLEM, and 1780% for olanzapine in NNLEM). The drug-to-cost ratio is the highest (168.8 times) for bipolar disorder and the lowest (9.7 times) for GAD. The NLEM drugs were found to be more economical than the NNLEM drugs among antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and drugs for bipolar disorder; however, the reverse was noted for antimigraine drugs and drugs for GAD. Antipsychotic medications and drugs for OCD in the NLEM group have a wider range than in the NNLEM group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The NLEM group has economical drugs in some disease categories; there is a need to consider the cost effectiveness of all drug categories while revising the NLEM next time and attention should focus on drug price regulation policies to accomplish the goal of rational use of medicines.",https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.241345,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30233018/,economics
"Previous work has found a strong connection between the most recent economic recession and reductions in private health spending. However, the effect of economic downturns on Medicare spending is less clear. In contrast to studies involving earlier time periods, our study found that when the macroeconomy slowed during the Great Recession of 2007-09, so did Medicare spending growth. A small (14 percent) but significant share of the decline in Medicare spending growth from 2009 to 2012 relative to growth from 2004 to 2009 can be attributed to lingering effects of the recession. Absent the economic downturn, Medicare spending would have been $4 billion higher in 2009-12. A major reason for the relatively small impact of the macroeconomy is the relative lack of labor-force participation among people ages sixty-five and older. We estimate that if they had been working at the same rate as the nonelderly before the recession, the effect of the downturn on Medicare spending growth would have been twice as large.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26240251/,economics

As an alternative, I suggest that the government change financial incentives by creating a system of competing health plans in which physicians and consumers can benefit from using resources wisely. Main proposals consist of changed tax laws, Medicare and Medicaid to subsidize individual premium payments by an amount based on financial and predicted medical need, as well as subsidies usable only for premiums in qualified health insurance or delivery plans operating under rules that include periodic open enrollment, community rating by actuarial category, premium rating by market area and a limit on each person's out-of pocket costs. Also, efficient systems should be allowed to pass on the full savings to consumers. Finally, incremental changes should be made in the present system to alter it fundamentally, but gradually and voluntarily.

"The importance of evidence-based health policy is widely acknowledged among health care professionals, patients and politicians. Health care resources available for medical procedures, including pharmaceuticals, are limited all over the world. Economic evaluations help to alleviate the burden of scarce resources by improving the allocative efficiency of health care financing. Reimbursement of new medicines is subject to their cost-effectiveness and affordability in more and more countries. There are three major approaches to calculate the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. Economic analyses alongside pivotal clinical trials are often inconclusive due to the suboptimal collection of economic data and protocol-driven costs. The major limitation of observational naturalistic economic evaluations is the selection bias and that they can be conducted only after registration and reimbursement. Economic modelling is routinely used to predict the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals for reimbursement purposes. Accuracy of cost-effectiveness estimates depends on the quality of input variables; validity of surrogate end points; and appropriateness of modelling assumptions, including model structure, time horizon and sophistication of the model to differentiate clinically and economically meaningful outcomes. These economic evaluation methods are not mutually exclusive; in practice, economic analyses often combine data collection alongside clinical trials or observational studies with modelling. The need for pharmacoeconomic evidence has fundamentally changed the strategic imperatives of research and development (R&D). Therefore, professionals in pharmaceutical R&D have to be familiar with the principles of pharmacoeconomics, including the selection of health policy-relevant comparators, analytical techniques, measurement of health gain by quality-adjusted life-years and strategic pricing of pharmaceuticals.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00550.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20132213/,economics
"In this paper we examine the pricing behaviour of nonprofit health insurers in the Dutch social health insurance market. Since for-profit insurers were not allowed in this market, potential spillover effects from the presence of for-profit insurers on the behaviour of nonprofit insurers were absent. Using a panel data set for all health insurers operating in the Dutch social health insurance market over the period 1996-2004, we estimate a premium model to determine which factors explain the price setting behaviour of nonprofit health insurers. We find that financial stability rather than profit maximisation offers the best explanation for health plan pricing behaviour. In the presence of weak price competition, health insurers did not set premiums to maximize profits. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that regulations on financial reserves are needed to restrict premiums.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2010.12.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295365/,economics
"Liver diseases are one of the main causes of death, and their ever-increasing prevalence is threatening to cause significant damage both to individuals and society as a whole. This damage is especially serious for the economically active population in Korea. From the societal perspective, it is therefore necessary to consider the economic impacts associated with liver diseases, and identify interventions that can reduce the burden of these diseases. The cost-of-illness study is considered to be an essential evaluation technique in health care. By measuring and comparing the economic burdens of diseases to society, such studies can help health-care decision-makers to set up and prioritize health-care policies and interventions. Using economic theories, this paper introduces various study methods that are generally applicable to most disease cases for estimating the costs of illness associated with mortality, morbidity, disability, and other disease characteristics. It also presents concepts and scopes of costs along with different cost categories from different research perspectives in cost estimations.

The data available for projecting changes in surplus were not sufficiently precise to allow an exact statement on whether Johne's-positive operations would have been better or worse off economically, in terms of the value received for producing more milk if they had not been affected by Johne's disease. The changes in producer surplus, based upon eliminating specific epidemiological risk factors for Johne's disease, were disaggregated between Johne's-positive dairy operations exposed to the risk factor and all other US dairy operations.

"For decades, economic evaluation studies, or cost-benefit analyses (CBA), have been a tool for decision support in the use of public funds. Despite this, in the last few years, debates on the inclusion of CBAs in the German health care system have paid little attention to the findings and practical experiences of scientific research. CBAs - especially the QALY - were instead represented a priori as ""unfair"" and ""discriminatory."" Today they have virtually no meaning when it comes to allocation and pricing decisions about publicly funded health services. Of course, CBAs are based on value judgments, which have to be communicated. They can lead to allocations that violate the minimum standards of justice. Here, distributive requirements and criteria are needed and must be developed in an interdisciplinary discourse. However, a general waiver of CBA does not make decisions about the allocation of resources easier, especially since its involvement can contribute to more openness and transparency in the system. Accordingly, for Germany a dual approach is recommended: an interdisciplinary exploration of the methodological foundations of economic evaluation and a consistent application of these in healthcare decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-012-1466-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22526854/,economics
"This paper exploits a natural experiment in the state of California, to show that pro-competitive healthcare policy may have unintended long-term liabilities unless the system as a whole is carefully designed to preserve access to care for the poor. California's Medicaid Reform Act of 1982 increased competition among hospitals in urban areas, with legislation which allowed direction of patients to more efficient providers via selective contracting. This slowed the average rate of hospital cost inflation, and saved the state billions of dollars. The substantial short-term savings have been documented in empirical research, but little attention has been paid to the longer-term effects of the reforms. We find that Medicaid contracts were awarded to more efficient hospitals. The distributional effects post-reform resulted in efficiency gains for most hospitals, but costs escalated for over half of the public hospitals in the sample, as their uncompensated care burdens rose. Public hospitals continued to fail during the period, leaving over half of California's counties without a county hospital by 1990. Because public hospitals provide the vast majority of healthcare for the poor in California, there is reason for concern about erosion of their access to care as an unintended outcome of pro-competitive reforms.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199805)7:3<247::aid-hec319>3.0.co;2-j,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9639337/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      We sought to review the economics literature on enteral nutrition (EN) and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) against the background of an ongoing clinical guideline development.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We searched the Health Economic Evaluations Database, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Enteral vs parenteral nutrition was found to be the most common comparison undertaken. The randomized trial evidence suggests that, in some groups of patients, EN is better in terms of clinical endpoints and/or length of hospital stay. This should translate into a lower mean cost for EN, given the reduced daily cost. These studies should be treated with caution because of their small sample size and poor quality. Costing was often crude and poorly reported, tending to focus on the narrow costs of the nutrition supplements. Only 1 study of a nutrition supplement in the community setting was found.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is some evidence to indicate economic advantages of enteral over parenteral nutrition and of immune-enhancing supplements relative to control diet. There is a lack of well-designed studies taking a broad view of relevant comparators, costs, and outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of different forms of nutrition in different patient groups remains to be established.",https://doi.org/10.1177/014860710603000152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16387900/,economics

"This article describes the fundamental principles of economic assessment of animal health performance in the modem animal production environment. Animal production is a complex system of combined inputs (eg, physical inputs, managerial decision choices) into a production process that produces products valued by society. Perturbations to this system include disease processes and management inefficiencies. Economic valuation of these perturbations must account for the marginal changes in revenues and cost, the time dimensions of occurrence, the inherent risk characteristics of biologic systems, and any opportunity value that exists that allows management to intervene within the process and make economically influencing decisions. It has been recognized that improving animal health can play a major role in achieving efficient and economically rewarding production.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvfa.2005.11.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16517303/,economics
"It has become increasingly popular to carry out cost-effectiveness analyses in economic evaluations of healthcare programmes. Cost-effectiveness analysis is based on the maximisation of the health effects for a given amount of resources. However, many published studies fail to report the results of cost-effectiveness analysis in a way that is consistent with this underlying aim. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the decision rules of cost-effectiveness analysis in an easily accessible way for practitioners in the field. A hypothetical example is used to demonstrate the decision rules of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we also show how to estimate the appropriate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and how to exclude dominated alternatives. It is then shown how fixed budgets or predetermined prices per effectiveness unit can be used as decision rules to maximise health effects and to determine which programmes to implement on the basis of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We hope that the article will contribute towards an increased understanding and application of the appropriate decision rules of cost-effectiveness analysis, so that the results of cost-effectiveness analyses can be interpreted meaningfully by decision makers.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199609020-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10160090/,economics
"We draw from documented characteristics of the biopharmaceutical industry to construct a model where two firms can choose to outsource R&D to an external unit, and/or engage in internal R&D, before competing in a final market. We investigate the distribution of profits among market participants, and the incentives to coordinate outsourcing activities or to integrate R&D and production. Consistent with the empirical evidence, we find that the sign and magnitude of an aggregate measure of direct (inter-firm) and indirect (through the external unit) technological externalities drives the distribution of industry profits, with higher returns to the external unit when involved in development (clinical trials) than in early-stage research (drug discovery). In the latter case, the delinkage of investment incentives from industry value, together with the ability of firms to transfer risks to the external unit, imply a vulnerability of early-stage investors' returns to negative shocks, and the likely abandonment of projects with economic and medical value. We also find that competition in the equity market makes a buyout by one of the two firms more profitable to a research biotech than to a clinical services unit, and can stimulate early-stage investments. However, this long-term incentive can be minimal, notably if the superior efficiency of outsourced operations originates from economies of scope that can hardly be exploited when a firm takes control of the external unit exclusively for itself. R&D outsourcing thus does not always qualify as a relevant pathway to address the declining productivity in innovation that has characterized the industry over several decades.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2019.01.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31158785/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Abuse of prescription opioids [opioid use disorder (OUD), poisoning, and fatal and non-fatal overdose] is a public health and economic challenge that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in the USA and globally.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically review and summarize the health economics literature published over the last 5 years that describes the economic burden of abuse of prescription opioids.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Findings from searches of databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL as well as hand searches of multiple conference abstracts were screened against predefined inclusion criteria to identify studies reporting cost and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) data associated with abuse of prescription opioids.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 49 unique studies were identified. Most of the studies examined direct costs and HRU, which were substantially higher for abusers of prescription opioids than non-abuser controls in several matched cohort analyses (US$20,343-US$28,718 vs US$9716-US$14,079 for mean direct combined annual healthcare costs reported in 6 studies). Although only a small number of studies reported indirect costs, these findings suggest a high societal burden related to productivity losses, absenteeism, morbidity, and mortality among those who abuse opioids. Studies of medication-assisted treatment demonstrated that factors such as adherence, dose, formulation (film or tablet), and relapse during treatment, were associated with direct costs and HRU among treated patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This systematic literature review shows that abuse of prescription opioids is characterized by substantial direct healthcare costs, medical utilization, and related societal costs.

"Two of the best-known economic models of hospital behavior are utilized to examine theoretically the issue of cross-subsidization of hospital costs between public and private-pay patients. It is shown that the existence of public/private hospital-charge differentials does not, in itself, demonstrate that public programs are subsidized by the private sector. This differential is to be expected, whether hospitals are considered to be monopolistic profit maximizers or controlled by physicians. While cost-based hospital reimbursement may be dynamically inefficient, it is shown to have certain static efficiency properties when hospitals provide services to both public and private patients.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-7-4-945,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6341448/,economics

"Evaluations of healthcare interventions, e.g. new drugs or other new treatment strategies, commonly include a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) that is based on the application of health economic (HE) models. As end users, patients are important stakeholders regarding the outcomes of CEAs, yet their knowledge of HE model development and application, or their involvement therein, is absent. This paper considers possible benefits and risks of patient involvement in HE model development and application for modellers and patients. An exploratory review of the literature has been performed on stakeholder-involved modelling in various disciplines. In addition, Dutch patient experts have been interviewed about their experience in, and opinion about, the application of HE models. Patients have little to no knowledge of HE models and are seldom involved in HE model development and application. Benefits of becoming involved would include a greater understanding and possible acceptance by patients of HE model application, improved model validation, and a more direct infusion of patient expertise. Risks would include patient bias and increased costs of modelling. Patient involvement in HE modelling seems to carry several benefits as well as risks. We claim that the benefits may outweigh the risks and that patients should become involved.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-015-0200-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26385585/,economics
"This paper deals with health economic aspects of prevention. After giving a definition of the term prevention, published estimates of the burden of disease attributable to selected risk factors are presented. These estimates suggest that a considerable share of morbidity, mortality and health care costs may be avoided through prevention. Subsequently, the paper describes the methods that can be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of preventive services. Typical problems arise from the necessity to estimate long-term costs and effects, which often requires modeling. A specific problem refers to whether so-called unrelated future health care costs caused by other diseases in life years gained through prevention should be included when calculating the costs of prevention. Economic evaluations of preventive services published in the literature often report very favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. In order to increase the efficiency of health care, more cost-effective preventive services should be developed and used.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00108-007-1994-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18210026/,economics

WHO Global Observatory data on 159 nations with roughly 98% of the world's population were examined. Regime scores had significant, direct and independent associations with each of four measures of health care expenditure. For every unit increment in a nation's regime score toward a more democratic authority structure of governance, we estimated significant (p<0.05) increments in the percent of GDP expended on health care (+0.14%), percent of general government expenditures targeted to health care (+0.25%), total per capita expenditures on health (+34.4Int$) and per capita general government expenditures (+22.4Int$), while controlling for a population's age distribution, life expectancy, health care workforce and system effectiveness and gross national income.

"Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to provide estimates of amounts charged for dental care during 1996 for the US adult population and its major sociodemographic subgroups, and to evaluate whether charges had increased since 1987.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used data from the 1996 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey and report results for 12,931 adults aged 19-64 years. For comparison with previously published charges, we converted 1987 charges to their 1996 ""constant dollar"" value to control for inflation. Data were analyzed using SUDAAN and the results can be generalized to the US adult population.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 1996, 43.7 percent (95% CI=42.7%, 44.6%) of the US population incurred dental care charges, which did not differ significantly from the 1987 estimate of 44.5 percent. In 1996, mean per capita charge for dental care was 182 dollars (95% CI=171 dollars, 192 dollars), which did not differ significantly from the inflation-adjusted 1987 estimate of 174 dollars. The average charge per patient who incurred charges in 1996 was 416 dollars (95% CI=394 dollars, 438 dollars), which was only 7 percent greater than the inflation-adjusted 1987 estimate of 389 dollars (P=.08). Sociodemographic variations were observed in per capita charges, but were less apparent in mean charge per patient who incurred charges.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      During a period when economic growth and other market forces were expected to increase delivery of dental services, there was little or no change in percentage of US adults incurring charges or in mean per capita charges.

The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted.

The risk of large medical expenditures can be substantial for elderly individuals and is only partially mitigated by access to health insurance. The presence of deductibles, copayments, and other cost-sharing mechanisms implies that medical spending risk can be viewed as an undiversifiable background risk. Economic theory suggests that increases in background risk reduce the optimal financial risk that an individual or household is willing to bear (Pratt and Zeckhauser 1987; Elmendorf and Kimball 2000). In this study, we evaluate this hypothesis by estimating the impact of the introduction of the Medicare Part D program, which significantly reduced prescription drug spending risk for seniors, on portfolio choice.",https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.p20161125,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29547247/,economics

"To compete more effectively for resources, it is increasingly important for infection control practitioners to estimate the costs of nosocomial infections and the amount of money their infection control programs save the hospital. Studies on costs should estimate both extra length of stay and extra costs attributable to infectious complications. Cost estimates should either adjust charges by a cost to charge ratio, which is relatively easy, or estimate hospital costs directly by detailed cost-accounting, which is comparatively more difficult. If there is insufficient time to measure costs concurrently in every infected patient, comparative studies can be done by comparing infected and uninfected patients matched on characteristics that control for the preexisting differences between them. Diagnosis-related groups and the number of diagnoses appear to be useful matching variables because they are strongly associated with both nosocomial infection and length of stay. The final results should be expressed as either potential or actual savings to the hospital, depending on whether significant reductions in nosocomial infection rates have been achieved.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9343(91)90341-t,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1928186/,economics

A literature search was conducted to identify health economic articles pertaining to Nigeria. Two reviewers independently scored each article in the final sample using a data collection form designed for the study. A total of 44 studies investigating a wide variety of diseases were included in the review. These articles were published in 34 different journals, mostly based outside of Nigeria, between 1988 and 2009. On average, each article was written by four authors. Most first authors had medical/clinical affiliations and resided in Nigeria at the time of publication of the study. Based on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 indicating the highest quality, the mean quality score for all studies was 7.29 (SD 1.21) and 59% of the articles were of fair quality (score 5-7); 5% were of even lower quality. The quality of articles was statistically significantly (p < or = 0.05) related to the country of residence of the primary author (non-Nigeria = higher), country of the journal (non-Nigeria = higher), primary objective of the study (economic analysis = higher) and type of economic analysis conducted (economic evaluations higher than cost studies).

The share of saving on GDP has a concave shape with respect to per capita GDP, whereas the share of health spending on GDP increases more than proportionally with respect to per capita GDP. The ratio of saving to spending is nonlinear with respect to income, i.e. first increasing and then decreasing. This ratio, in the proposed model, is equal to the ratio between the elasticity of the utility function with respect to saving and the elasticity of the utility function with respect to health.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-009-0183-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19798525/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      To understand the long-term economic implications of key pathways for financing a medical school education.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The authors calculated the net present value (NPV) of cash flow over a 30-year career for a 2013 matriculant associated with (1) self-financing, (2) federally guaranteed loans, (3) the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, (4) the National Health Service Corps, (5) the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program, and (6) matriculation at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. They calculated the NPV for students pursuing one of four specialties in two cities with divergent tax policies. Borrowers were assumed to have a median level of debt ($180,000), and conservative projections of inflation, discount rates, and income growth were employed. Sensitivity analyses examined different discount and income growth rates, alternative repayment strategies, and various lengths of public-sector service by scholarship recipients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For those wealthy enough to pay cash or fortunate enough to secure a no-strings scholarship, self-financing produced the highest NPV in almost every scenario. Borrowers start practice $300,000 to $400,000 behind their peers who secure a national service scholarship, but those who enter a highly paid specialty, such as orthopedic surgery, overtake their national service counterparts 4 to 11 years after residency. Those in lower-paid specialties take much longer. Borrowers who enter primary care never close the gap.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Over time, the value of a medical degree offsets the high up-front cost. Debt avoidance confers substantial economic benefits, particularly for students interested in primary care.",https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000001572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28121649/,economics
"While the past decade has seen the development of multiple new interventions to diagnose and treat cancer, as well as to improve the quality of life for cancer patients, many of these interventions have substantial costs. This has resulted in increased scrutiny of the costs of care for cancer, as well as the costs relative to the benefits for cancer treatments. It is important for oncologists and other members of the cancer community to consider and understand how economic evaluations of cancer interventions are performed and to be able to use and critique these evaluations. This review discusses the components, main types, and analytic issues of health economic evaluations using studies of cancer interventions as examples. We also highlight limitations of these economic evaluations and discuss why members of the cancer community should care about economic analyses.",https://doi.org/10.3322/ca.2008.0008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18596196/,economics
"This article identifies the effects of the 1997-98 East Asian economic crisis on health care use and health status in Indonesia. The article places the findings in the context of a framework showing the complex cause and effect relationships underlying the effects of economic downturns on health and health care. The results are based on primary analysis of Indonesian household survey data and review of a wide range of sources from the Indonesian government and international organizations. Comparisons are drawn with the effects of the crisis in Thailand. The devaluation of the Indonesian currency, the Rupiah, led to inflation and reduced real public expenditures on health. Households' expenditures on health also decreased, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of overall spending. Self-reported morbidity increased sharply from 1997 to 1998 in both rural and urban areas of Indonesia. The crisis led to a substantial reduction in health service utilization during the same time period, as the proportion of household survey respondents reporting an illness or injury that sought care from a modern health care provider declined by 25%. In contrast to Indonesia, health care utilization in Thailand actually increased during the crisis, corresponding to expansion in health insurance coverage. The results suggest that social protection programmes play a critical role in protecting populations against the adverse effects of economic downturns on health and health care.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czg022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12740322/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) makes recommendations on the reimbursement of new drugs utilizing an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) threshold range that has been in use since 2004 and has remained unchanged.
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      To model how the NICE cost-effectiveness thresholds would vary if inflation was accounted for and their potential effects on appraisal outcomes, all single technology appraisal (STA) recommendations published in 2019 were identified. The outcome and most plausible ICERs were then evaluated against thresholds, after taking inflation into account.
    


          Results:
        
      
      41 STAs with base-case ICERs were identified. For general STAs, 46% of ICERs were ≤£20,000/QALY, 27% were £20,000-£30,000/QALY and 27% >£30,000/QALY. Cumulatively, there was a 43% decrease in the purchasing power of the pound from 2004 to 2019 due to inflation. To compensate, the NICE ICER threshold would have to increase to £28,584-£42,876/QALY. Using inflation-adjusted thresholds led to an absolute increase of 18% and 12% of STAs whose ICERs fell below the lower and upper bounds of this threshold range, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      By not adjusting for inflation, the NICE ICER thresholds have declined in real terms. Whether ICER thresholds should be dynamic to reflect factors like inflation requires further research.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1929926,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33980118/,economics
"This study examined the regional inequity in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) financing in Jiangsu, China. Counties were classified into three categories according to socio-economic development level: South Jiangsu, Middle Jiangsu and North Jiangsu. Five counties (Changshu, Danyang, Gaoyou, Jiangyan and Ganyu) were selected on the basis of the following criteria: (i) NCMS had been implemented before 2005; (ii) county governments were willing and able to collaborate with the research team; and (iii) counties had different socio-economic development status representing the low, medium and high level of socio-economic development in Jiangsu. As shown in this study, local governments in Jiangsu took the major NCMS financing responsibilities (75.2% in 2009), and local governments (county and lower) subsidies ranged from 220 RMB per capita in South Jiangsu to 18 RMB per capita in North Jiangsu in 2009, with a larger contribution (73.3%) in South than that in Middle (40.0%) and North Jiangsu (18.0%). For achieving more equity in NCMS financing and carrying NCMS forward, we propose that provincial and municipal governments should increase their contribution to NCMS for balancing the regional inequity in subsidies from county and lower-level governments, and the risk pool of NCMS should be promoted to a higher level (e.g., provincial).",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23296711/,economics
"This paper reviews the concept of optimal quality in medical care from an economic viewpoint. It also provides some data on recent trends in competition in the health care sector. Economically optimal quality reflects a tradeoff of marginal benefits against (minimized) marginal cost. Actual quality may be suboptimal either because of technical inefficiency in the production of quality or because consumers fail to make proper choices. In concept, competition, if supplemented by adequate information, can help. Overall competition in the hospital industry has declined modestly in recent years, but competition in markets for more generously reimbursed specific services, such as coronary artery bypass grafting, has increased.",https://doi.org/10.1023/b:ihfe.0000032419.89581.04,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15211102/,economics
"This article discusses pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies in European countries with regard to their ability to ensure affordable access to medicines. A frequently applied pricing policy is external price referencing. While it provides some benchmark for policy-makers and has been shown to be able to generate savings, it may also contribute to delay in product launch in countries where medicine prices are low. Value-based pricing has been proposed as a policy that promotes access while rewarding useful innovation; however, implementing it has proven quite challenging. For high-priced medicines, managed-entry agreements are increasingly used. These agreements allow policy-makers to manage uncertainty and obtain lower prices. They can also facilitate earlier market access in case of limited evidence about added therapeutic value of the medicine. However, these agreements raise transparency concerns due to the confidentiality clause. Tendering as used in the hospital and offpatent outpatient sectors has been proven to reduce medicine prices but it requires a robust framework and appropriate design with clear strategic goals in order to prevent shortages. These pricing and reimbursement policies are supplemented by the widespread use of Health Technology Assessment to inform decision-making, and by strategies to improve the uptake of generics, and also biosimilars. While European countries have been implementing a set of policy options, there is a lack of thorough impact assessments of several pricing and reimbursement policies on affordable access. Increased cooperation between authorities, experience sharing and improving transparency on price information, including the disclosure of confidential discounts, are opportunities to address current challenges.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-016-0300-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28063134/,economics
"At least nine different criteria are relevant for decisions about public spending for health care. These include economic efficiency criteria (public goods, externalities, catastrophic cost, and cost-effectiveness), ethical reasons (poverty, horizontal and vertical equity, and the rule of rescue), and political considerations (especially demands by the populace). Sometimes one criterion should be examined before another one is considered; that is, they are hierarchically related. Sometimes two criteria will not be compatible but will conflict, forcing difficult choices--particularly between efficiency and equity. Properly thought-out choices of which health care interventions to finance with public funds therefore depend not only on looking at all these criteria, but also on treating them in the appropriate sequence and taking account of their possible inconsistencies. Public funds should finance public and semi-public goods that are cost-effective and for which demand is inadequate; cost-effective interventions that preferentially benefit the poor; and catastrophically costly care, when contributory insurance will not work or there are good reasons to finance insurance publicly.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(99)00024-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10538919/,economics
"This paper deals with the environmentally important issue regarding how best to motivate citizens to reduce their individual waste production. The paper discusses the pros and cons of the various financial incentives incorporated into the waste charging mechanism, pay-as-you-throw (PAYT). Pay-as-you-throw breaks with the tradition of paying for waste services through general blanket taxes or levies in the form of flat rates in that households are required to pay individually adjusted fees in the same way as water and electricity bills are calculated on an individual consumption basis. This difference is achieved through the interplay of three principal components which mark the technical implementation of PAYT: identification as a vehicle to attain accountability, measurement of the generated waste and/or corresponding services, and unit pricing as the basis for individual charges proportional to the extent of the obtained services. However, any motivating factor for inducing citizens to dispose of their recyclable discards and residual waste must be supported by a well developed collection infrastructure, good media information and an appropriate, transparent charging policy. Of particular importance is the use of a multi-tiered charge model, i.e., the charging of a fixed minimum fee plus certain variable components payable in respect of the service structure. The introduction of a basic charge, albeit reducing the intensity of the incentives created by the PAYT system, ensures that certain fixed costs for the provision of waste services will be covered independently from the actual waste developments and, at the same time, minimises the temptation to attempt to bypass the system. Such an arrangement for the waste charges neither contradicts the principle of pay-as-you-throw nor does it impair the waste diversion for which it is implemented. Waste statistics and figures representing the waste charging situation in Germany indicate that there is a relatively good correlation between the level of recycling and the amount of perceived financial motivation provided by PAYT. Waste stream developments in areas using such charging schemes generally suggest that the reduction goals are being achieved. Single figures on decreasing quantities of collected residual waste, however, say little about the actual efficiency of differentiated waste charging models and deliver little in the way of reasoned explanation as to why the diffusion of variable rate pricing is progressing painstakingly slowly. To evaluate the success, feasibility and problems of PAYT schemes, one needs to consider the various ways for technically implementing this approach in practice, and must take a broader look into the wide spectrum of available waste services and into more factors that influence their efficiency and acceptance. Urban structure settings assume a particular importance here as do the specific goals of social policy which, among others, are reflected in the charging mechanisms applied. Practical experience, however, shows that solutions can be found which allow most of the concerns and area specifics to be accommodated and waste streams to be influenced in the desired way. Aside from this, positive effects as to waste collection efficiency can also be achieved, which contribute towards long-term environmental improvements and countervail the incremental costs of implementing PAYT.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2008.03.032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18829291/,economics

Such ""direct price discrimination"" is feasible only in imperfectly competitive settings. Using a proprietary national database of health plans offered by a sample of large, multisite firms from 1998–2005, I find firms with positive profit shocks subsequently face higher premium growth, even for the same health plans. Moreover, within a given firm, those sites located in concentrated insurance markets experience the greatest premium increases.

"The burden of cancer in the worldwide context continues to grow, as incidence and mortality increase each year. Regardless of where they live, a significant proportion of cancer patients at all stages of the disease trajectory will suffer social, emotional and psychological morbidity as a result of their diagnosis and treatment. Psychosocial interventions have proven efficacious in helping patients and families overcome many of the challenges that arise consequent to a cancer diagnosis. Addressing psychosocial needs is an essential aspect of any model of adequate cancer care, however it may also prove to be a cornerstone in efforts to extend the reach of cost-effective cancer treatment to meet the growing global need. In order to set the stage for discussion of economic issues, this paper first briefly reviews the literature detailing the extent of distress and the efficacy of psychosocial treatments for cancer patients. This is followed by a summary of terminology and costing concepts in the economic evaluation of psychosocial treatments, and a review of the literature on medical cost offset in mental health, other medical populations, and in cancer patients. The literature clearly supports the notion that psychosocial interventions are not only effective, but also economical. Conclusions support adding costing data into evaluations of the efficacy of psychosocial treatments in order to detail the often present but usually overlooked long-term cost savings that may be accrued to overburdened health-care systems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.832,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15578622/,economics

"To investigate whether the value of the same drug is evaluated differently across jurisdictions, publicly available reimbursement recommendation data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA, Korea) from January 2007 until July 2012 were compared with reimbursement recommendation data from the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee (PBAC) of Australia, and the Common Drug Review (CDR) and the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug review (pCODR) of Canada. The most recent guidelines from the three agencies regarding the recommended methods of economic evaluation and comparator selection were also compared. During the observation period, 25 products were evaluated by all three countries. No significant differences in the comparator(s)' selection or methods of economic evaluation were found, but the CDR was significantly less likely to positively recommend products compared with the other agencies (p=0.023). The agreement between agencies on selected comparator(s) was moderate to significant (kappa statistics=0.590-0.669), whereas the reimbursement decisions (kappa statistics=0.042-0.296) and the methods of economic evaluation (kappa statistics=0.138-0.525) showed slight to fair agreement.

"Context:
        
      
      Hospital cost shifting--charging private payers more in response to shortfalls in public payments--has long been part of the debate over health care policy. Despite the abundance of theoretical and empirical literature on the subject, it has not been critically reviewed and interpreted since Morrisey did so nearly fifteen years ago. Much has changed since then, in both empirical technique and the health care landscape. This article examines the theoretical and empirical literature on cost shifting since 1996, synthesizes the predominant findings, suggests their implications for the future of health care costs, and puts them in the current policy context.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The relevant literature was identified by database search. Papers describing policies were considered first, since policy shapes the health care market in which cost shifting may or may not occur. Theoretical works were examined second, as theory provides hypotheses and structure for empirical work. The empirical literature was analyzed last in the context of the policy environment and in light of theoretical implications for appropriate econometric specification.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Most of the analyses and commentary based on descriptive, industry-wide hospital payment-to-cost margins by payer provide a false impression that cost shifting is a large and pervasive phenomenon. More careful theoretical and empirical examinations suggest that cost shifting can and has occurred, but usually at a relatively low rate. Margin changes also are strongly influenced by the evolution of hospital and health plan market structures and changes in underlying costs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Policymakers should view with a degree of skepticism most hospital and insurance industry claims of inevitable, large-scale cost shifting. Although some cost shifting may result from changes in public payment policy, it is just one of many possible effects. Moreover, changes in the balance of market power between hospitals and health care plans also significantly affect private prices. Since they may increase hospitals' market power, provisions of the new health reform law that may encourage greater provider integration and consolidation should be implemented with caution.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00621.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21418314/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to identify the methods used to determine the value of informal care provided to people living with dementia and to estimate the average hourly unit cost by valuation method.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search in MEDLINE Complete, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EconLit, EMBASE and NHS Economic Evaluation Database was undertaken. Following the screening of title, abstract, and full text, characteristics of eligible studies were extracted systematically and analyzed descriptively. The corresponding hourly cost estimates were converted into 2018 US dollars based on purchasing power parities for gross domestic product.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total number of 111 articles were included in this review from 3106 post-deduplication records. Three main valuation methodologies were identified: the replacement cost method (n = 50), the opportunity cost approach (n = 36), and the stated preference method based on willingness to pay (n = 3), with 16 studies using multiple methods and 6 studies not specifying the valuation method. The amount of informal care increased as the condition of dementia progressed, which was reflected in the cost of informal care. The average hourly unit cost used to value informal care was US $16.78 (SD = US $12.11). Although the unit cost was approximately US $15 per hour when using the opportunity cost method and US $14 when using the stated preference method, the highest unit cost was obtained when using the replacement cost method (US $18.37, SD = US $13.12).
    


          Conclusions:

"The United States is one of the few high-income countries not to apply economic evaluation routinely to health care decision making on a national level, yet it excels at spending least efficiently on health care. In the interest of continuing to develop new solutions to curb spending on health care and reduce waste in the United States, perhaps now is an important moment to reconsider the benefits of economic evaluation and the barriers that must be overcome to have it emerge as a solution for health care institutions and the patients they serve. This article offers several distinct considerations to make economic evaluation methods (such as cost-effectiveness analysis) an effective component of value-based decision making in the United States. These considerations include overcoming the barriers presented by opportunity costs, spending on health care services versus biomedical technologies, phasing out low-value care, using value of information to prioritize resources, and determining what to do with the quality-adjusted life-year. These issues need to be addressed to achieve a collective purpose for economic evaluation at state and national levels.",https://doi.org/10.7326/m20-1234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32986487/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Is existing provision of health services in Europe affordable during the recession or could cuts damage economic growth? This debate centres on whether government spending has positive or negative effects on economic growth. In this study, we evaluate the economic effects of alternative types of government spending by estimating ""fiscal multipliers"" (the return on investment for each $1 dollar of government spending).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using cross-national fixed effects models covering 25 EU countries from 1995 to 2010, we quantified fiscal multipliers both before and during the recession that began in 2008.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that the multiplier for total government spending was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.37 to 1.86), but there was marked heterogeneity across types of spending. The fiscal multipliers ranged from -9.8 for defence (95% CI: -16.7 to -3.0) to 4.3 for health (95% CI: 2.5 to 6.1). These differences appear to be explained by varying degrees of absorption of government spending into the domestic economy. Defence was linked to significantly greater trade deficits (β = -7.58, p=0.017), whereas health and education had no effect on trade deficits (peducation=0.62; phealth= 0.33).

"Background:
        
      
      An increase in the number of Indigenous homeless persons in Cairns, Northern Australia, prompted the Queensland Police Service (QPS) to commence a pilot 'Return to Country' (R2C) program. The program was designed to assist homeless people who were voluntarily seeking to return to their home communities. This study assesses the costs of running the program and evaluates its net economic impact.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective uncontrolled cost, cost-effectiveness and cost-offset analyses were undertaken from a societal perspective. All costs were expressed in 2014 AU$.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The R2C program successfully assisted 140 participants to return home, reducing the prevalence of homelessness in the regional center by 9.6%. The total program cost was estimated as AU$ 135,831 or AU$ 970 per participant. The economic analysis indicated that R2C was value for money, potentially saving AU$ 2,714,460. Limitations of the study included retrospective data collection and no established alternative comparison group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      R2C is a relatively simple, minimal cost program, which can be utilized by policy makers to offer one solution to homelessness. This economic evaluation informs the QPS of the effects of the R2C program in order to guide further program initiatives. The R2C model may be applied to assist temporarily stranded Indigenous people in other locations within Australia or internationally to return home.

"Long-term psychoanalytic treatment is perceived as an expensive ambulatory treatment for mental illnesses. However, there are indications that psychoanalytic treatment can result in cost savings in the long term. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term psychoanalytic treatment on healthcare utilization and work impairment and calculated the associated societal costs. We assessed healthcare utilization and work impairment of patients before, during, and after long-term psychoanalytic treatment (N=231). Our results show that the difference in total costs associated with healthcare utilization and work impairment between pre- and post-treatment was euro2444 (U.S.$3070 using average exchange rates for 2006, the year for which these data were calculated) per person per year. Two years after treatment termination, these cost savings had increased to euro3632 ($4563) per person per year. This indicates that we can expect decreased consumption of medical care and higher work productivity right after psychoanalytic treatment, but also that longterm psychoanalytic treatment can generate economical benefits in the long run. However, we cannot conclude that all invested costs will be earned back eventually.

      Recent studies have found that when investigators have financial relationships with pharmaceutical or product manufacturers, they are less likely to criticize the safety or efficacy of these agents. The effects of health economics research on pharmaceutical company revenue make drug investigations potentially vulnerable to this bias.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether there is an association between pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and economic assessment of oncology drugs.
    


          Design:
        
      
      MEDLINE and HealthSTAR databases (1988-1998) were searched for original English-language research articles of cost or cost-effectiveness analyses of 6 oncology drugs in 3 new drug categories (hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors, serotonin antagonist antiemetics, and taxanes), yielding 44 eligible articles. Two investigators independently abstracted each article based on specific criteria.
    


          Main outcome measure:
        
      
      Relationships between funding source and (1) qualitative cost assessment (favorable, neutral, or unfavorable) and (2) qualitative conclusions that overstated quantitative results.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Pharmaceutical company-sponsored studies were less likely than nonprofit-sponsored studies to report unfavorable qualitative conclusions (1/20 [5%] vs 9/24 [38%]; P = .04), whereas overstatements of quantitative results were not significantly different in pharmaceutical company-sponsored (6/20 [30%]) vs nonprofit-sponsored (3/24 [13%]) studies (P = .26).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although we did not identify bias in individual studies, these findings indicate that pharmaceutical company sponsorship of economic analyses is associated with reduced likelihood of reporting unfavorable results.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.282.15.1453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10535436/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to provide an up-to-date description as well as comparative analysis of the national characteristics of pharmaceutical external price referencing (EPR) in Europe.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Review of the country-specific PPRI (Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Information) Pharma Profiles written by representatives of the PPRI Network. The Profiles were analysed according to predefined criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 28 analysed European countries 24 applied EPR in 2010. The majority of countries have statutory rules to implement EPR. Most countries had less than 10 countries in their reference baskets. Higher income countries tend to include higher income countries in their basket, whereas lower income countries refer to lower income countries. Taking the average price of all countries in the basket as the basis to calculate the national price was the most common strategy (n=8). The methodology of EPR has changed in most European countries over the past 10 years (n=19).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      EPR is a widely used pricing policy in Europe and is still actively used as well as adjusted by national authorities. However, we still see room for improvement by implementing more detailed legislations in terms of the revision of prices and by identifying alternative countries in case a product is not on the market. We also see the need for formal information sharing (e.g. congresses dedicated to pricing strategies and systems) with other public pricing authorities to learn about the different EPR methodologies as well as the national experiences. These congresses might also give room to better understand national pricing methods including discussions on possible limitations of these pricing methods.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.09.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22014843/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      There is a growing body of population survey data on national subjective well-being which allows comparisons across countries and across periods. Key issues in this work are as follows. Can response to questions on well-being be meaningfully compared across countries and periods? What social conditions are associated with greater well-being both between countries and across periods? Are there lessons for how global well-being might be improved? This review aims to give an overview of this area and its relevance to psychiatric epidemiology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic searches of the literature were carried out using eight academic databases between August 2012 and January 2013.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Subjective well-being involves multiple components, including cognitive evaluation of satisfaction with life and emotional state, and these are separable from mental ill health. Although there are difficulties in measuring subjective well-being in comparable ways cross-culturally, there is sufficient evidence of validity to make comparisons meaningful. The subjective well-being of nations increases with income per capita, but gains are smaller in higher-income countries. Other national factors that affect well-being include income inequality, social welfare, individualism, democracy and freedom, social capital and physical health.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economic growth of lower-income nations will improve global subjective well-being. However, this needs to be sustainable or it will reduce the well-being of future generations. Higher-income nations need to focus on other determinants of well-being. Research on cross-national well-being suggests a number of directions that may be profitably pursued in psychiatric epidemiology.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyt188,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24585736/,economics
"Both Medicare and Medicaid are reducing payments to hospitals, and there is widespread concern that hospitals may respond by increasing prices to privately insured patients. Theoretical models of hospital behaviour have ambiguous predictions as to whether, and under what circumstances, hospitals will shift costs to private payers. This paper extends previous theoretical models and then tests empirically using data from California for the 1983-1991 period, a time of increasingly intense price competition. Hospitals did increase their prices to private payers in response to reductions in Medicare rates; they had far smaller and generally insignificant responses to changes in Medicaid reimbursement. Hospital ownership and the competitiveness of the hospital market both affected this behaviour, but there was no significant change over time. The results suggest the need to broaden our models of hospital behaviour to 'embed' them in their local markets.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(200004)9:3<211::aid-hec508>3.0.co;2-k,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10790700/,economics
"In the past 20 years, there has been increasing recognition of the need to consider cost in medical decision making. This period has seen an explosion in the number of economic evaluations appearing in the medical literature. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an objective systematic technique for comparing alternative health care strategies on both cost and effectiveness simultaneously. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to inform medical decision makers in the establishment of clinical practice guidelines and in the setting of health policy. Cost-effectiveness analysis is a state-of-the-art research tool with its own terminology and methods. It is critical that radiologists become familiar with the concepts and procedures of cost-effectiveness analysis so they can properly evaluate cost-effectiveness analysis studies and be more knowledgeable participants in the health care decision-making process.

"The pricing and accessibility of patent-protected drugs in low- and middle-income countries is a contentious issue in the global context. But questions about price have little meaning if a drug is not available for purchase, and the extent to which patent policy affects when (and if) new drugs become available in these countries has largely been overlooked. We examined data on the sales of 184 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 2000 and 2009. We found that 50 percent of those 184 drugs went on sale in India only after lags of more than five years from their first worldwide introduction. More than half of the drugs that became newly available in India during the study period were produced and sold by multiple manufacturers in the country within one year of their introduction. The presence of multiple manufacturers indicates sharp competition and weak patent protection--factors that are disincentives to manufacturers to incur the costs of gaining access to the market. We conclude that modest patent and regulatory reform could bring the faster availability of a wider range of new drugs in India with limited impact on prices--a trade-off that merits greater policy attention.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.1307,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25201661/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Extensive empirical and theoretical studies have been devoted to analyzing the relationship between tobacco and income. The price and income elasticities of demand for cigarette consumption are the main focus of studies in this body of literature. However, few empirical studies exist that analyze how economic growth affects the cigarette market, and no one has studied the effects of economic expansions and recessions. Spain, as in the other countries of the European Union, has suffered a strong recession since 2008. Therefore, this article aims to detect if income elasticity takes different values in economic growth and recession and, in addition, to check whether price elasticity in Spain is consistent with previous studies.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      This is an observational epidemiological study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this article, the price and income elasticities of demand for cigarette consumption are measured for the Spanish cigarette market using time series data from 1957 to 2016 and by applying a non-linear autoregressive dynamics lag model. The novel specification proposed in this study is the determination of the possible effects of asymmetries in the economic shocks on cigarette consumption.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our results reveal that cigarette consumption maintains a notable asymmetric relationship. In particular, our results show that in expansion shocks, cigarette consumption increases (a 10% economic growth is associated with a 4.05% increase in cigarette consumption), whereas in recession shocks, cigarette consumption decreases dramatically, with a more pronounced pattern in recession phases than in expansion phases (a 10% economic decline is associated with a 58.16% decrease in cigarette consumption). On the other hand, price elasticity maintains the same behavior shown in the previous literature (a 10% price increase is associated with a 2% decrease in cigarette consumption).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Higher cigarette prices are associated with decreased smoking. In addition, the economic recession helps in decreasing cigarette consumption. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that tax authorities have our results in mind before establishing health policies. If the authorities do not, it is possible that they will not obtain the expected results in terms of decreased tobacco consumption.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.059,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32707470/,economics
"Since the social sick funds have only limited amounts of money at their disposal, whereas the pharmaceutical market is constantly growing, thorough evaluations have to be undertaken how contributions are to be spent to get adequate value for money and especially to gain utmost benefit for the patients. When deciding on whether a pharmaceutical is listed in the Code of Reimbursement or not, pharmacoeconomic studies are obligatory in two cases: for real innovations with substantial therapeutic benefit and for applications for inclusion in the Yellow Box, when there are no alternatives listed in the Yellow Box. On the basis of the pharmacoeconomic study a comprehensible and justifiable cost/use relation of the pharmaceutical applied for should be proven in comparison with therapeutic alternatives in Austria. However, a pharmacoeconomic study is always only one aspect among others deciding on reimbursement and price. Even though the pharmaceutical applied for is not included in the Code of Reimbursement, reimbursement is possible in special cases if there is no adequate pharmaceutical listed in the Code of Reimbursement and the pharmaceutical is absolutely needed for therapeutic reasons. In these cases prior approval from a chief medical officer is required. Pharmacoeconomic studies for the purpose of section sign 25 of the Rules of Procedure for publishing the Code of Reimbursement (VO-EKO) must meet the following requirements: From a methodical point of view both cost-effectiveness analyses and--in justified cases--cost-utility analyses may be used. Due to required accuracy and traceability incremental analyses are preferred. Medical and economic data underlying the pharmacoeconomic study have to show a high degree of validity and evidence. The perspective to be taken is that of the Austrian Health Insurance. When determining the therapeutic alternatives, the most frequent indication, the most purposeful medical dosage and the main group of affected patients have to be considered. Hereby the order ""Green Box-Yellow Box-Red Box"" has to be taken into account. The direct costs of the obligatory benefits of the social insurance institutions of medical treatment (medical assistance, drugs, substitute assistance), institutional care (based on LKF points) and the medical measures of rehabilitation are to be set. Due to required transparency and traceability quantity and cost structure have to be listed separately. Prices of single items and resource usage in form of units of measurement have to be stated. Studies performed in other countries than Austria may be subject to different health care systems, general conditions, therapeutic alternatives and costs and have therefore to be adapted to Austrian conditions. It must not be disregarded that pharmacoeconomics as any other science comprises different opinions and basic approaches and that pharmacoeconomics is making progress all the time. However, considering their limitations with regard to the interpretation of the results, pharmacoeconomic studies are a key factor for assessing new pharmaceuticals and represent an important contribution to reimbursement and price decisions in Austria.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10354-006-0357-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17211765/,economics
"Studies on global health and development suggest that there is a strong correlation between the burden of disease and a country's level of income. Poorer countries tend to suffer more deaths from preventable causes such as communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions, compared with high-income countries. In low-income countries, the government health expenditure share in the general government budget is low and out-of-pocket payments for healthcare relatively high. They also rely heavily on external resources for health funding, yet sustainability of external resource flows is not guaranteed. This article explores increasing public healthcare funding from domestic resources mobilization, and evaluates the impact of measures to achieve this on sectoral growth and poverty reduction rates in Uganda using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. This article shows that increasing the government health budget share, facilitates expanded healthcare services, improved population health, higher sectoral growth and reduced poverty. The agricultural sector is predicted to post the highest growth when compared with services and industry sectors under both domestic taxation and aid funding scenarios, while national poverty is predicted to decline from 31 to 12% of the population by 2020. This article demonstrates that the most effective measure is to frontload investment in healthcare and generate additional domestic funding for health from a household tax earmarked for health.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czx125,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092033/,economics
"Over the past decade, coronary stenting has emerged as the dominant form of percutaneous coronary revascularization.

In this article, we summarize current evidence on the economic impact of restenosis and explore the potential benefits and economic outcomes of DES. In addition to examining the long-term costs of this promising technology, we consider the potential cost-effectiveness of DES from a health care system perspective and the impact of specific patient, lesion, and provider characteristics on these parameters.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2003.11.020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14975456/,economics
"Capitated payments in the form of fixed monthly payments to cover all of the costs associated with delivering primary care could encourage primary care practices to transform the way they deliver care. Using a microsimulation model incorporating data from 969 US practices, we sought to understand whether shifting to team- and non-visit-based care is financially sustainable for practices under traditional fee-for-service, capitated payment, or a mix of the two. Practice revenues and costs were computed for fee-for-service payments and a range of capitated payments, before and after the substitution of team- and non-visit-based services for low-complexity in-person physician visits. The substitution produced financial losses for simulated practices under fee-for-service payment of $42,398 per full-time-equivalent physician per year; however, substitution produced financial gains under capitated payment in 95 percent of cases, if more than 63 percent of annual payments were capitated. Shifting to capitated payment might create an incentive for practices to increase their delivery of team- and non-visit-based primary care, if capitated payment levels were sufficiently high.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28874487/,economics
"This paper discusses the economic reforms initiated by Cuban President Raúl Castro in 2008 and its effect on the country's fast-growing, vulnerable population of older persons 60+ years of age. Cubans are living longer and the country has a very low birthrate. These two factors combined have reduced the proportion of the population in the work force. This adversely affects the economy. Population aging is a major reason why the government has introduced structural reforms and reduced social spending, which have weakened the welfare state on which older persons depend. Many older persons have become critical of the reforms over time. Policy makers need to address the impact the reforms are having on older Cubans and consider them as active participants in economic reform. Data for this paper come from qualitative, case study research carried out in Havana between the years 2008-15 and from a review of the literature on aging and economic reforms in Cuba.

"Background:
        
      
      To sustainably manage equitable access to effective drugs, many developed countries have established a national system to determine whether drugs should be reimbursed.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      Our objectives were (i) to investigate the role of pharmacoeconomic evidence in Dutch and Swedish drug reimbursement decision making; and (ii) to determine the extent to which appraising the importance of full economic evaluations relative to other evidence is a transparent process.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Data sources included all Dutch and Swedish drug reimbursement information published in the period January 2005 to July 2011.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After categorising all the reimbursement applications and decisions in published data sources, we selected all dossiers-in both countries-that included a full economic evaluation (i.e. cost-effectiveness and/or cost-utility analysis) and then investigated how the evidence was appraised for its societal value.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In The Netherlands, only 35 % of the 118 applications on List 1B (i.e. claiming added therapeutic value) were found to include pharmacoeconomic evidence. In all cases where drugs received a 'no' decision, combined with an evaluation that they were of similar (n = 7) or added (n = 5) therapeutic value, we found that the pharmacoeconomic evidence had been judged insufficiently robust. We also found that in 21 % of the 'yes' decisions, combined with an evaluation of similar (n = 2) or added (n = 2) therapeutic value, the pharmacoeconomic evidence had been judged insufficiently robust. In Sweden, we found that drugs that received a 'no' decision (n = 39) had been judged either not cost effective (74 %) or not supported by sufficiently credible data (26 %). Nearly all drugs that received a 'yes' decision (n = 252) had been judged cost effective (92 %). However, of all these judgements, 53 % were based on a price comparison and 10 % on a cost-minimisation analysis; only 33 % were based on a full economic evaluation. More economic evaluations were available in Sweden than in The Netherlands (97 vs. 31, respectively), mainly due to the numerous exemptions from pharmacoeconomic evidence in The Netherlands (65 %). Dossiers for only 11 drugs included a full economic evaluation in both countries; of these, the reimbursement decisions differed for four drugs. Appraisal elements were reported only descriptively; their actual influence on the final decision remained unclear. In four dossiers, the (high) severity of the treatable disease was explicitly mentioned in both countries; three of these were identical and related to indications in cancer.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both countries publish drug reimbursement information. Therapeutic value appears to be the most decisive criterion; the relative importance of full economic evaluations is more modest than would generally be expected, especially in The Netherlands. Although the assessment process is reasonably transparent, both countries could make the appraisal process more transparent by more explicitly showing the actual role of each different (societal) criterion in their decision making.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-013-0074-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23839699/,economics
"Since 2013, the process of pricing of innovative drugs by the French National Health Insurance has considered both cost-effectiveness and budget impact. CAR-T cell therapies were first subject to economic evaluation from 2019 in France. We aim to describe the process and results of the economic evaluation of tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel as well as the challenges these evaluations raised. Evaluations submitted by the firms were reviewed by HAS and submitted to the Committee of Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP). The CEESP issued opinions related to: (1) the methodological quality of economic evidence and, (2) the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the drugs. The CEESP invalidated the estimated incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of tisagenlecleucel due to the insufficient clinical evidence and methodological quality to extrapolate the long-term progression of the disease after treatment and compare tisagenlecleucel with alternatives. The CEESP concluded that tisagenlecleucel was not proven cost-effective. The estimated ICUR of axicabtagene ciloleucel at €114,509/QALY vs. chemotherapies was associated with an acceptable level of methodological quality despite being based on a weak indirect comparison and limited data on quality of life. The CEESP considered axicabtagene ciloleucel ICUR to be ""very high"" and questioned the societal/community willingness-to-pay of the claimed price. The primary source of uncertainty surrounding the ICUR estimates of both drugs was the lack of hindsight on effectiveness. The economic evaluation of CAR-T cell therapies highlights the risk of inefficient resource allocation driven by limited clinical data. It calls for payment schemes accounting for this risk and effective collection of post-marketing data.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bulcan.2021.09.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34629167/,economics

"The design of waste management systems rarely accounts for the spatio-temporal evolution of the demand. However, recent studies suggest that this evolution affects the planning of waste management activities like the choice and location of treatment facilities. As a result, the transport structure could also be affected by these changes. The objective of this paper is to study the influence of the spatio-temporal evolution of the demand on the strategic planning of a waste transport structure. More particularly this study aims at evaluating the effect of varying spatial parameters on the economic performance of hierarchical structures (with one transfer station). To this end, three consecutive generations of three different spatial distributions were tested for hierarchical and non-hierarchical transport structures based on costs minimization. Results showed that a hierarchical structure is economically viable for large and clustered spatial distributions. The distance parameter was decisive but the loading ratio of trucks and the formation of clusters of sources also impacted the attractiveness of the transfer station. Thus the territories' morphology should influence strategies as regards to the installation of transfer stations.

      Neoplastic changes (mild or high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (L- or HGIEN) or early cancer) in Barrett esophagus are treated with various methods. This study compares clinical-economical aspects of sole stepwise radical endoscopic resection (SRER) against combination treatment with EMR (Endoscopic mucosal resection) and RFA (radiofrequency ablation).
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Based on clinical data from a randomized controlled trial 1 we developed an economic model for costs of treatment according to the German Hospital Remuneration System (G-DRG). Our calculating incorporated initial treatment costs and the cost of treating complications (both paid via G-DRG).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Medical and economically, the treatment with EMR + RFA advantages over sole SRER treatment 1. The successful complete resection or destruction of neoplastic intestinal metaplastic tissue is similar in both procedures. Acute complications (24 vs. 13 % in SRER EMR + RFA) and late complications (88 vs. 13 % in SRER EMR + RFA) are significantly more likely in sole SRER than in the EMR + RFA.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      While SRER initially appears more cost-effective as a sole therapy, cost levels move significantly above EMR+RFA due to higher complication rates and following procedures costs. Overall, the costs of treatment was € 13 272.11 in the SRER group and € 11 389.33 in the EMR + RFA group. The EMR + RFA group thus achieved a cost advantage of € 1882.78. The study shows that the treatment of neoplastic Barrett esophagus with EMR + RFA is also appropriate in economic terms.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-103246,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27171331/,economics
"In the study, the nexus among energy consumption, foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth, and trade openness is examined by newly developed Fourier ADL (2017) and ARDL tests cover the period 1980-2015 in Turkey. Findings indicated that energy consumption, FDI, economic growth, and trade openness are cointegrated. In addition, it is determined that an increase in economic growth and trade openness positively affects energy consumption both in the long-term and short-term but FDI has only a positive effect in the long-term. VECM causality results indicated that FDI, economic growth, and trade openness are the causes of energy consumption in the long-term. In this context, Turkish policymakers should change the composition of FDI through various incentive policies to provide energy efficiency. FDI inflows should be shifted from sectors using dirty technology to clean technologies such as the information technology and services sector. In addition, increasing FDI that included green technology and renewable energy sources may promote energy efficiency in Turkey.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05996-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31363976/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To estimate the total costs of multiple sclerosis (MS) for all Canadians in 1994.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prevalence-based study estimating disease-related societal costs for Canadians with MS in 1994. The human capital approach was used to estimate the value of lost productivity due to illness. Two components were revealed: first, direct costs, in terms of expenditures on hospital care, other institutions, physician services, other health professionals, drugs, and other expenditures; and second, indirect costs, in terms of lost productivity due to premature mortality and disability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total costs of MS for Canadians were $502.3 million in 1994, with direct and indirect cost components at $188.6 million and $313.7 million, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study highlights the scope and magnitude of the economic consequences of MS for Canadians.

However the concepts and methods used have inherent weaknesses, especially in the determination of relevant and exact effect sizes.

However, there is paucity of information on practical insights and best practices that have helped implementing organisations to successfully embed VfM in practice for programming and evaluation. In this article, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of approaches that been used and insights on best practices to manage for, demonstrate, and compare VfM, using a health pooled fund programme implemented in conflict-affected South Sudan as case study supported by evidence reported in the literature while critiquing adequacy of the available approaches in this setting. An expanded and iterative process framework to guide VfM embedding for health programming and evaluation is then proposed. In doing so, this article provides a very relevant one-stop source for critical insight into how to embed VfM in practice. Uptake and scale-up of the proposed framework can be essential in improving VfM and aid effectiveness which will ultimately contribute to progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2019.101725,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31629248/,economics
"This paper reviews the literature on reference pricing (RP) in pharmaceutical markets. The RP strategy for cost containment of expenditure on drugs is analyzed as part of the procurement mechanism. We review the existing literature and the state-of-the-art regarding RP by focusing on its economic effects. In particular, we consider: (1) the institutional context and problem-related factors which appear to underline the need to implement an RP strategy; i.e. its nature, characteristics and the sort of health care problems commonly addressed; (2) how RP operates in practice; that is, how third party-payers (the insurers/buyers) have established the RP systems existing on the international scene (i.e. information methods, monitoring procedures and legislative provisions); (3) the range of effects resulting from particular RP strategies (including effects on choice of appropriate pharmaceuticals, insurer savings, total drug expenditures, prices of referenced and non-referenced products and dynamic efficiency; (4) the market failures which an RP policy is supposed to address and the main advantages and drawbacks which emerge from an analysis of its effects. Results suggest that RP systems achieve better their postulated goals (1) if cost inflation in pharmaceuticals is due to high prices rather than to the excess of prescription rates, (2) when the larger is the existing difference in prices among equivalent drugs, and (3) more important is the actual market for generics.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(00)00100-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11094265/,economics

"This review was aimed at the evolution of health economic models used in evaluations of clinical approaches aimed at preventing osteoporotic fractures. Models have improved, with medical continuance becoming increasingly recognized as a contributor to health and economic outcomes, as well as advancements in epidemiological data. Model-based health economic evaluation studies are increasingly used to investigate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporotic fracture preventions and treatments. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the evolution of health economic models used in the evaluation of osteoporotic fracture preventions. Electronic searches within MEDLINE and EMBASE were carried out using a predefined search strategy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select relevant studies. References listed of included studies were searched to identify any potential study that was not captured in our electronic search. Data on country, interventions, type of fracture prevention, evaluation perspective, type of model, time horizon, fracture sites, expressed costs, types of costs included, and effectiveness measurement were extracted. Seventy-four models were described in 104 publications, of which 69% were European. Earlier models focused mainly on hip, vertebral, and wrist fracture, but later models included multiple fracture sites (humerus, pelvis, tibia, and other fractures). Modeling techniques have evolved from simple decision trees, through deterministic Markov processes to individual patient simulation models accounting for uncertainty in multiple parameters. Treatment continuance has been increasingly taken into account in the models in the last decade. Models have evolved in their complexity and emphasis, with medical continuance becoming increasingly recognized as a contributor to health and economic outcomes. This evolution may be driven in part by the desire to capture all the important differentiating characteristics of medications under scrutiny, as well as the advancement in epidemiological data relevant to osteoporosis fractures.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-013-2551-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24154803/,economics
"In 1993 the Victorian Government introduced casemix funding as part of its restructure of the public hospital system. Casemix funding provides a new basis for government funding according to outcomes. At the same time, restructure of hospitals allows for a reconsideration of who is eligible to use them.

"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the economic impact on the hospital of a hospitalist program and to develop insights into the relative economic importance of variables such as reductions in mean length of stay and cost, improvements in throughput (patients discharged per unit time), payer methods of reimbursement, and the cost of the hospitalist program.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      The primary data source was Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston. Patient demographics, utilization, cost, and revenue data were obtained from the hospital's cost accounting system and medical records.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      The hospitalist admitted and managed all patients during a six-week period on the general medical unit of Tufts-New England Medical Center. Reimbursement, cost, length of stay, and throughput outcomes during this period were contrasted with patients admitted to the unit in the same period in the prior year, in the preceding period, and in the following period.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      The hospitalist group compared with the control group demonstrated: length of stay reduced to 2.19 days from 3.45 days (p<.001); total hospital costs per admission reduced to 1,775 dollars from 2,332 dollars (p<.001); costs per day increased to 811 dollars from 679 dollars (p<.001); no differences for readmission within 30 days of discharge to extended care facilities. The hospital's expected incremental profitability with the hospitalist was -1.44 dollars per admission excluding incremental throughput effects, and it was most sensitive to changes in the ratio of per diem to case rate reimbursement. Incremental throughput with the hospitalist was estimated at 266 patients annually with an associated incremental profitability of 1.3 million dollars.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Hospital interventions designed to reduce length of stay, such as the hospitalist, should be evaluated in terms of cost, throughput, and reimbursement effects. Excluding throughput effects, the hospitalist program was not economically viable due to the influence of per diem reimbursement. Throughput improvements occasioned by the hospitalist program with high baseline occupancy levels are substantial and tend to favor a hospitalist program.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.00152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12822918/,economics
"The National Health Service (NHS) accounts for more than 98% of the UK prescription medicines market, which is the sixth largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Most of this market is driven by the UK's approximately 35,000 general practitioners (GPs). It is an open market, with most leading foreign pharmaceutical companies having a strong presence. While the growth rate of this market has been decelerating, it remains one of the fastest growing components of NHS expenditure. The NHS does not operate any kind of national reimbursement list, but the UK government has adopted several means to keep medicines expenditure under control. These include cash incentives and constraints for GPs relating to expenditure on medicines, individual quarterly updates on GP prescribing, the publication of a list of medicines that cannot be prescribed by GPs, the switching of some prescription-only medicines to over-the-counter medicines, and a co-payment system. The main form of economic regulation in the UK, however, remains the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS). This limits the rate-of-return on capital attributable to medicines sales to the NHS, with the intended rate-of-return being equal to that of UK industry overall. The pharmaceutical industry has generally performed relatively well in the UK market, managing to preserve incentives to innovation. This reflects the fact that UK GPs have been able to maintain their clinical freedom, as well as government recognition of the economic contribution made by the pharmaceutical industry. Current issues of interest in the UK pharmaceutical market context include the future of the PPRS, the debates over the imposition of a national formulary and generic substitution, and over parallel trade, the potential impact of managed-care protocols and computer-based prescribing on pharmaceutical expenditures, and possible political changes.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199600102-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10163432/,economics
"Over the past twenty-five years, the average ratio of hospital charges for services (gross revenues) to payments received (net revenues) has grown from 1.1 to 2.6. This reflects a transition from predominantly cost- and charge-based payment systems to regulated and negotiated fixed payments. Hospitals have been able to squeeze additional revenues from remaining charge-based payers and services by sharply increasing charges, negatively affecting the uninsured. Although protection of the uninsured seems warranted, it might be difficult to regulate hospital pricing systems in isolation from other controversial issues, such as the acceptability of cross-subsidies and the role of market forces.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.25.1.45,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16403744/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to analyze the health care costs and savings associated with quality improvement (QI) interventions initiated and implemented utilizing NSQIP.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Five acute care facilities of Alberta Health Services (AHS) adopted NSQIP in 2015 for a pilot project.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The cost-savings of NSQIP were estimated from the start of NSQIP to the end of 2017 under an AHS perspective using this formula: Gross cost-savings = N * (p1 - p2) * unit cost, where N was the number of surgical patients after the intervention, p1 was the probability of event occurrence (within 30 days of surgery) before the intervention, p2 was the probability of event occurrence after the intervention, and unit cost is health care cost per event. To calculate the net cost-savings, we deducted the costs of NSQIP and its interventions from the gross cost-savings.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The QI initiatives initiated by NSQIP to reduce surgical events had significant impacts clinically and economically. The gross cost-savings of NSQIP were estimated at $11.4 million. Subtracting the costs of NSQIP and its interventions ($2.6 million) from the gross cost-savings, the net cost-savings were $8.8 million. The return on investment ratio was 4.3, meaning that every $1.00 invested in NSQIP would bring $4.30 in returns. The sensitivity analysis showed the probability for NSQIP to be cost-saving was 95%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      QI interventions initiated and implemented utilizing NSQIP appear to be effective and cost-saving for AHS. These cost-savings would be even larger if NSQIP was prolonged in the pilot sites and/or expanded to other sites across the province.",https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000002708,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29465460/,economics
"Many governments are trying to invent new types of 'internal' healthcare market that will expose health services to competitive pressures to innovate, contain costs, raise service quality, and respond better to consumer demands; but not expose them to 'market failures' which prejudice universal access to 'basic' health services. Policy debates in this area are muddled and constricted by a failure to differentiate the variants of internal market that are available. This article outlines a taxonomy of the main types of internal market: primary doctor purchasing; managed competition; competitive bidding; social insurance; and compulsory private insurance. It notes their main structural characteristics and differences.

"Despite inflation and a robust economy, standard Medicare reimbursements for vascular surgical procedures have progressively declined. The objective of this analysis was to quantitatively and objectively evaluate the decline of vascular surgical reimbursement over the past decade. In this study, data for the analysis of specific vascular surgical procedures was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics-National Hospital Discharge Survey (NCHS-NHDS) for all vascular procedures as reported by ICD-9-CM codes. The average Medicare reimbursement for each of the specified procedures for 1990 was compared to that of 2001 and the percent change in average reimbursement over this period was calculated. Comparisons between 1990 and 2001 dollar amounts were made after correction for inflation using the consumer price index. This correction factor allows for the calculation of the actual percentage reduction in ""real dollars"" that is reflected in buying power. We found significant decreases in Medicare reimbursement for each of the vascular procedures included in this analysis. Despite national economic prosperity, there was an average 41% decrease in the buying power per case for vascular surgical procedures over the past decade.

"Alongside the debate around clinical, scientific, and ethical aspects of assisted reproductive technology (ART), there exists a parallel debate around the economics of ART treatment and what is the most appropriate funding framework for providing safe, equitable, and cost-effective treatment. The cost of ART treatment from a patient perspective exhibits striking differences worldwide due to the costliness of underlying health care systems and the level of public and third-party subsidization. These relative cost differences affect not only who can afford to access ART treatment but how ART is practiced in terms of embryo transfer practices; in turn significantly impacting the health outcomes and costs of caring for ART conceived children. Although empirical evidence indicates that ART treatment is ""good value money"" from a societal and patient perspective, the challenge remains to communicate this to policy makers, primarily because fertility treatments are not easily accommodated by traditional health economic methods. Furthermore, with global demand for ART treatment likely to increase, it is important that future funding decisions are informed by what has been learned about how costs and economic incentives influence equity of access and clinical practice. In this review we provide an international perspective on the costs and consequences of ART and summarize key economic considerations from the perspective of ART patients, providers, and society as a whole in the coming decade.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23905708/,economics
"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) claims to lead to less pain, faster recovery and/or healing, smaller scars and a shorter hospital stay, ideally in combination with lower costs. This article discusses which aspects of the economic evaluation of MIS, from the perspective of the statutory health insurance (SHI), are relevant. The economic perspective of the statutory health insurance primarily comprises the expenditures for illness (e.g. medical treatment, drugs, rehabilitation, sick-pay), i.e. direct costs only. Indirect costs (i.e. productivity losses) remain unconsidered. Thus, the perspective of the SHI describes only a reduced view of reality. However, on the basis of proven efficacy, cost-minimisation and cost-benefit analyses for certain questions are conceivable from the perspective of the SHI.

"The problem of portfolio optimization is one of the most important issues in asset management. We here propose a new dynamic portfolio strategy based on the time-varying structures of MST networks in Chinese stock markets, where the market condition is further considered when using the optimal portfolios for investment. A portfolio strategy comprises two stages: First, select the portfolios by choosing central and peripheral stocks in the selection horizon using five topological parameters, namely degree, betweenness centrality, distance on degree criterion, distance on correlation criterion and distance on distance criterion. Second, use the portfolios for investment in the investment horizon. The optimal portfolio is chosen by comparing central and peripheral portfolios under different combinations of market conditions in the selection and investment horizons. Market conditions in our paper are identified by the ratios of the number of trading days with rising index to the total number of trading days, or the sum of the amplitudes of the trading days with rising index to the sum of the amplitudes of the total trading days. We find that central portfolios outperform peripheral portfolios when the market is under a drawup condition, or when the market is stable or drawup in the selection horizon and is under a stable condition in the investment horizon. We also find that peripheral portfolios gain more than central portfolios when the market is stable in the selection horizon and is drawdown in the investment horizon. Empirical tests are carried out based on the optimal portfolio strategy. Among all possible optimal portfolio strategies based on different parameters to select portfolios and different criteria to identify market conditions, 65% of our optimal portfolio strategies outperform the random strategy for the Shanghai A-Share market while the proportion is 70% for the Shenzhen A-Share market.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28129333/,economics
"The purposes of the present study were to describe the welfare expenditure for people with disabilities and examine its relation to national economic growth from 1991 to 2006 in Taiwan. We analyzed data mainly from the information of population with disabilities, disability welfare expenditure and national economic growth and gross national product (GNP) per capita in Taiwan from 1991 to 2006. The percentage and overtime trend were used to examine the change in disability welfare expenditure, national economic growth and GNP per capita. Taiwan's economy continued its steady expansion on record an annual average growth of 5.4% and GNP per capita of 5.7% for the year 1991-2006. At the same period of time, the registered population with disabilities increased nearly five times (204,158 persons in 1991 to 981,015 persons in 2006), the government disability welfare expenditure was dramatically increasing to over 10 times from 1991 to 2006 (US$ 74 million to US$ 784 million). Although the total disability budget increased, the beneficiary of the individual with disability increased only 2.2 times. In the content of annual welfare budget for people with disabilities, it is difficult to figure out the increase pattern of the budget growth. However, the local government plays a vital role in disability welfare services gradually, it provides more than 85% welfare budget for people with disabilities.

"Background:
        
      
      Demand for economic evaluations in health care is growing with expectations that they will help to develop regional and national policies on health and social programmes. We present here the scope, quality and content of systematic reviews and meta-analyses relating to the economics of dentistry published over the last 15 years.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To review the quality and outcome of systematic reviews and meta-analyses relating to the economics of dental treatments, preventions and services.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was conducted in 14 electronic databases for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between January 1997 and July 2011 on the economics of oral disorders and oral health care. Review papers were extracted by two independent investigators to identify the characteristics, results and quality of the reviews and to highlight gaps in knowledge about the economics of dentistry.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 3150 unique references, we found 73 systematic reviews or meta-analyses of dental economics as primary or secondary outcomes. The focus of 12 of them was on the cost or cost-effectiveness of dental prevention, 54 on treatment, five on prevention and treatment and two on delivery of dental services. However, only 12 of the systematic reviews drew conclusions from economic data, and four of them constructed an economic model from synthesized data. Overall, the quality was good in the 12 systematic reviews but poor in the original studies.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that price controls on medical innovations can expand investment in medical R&D and results in Pareto superior social outcomes, a consequence of the price controls' ability to increase saving. Importantly, this finding occurs only when the price cap regime is extensive: selective regulation on few technologies - such as pharmaceuticals alone - have the conventional negative effect on innovation.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23339083/,economics

Though these proposals varied widely, they encompassed only three proposed methods for paying physicians: fee-for-service, salary, and capitation. When examined from a perspective that considers the incentives affecting practicing physicians, each of these methods has serious flaws. I outline these flaws and suggest an alternative method for reimbursing primary care physicians: that of combining capitation and fee-for-service. Specialists would be paid fee-for-service, but the cost of specialty care would be limited by giving each primary care physician a budget for such care. Consistent failure by a physician to stay within the budget would result in ongoing review, but not in direct financial sanctions. This system of reimbursing physicians is intended to balance incentives so that physicians can concentrate on making medical decisions with a minimum of distraction by third parties and by personal financial considerations.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.267.3.403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1727965/,economics
"This paper describes an instrument for measuring the social value of changes in health status, the Relative Social Willingness to Pay. It is a unique combination of measurement attributes designed to minimise cognitive complexity and provide an additional option for measuring 'social value'. Similar to the person trade-off (PTO), it adopts a social perspective and asks respondents to evaluate programmes on behalf of society. Unlike the PTO, trade-offs between the options use dollars, not numbers of patients. Respondents are not, however, asked for their personal willingness to pay. Rather, the opportunity cost of funds spent on one service is as an offsetting reduction in funds for a second service. The amount spent on each service therefore indicates relative, not absolute, value. However, the two services combine to produce one Quality adjusted life year which allows the calculation of a Quality adjusted life year-like unit of social value on a 0-1 scale. A three-stage survey was used to test the instrument's reliability, validity and sensitivity to the framing of the main question. Results indicate that the Relative Social Willingness to Pay produces values similar to but less than the PTO and time trade-off techniques.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2950,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23824989/,economics

"This paper studies the effects of generic drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. Two firms produce two branded goods, with a different active ingredient, and the patent for one of them has expired, so that a generic alternative is in the market. This paper focuses on the case where the branded goods are perfect substitutes and where there exists a degree of differentiation between the branded and the generic goods. The study looks at whether the firm producing the branded good whose patent has expired has incentives to produce its own generic alternative too. For this purpose, the scenario where the firm producing the branded good also produces the generic drug is compared with the situation where the generic good is produced by a third firm. It is found that the firm producing the branded good has incentives to produce its generic alternative, owing to a market segmentation effect. This induces an increase in the price of the branded good produced by this firm, which in turn implies a welfare reduction.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199911)8:7<599::aid-hec479>3.0.co;2-k,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10544326/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The rate of increase in spending on specialty pharmaceuticals is outpacing by far the rate of increase in spending for other drugs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To explore the strategies payers are using in response to challenges related to coverage, cost, clinical management, and access of specialty pharmaceuticals and to describe the potential implications for key stakeholders, including patients, physicians, and health care purchasers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sources of information were identified in the course of providing consulting services in the subject area of specialty pharmaceuticals to health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, employers, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Specialty pharmaceuticals represent the fastest growing segment of drug spending due to new product approvals, high unit costs, and increasing use. Health care payers are faced with significant challenges related to coverage, cost, clinical management, and access. A variety of short- and long-term strategies have been employed to address these challenges.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Current management techniques for specialty pharmaceuticals often represent a stop-gap approach for controlling rising drug costs. Optimum cost and care management methods will evolve as further research identifies the true clinical and economic value of various specialty pharmaceuticals.",https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2006.12.9.736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17249906/,economics
"Privatization currently enjoys wide appeal as a solution to public problems. Supporters of privatization hope that shifting responsibility for the funding, administration, and delivery of services to private organizations and individuals will spur market competition and thus lower costs, improve service effectiveness, and enhance program quality. An increasingly common form of privatization in health and human services is contracting with nonprofit organizations. Such contracting, in practice, does not follow market principles but is, instead, fraught with politics and inadequate information and built on long-term relationships between government and contract agencies. The operations and practices of contracting have important implications for the ongoing debate on the desirability of vouchers for health care insurance and for reform in the contracting process.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-17-2-233,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1500647/,economics
"We assess the potential of increased economic competition by examining whether Medicare beneficiaries are willing to switch to physicians who agree to accept all services on assignment. Data come from a survey of Medicare beneficiaries conducted in November 1988. Our principal finding is that beneficiaries are not sensitive to price when making decisions about whether or not to switch physicians. Less than one-half of 1 percent of the sample had switched physicians for economic reasons in the year prior to the survey. Furthermore, willingness to switch was not correlated with ability to pay.

"Community psychiatric nurses (CPNs) in the United Kingdom are increasingly working in primary health care settings with less serious mental health problems. This paper describes an economic evaluation of their work using a randomized controlled trial in which 231 patients were assigned to continuing general practitioner care or one of two conditions of CPN intervention. This is only the third systematic economic analysis of community mental health nursing in the UK and the first carried out by mental health nurses. Various costs to patients, their families and the health care system were determined. Results showed that patients receiving CPN intervention experienced less absence from work and that this resulted in a net benefit. However, the cost per quality adjusted life year for intervening with this group of patients was probably several times more than for intervening with the seriously mentally ill. Therefore, if one considers both the clinical and economic results of the study, taken together with the recent results of the review of mental health nursing, there seems little justification for CPNs continuing to work in this area.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2648.1995.22040769.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8708198/,economics
"The forms of market competition define prices. The pharmaceutical market contains submarkets with different levels of competition; on the one hand are the innovating products with patents, and on the other, generic products with or without trade names. Innovating medicines generally have monopolistic prices, but when the patents expire prices drop because of competition from therapeutic alternatives. The trade name makes it easier to maintain monopolistic prices. In Mexico, medicine prices in the private market are high--according to aggregated estimates and prices for specific medicines--which reflect the limitations of pharmaceutical market competition and the power of the trade name.

"Importance:
        
      
      The economic effect of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) on individuals with the disorder, their families, and society as a whole is poorly understood and has not been updated in light of recent findings.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To update estimates of age-specific, direct, indirect, and lifetime societal economic costs, including new findings on indirect costs, such as individual and parental productivity costs, associated with ASDs.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A literature review was conducted of US and UK studies on individuals with ASDs and their families in October 2013 using the following keywords: age, autism spectrum disorder, prevalence, accommodation, special education, productivity loss, employment, costs, and economics. Current data on prevalence, level of functioning, and place of residence were combined with mean annual costs of services and support, opportunity costs, and productivity losses of individuals with ASDs with or without intellectual disability.
    


          Exposure:
        
      
      Presence of ASDs.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Mean annual medical, nonmedical, and indirect economic costs and lifetime costs were measured for individuals with ASDs separately for individuals with and without intellectual disability in the United States and the United Kingdom.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cost of supporting an individual with an ASD and intellectual disability during his or her lifespan was $2.4 million in the United States and £1.5 million (US $2.2 million) in the United Kingdom. The cost of supporting an individual with an ASD without intellectual disability was $1.4 million in the United States and £0.92 million (US $1.4 million) in the United Kingdom. The largest cost components for children were special education services and parental productivity loss. During adulthood, residential care or supportive living accommodation and individual productivity loss contributed the highest costs. Medical costs were much higher for adults than for children.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      The substantial direct and indirect economic effect of ASDs emphasizes the need to continue to search for effective interventions that make best use of scarce societal resources. The distribution of economic effect across many different service systems raises questions about coordination of services and sectors.

"Clinical trial protocols represent a significant component of the research program at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Currently, there are nearly 800 active protocols using more than 150 investigational drugs. Sponsors of these trials include the National Cancer Institute, numerous pharmaceutical companies, and a variety of other funding sources. Because of our large patient base, however, routine participation in cooperative groups is limited. The impact of clinical trial protocols on patient care systems is a growing concern that is addressed primarily by the Surveillance Committee at M.D. Anderson. Like many institutional review boards, this committee reviews all protocols and must grant approval before the activation of any clinical trial. The issues of medical ethics, including a risk-benefit assessment for research subjects, equitable patient selection, safeguards for economically disadvantaged populations, and the general requirements for informed consent, also fall under the purview of this board. For any comprehensive cancer center to succeed, it must have strong research programs that enhance treatment options for patients. The crisis in financing health care significantly threatens the viability of cancer research. Reimbursement for the related costs of individuals participating in clinical trials has become a battle ground for third-party payers. The resulting economic risk is shared by health care providers and patients. As a consequence, many cancer centers, including M.D. Anderson, have initiated an economic-impact analysis for protocols as a component of the review process. This analysis includes an estimation of the patient care costs compared to the funding allocated to support the research. Future research will include pharmacoeconomic analysis and other ways to relate the costs and outcomes of treatment protocols. In the interim, we must monitor reimbursement trends for patients enrolled in clinical trials closely and amend the informed consent process to include a discussion of potential economic risk or hardship to patients if insurance claims are denied. Cancer care providers, third-party payers, the federal government, and society at large must work together to address the funding of cancer research and patient care.",https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19931101)72:9+<2824::aid-cncr2820721510>3.0.co;2-q,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8402512/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Significant health expenses can force households to reduce consumption of items required for daily living and long-term well-being, depriving them of the capability to lead economically stable and healthy lives. Previous studies of out-of-pocket (OOP) and other health expenses have typically characterized them as ""catastrophic"" in terms of a threshold level or percentage of household income. We aim to re-conceptualize the impact of health expenses on household ""flourishing"" in terms of ""basic capabilities.""
    


          Methods and findings:
        
      
      We conducted a 2008 survey covering 697 households, on consumption patterns and health treatments for the previous 12 months. We compare consumption patterns between households with and without inpatient treatment, and between households with different levels of outpatient treatment, for the entire study sample as well as among different income quartiles. We find that compared to households without inpatient treatment and with lower levels of outpatient treatment, households with inpatient treatment and higher levels of outpatient treatment reduced investments in basic capabilities, as evidenced by decreased consumption of food, education and production means. The lowest income quartile showed the most significant decrease. No quartile with inpatient or high-level outpatient treatment was immune to reductions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The effects of health expenses on consumption patterns might well create or exacerbate poverty and poor health, particularly for low income households. We define health expenditures as catastrophic by their reductions of basic capabilities.

This paper appraises the use of the Herfindahl market share index as an exogenous competition variable in empirical studies of the hospital sector. An analysis of cross-sectional Florida data shows that this index itself is significantly influenced by the demand and supply factors commonly included in econometric models of hospital performance.

"Economic analyses have become increasingly important in healthcare in general and with respect to pharmaceuticals in particular. If economic analyses are to play an important and useful role in the allocation of scarce healthcare resources, then such analyses must be performed properly and with care. This article outlines some of the basic principles of pharmacoeconomic analysis. Every analysis should have an explicitly stated perspective, which, unless otherwise justified, should be a societal perspective. Cost minimisation, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses are a family of techniques used in economic analyses. Cost minimisation analysis is appropriate when alternative therapies have identical outcomes, but differ in costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis is appropriate when alternative therapies differ in clinical effectiveness but can be examined from the same dimension of health outcome. Cost-utility analysis can be used when alternative therapies may be examined using multiple dimensions of health outcome, such as morbidity and mortality. Cost-benefit analysis requires the benefits of therapy to be described in monetary units and is not usually the technique of choice. The technique used in an analysis should be described and explicitly defended according to the problem being examined. For each technique, the method of determining costs is the same; direct, indirect, and intangible costs can be considered. The specific costs to be used depend on the analytical perspective; a societal perspective implies the use of both direct and indirect economic costs. A modelling framework such as a decision tree, influence diagram, Markov chain, or network simulation must be used to structure the analysis explicitly. Regardless of the choice of framework, all modelling assumptions should be described. The mechanism of data collection for model inputs must be detailed and defended. Models must undergo careful verification and validation procedures. Following baseline analysis of the model, further analyses should examine the role of uncertainty in model assumptions and data.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199201010-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10147037/,economics

"This article identifies factors that influence the choice between joining an HMO and remaining with the traditional fee-for-service system among aged Medicare beneficiaries in three communities. Sources of marketing information were found to be strongly and positively related to the decision to join the HMO. Among beneficiaries who had to switch providers to join, persons who had a prior usual source of care and those who were satisfied with the amount of paperwork required to use that source of care were less likely to enroll in the HMO. Persons who did not have to switch providers to join the HMO were more likely to enroll in the prepaid program if they were satisfied with the amount of paperwork involved in using the HMO prior to the demonstration. Differences among the three communities suggest that the barrier to HMO enrollment presented by having a prior source of care who is not affiliated with the HMO may attenuate as the number of competing HMOs in the community increases, making the medical care environment more competitive. In the community with the most HMOs, persons who already had supplemental insurance were less likely to enroll than those who did not.

On the basis of empirical examples (World Health Organization) and diagrammatic illustrations of the efficiency of market mechanisms, the present paper offers a visual illustration of the argument that market-oriented health systems seem to be more effective, and that government rules and regulations have to consider the demand AND supply sides of health care as well freedom AND responsibility simultaneously.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1267213,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21031327/,economics
"What is known and objective:
        
      
      Countries struggle to accommodate the introduction of new effective cancer medicines, while containing costs. Our objective is to comment on several pharmaco-economic challenges involved in determining the value of cancer medicines by reviewing cost-effectiveness thresholds for cancer medicines in several countries and by discussing the cost-effectiveness of anti-cancer biotechnology and orphan medicines.
    


          Comment:
        
      
      A literature search was carried out of PubMed, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and EconLit up to August 2009. Health technology assessment agencies in England and Scotland are willing to incur a higher cost per quality-adjusted life year for cancer medicines than for other medicines. Risk-sharing arrangements have been implemented to optimize the value of cancer medicines. The cost-effectiveness of biotechnology medicines in cancer care is challenged by their high price, and depends on the ability to identify the most responsive target population, through use of suitable biomarkers. The evaluation of orphan medicines in cancer care needs to balance the absence of an alternative therapy for a life-threatening disease against the high cost-effectiveness ratio, and usually weak clinical data.
    


          What is new and conclusion:
        
      
      Current strategies used to inform decisions on the funding of expensive anti-cancer medicines are commented on to highlight important issues and problems. Pharmaco-economic evaluation is an important tool for assessing the value of cancer medicines and to inform evidence-based decision making in cancer care. Value-judgments such as preferential consideration of anti-cancer medicines can then be made explicitly.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2710.2010.01181.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545607/,economics
"Determinants of universal healthcare (UHC) are poorly empirically understood. We undertook a comprehensive study of UHC development using a novel Evidenced Formal Coverage (EFC) index that combines three key UHC elements: legal framework, population coverage, and accessibility. Applying the EFC index measures (legislation, ≥90% skilled birth attendance, ≥85% formal coverage) to 194 countries, aggregating time-varying data from 1880-2008, this study investigates which macro-economic, political, and social indicators are major longitudinal predictors of developing EFC globally, and in middle-income countries. Overall, 75 of 194 countries implemented legal-text UHC legislation, of which 51 achieved EFC. In a country-year prospective longitudinal analysis of EFC prediction, higher GDP-per-capita (per GDP-per-capita doubling, relative risk [RR]=1.77, 95% CI: 1.49-2.10), higher primary school completion (per +20% completion, RR=2.30, 1.65-3.21), and higher adult literacy were significantly associated with achieving EFC. Results also identify a GDP-per-capita of I$5000 as a minimum level for development of EFC. GDP-per-capita and education were each robust predictors in middle-income countries, and education remained significant even controlling for time-varying GDP growth. For income-inequality, the GINI coefficient was suggestive in its role in predicting EFC (p=0.024). For social and political indicators, a greater degree of ethnic fractionalization (per +25%, RR=0.51, 0.38-0.70), proportional electoral system (RR=2.80, 1.22-6.40), and dictatorships (RR=0.10, 0.05-0.27) were further associated with EFC. The novel EFC index and this longitudinal prospective study together indicate that investment in both economic growth and education should be seen of equal importance for development of UHC. Our findings help in understanding the social and political drivers of universal healthcare, especially for transitioning countries.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.06.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23906506/,economics
"The ""resource curse"" phenomenon has been the subject of extensive research, with its causes and transmission mechanisms primarily examined from the perspectives of economic development and rent seeking. Education is a major factor contributing to economically sustainable development, owing to its potential for improving cognition and skill levels and thereby enhancing worker productivity. The crowding-out or crowding-in effect of natural resource dependence on public education spending has been identified as one of the key mechanisms of the resource curse or blessing. Using panel data from 31 Chinese provinces, this empirical study revealed a positive correlation between natural resource dependence and public education expenditure, demonstrating the impact of the crowding-in effect, exerted by natural resource dependence, on public education expenditure. Abundant natural resources can provide funds for education expenditure. The sample was further divided into eastern and central and western regions. The results indicate that the crowding-out effect of natural resource dependence only affects public education expenditure in the Eastern region, while the crowding-in effect of natural resource dependence on public education expenditure in the central and western regions. Research shows that the regional differences of crowding-out or crowding-in effect are very obvious, so the government should adopt transfer payment to promote balanced regional development. Better economic and social policies will help to translate wealth from natural resources into economic growth. Thus, a ""resource blessing"" may emerge to replace the ""resource curse."" Fairly distributed and higher quality education will enhance human capital, thereby promoting economic growth from its current resource-driven pattern to a knowledge-driven pattern.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3853-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535739/,economics

This study used a piloted postal questionnaire to assess the attitudes of these advisers to economic evaluations of drug therapy, and their perceptions of the barriers to achieving cost effective prescribing by use of these evaluations. There was a 65% response rate to the questionnaire. Economic issues were rated by advisers to be less important than clinical issues, but were considered at most meetings between advisers and primary care medical practitioners. Advisers wished to consider true cost effective prescribing but often felt obliged to consider drug acquisition costs and risks of budgetary overspends. The perceived inflexibility of existing structures within the British National Health Service and the lack of credibility of the evaluations (often perceived as pharmaceutical industry marketing) were the major barriers to the application of the evaluations. The paper concludes that advisers were keen to use economic evaluations to promote cost effective prescribing but were impeded by the perceived bias of existing studies and by rigid current NHS structures.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(97)00013-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10169062/,economics
"In vitro fertilization and embryo transplantation (IVF-ET) technology is one of the main treatments for infertility. But IVF-ET is expensive and has not be covered by health insurance in most developing countries. Therefore, how to obtain the maximum success rate with the minimum cost is a common concern of clinicians and patients. At present, the economic studies on IVF-ET mainly focus on different ovulation stimulating drugs, different ovulation stimulating protocols, different transplantation methods and the number of transplants. But the process of IVF-ET is complex, the relevant methods of economic study are diverse, and there are no unified standard for outcome indicators, so there is no unified conclusion for more economical and effective protocol by now. Therefore, to analyze the economic studies of IVF-ET, and to explore appropriate evaluation methods and cost-effective protocols will be helpful for reasonable allocation of medical resources and guidance of clinical selection. It would provide policy reference to include the costs of IVF-ET treatment in health insurance in the future.",https://doi.org/10.3785/j.issn.1008-9292.2019.10.18,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31901035/,economics

We propose a framework to examine convergence of health expenditures and use recent developments in unit root testing, namely the Lagrange multiplier univariate and panel approaches that allow for at most two structural breaks. Our main finding is that while univariate and panel tests that do not incorporate structural breaks fail to find evidence of convergence, univariate and panel LM tests that allow for structural breaks find strong evidence of convergence of per capita health expenditures of the UK, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and Spain to that of the USA.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1196,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17238220/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Epidemiological burden of modifiable mortality risk factors is recognized in literature; however, less is known on the economic losses due to a range of such risks.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To estimate production losses (indirect cost) of mortality associated with risk factors as classified in Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study in Poland in years 2000, 2010, and 2017.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We relied on the human capital method and societal perspective and used sex-, age-, region-, and risk-specific data on mortality due to modifiable risk factors and a set of socio-economic measures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The production losses due to mortality attributable to all investigated risk factors accounted for 19.6-21.0 billion PLN (Polish zloty; 2017 exchange rate: 1€ = 4.26 PLN) and 1.44-2.45% of gross domestic product, depending on year. Behavioural factors were the most important contributor to overall burden (16.7-18.2 billion PLN), followed by metabolic factors (6.8-7.6 billion PLN) and environmental and occupational factors (3.0-3.5 billion PLN). Of disaggregated risks, alcohol and tobacco, high systolic blood pressure, and dietary risks proved to lead to the highest losses. Cost per death was greatest for child and maternal malnutrition, followed by intimate partner violence and childhood sexual abuse and bullying. Moreover, a notable regional variation of indirect cost was identified with losses ranging from 1.21 to 1.81% of regional gross domestic product in 2017.

"Objective:
        
      
      To measure the economic output/input ratios for the various options of prevention of rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease (RF/RHD) and check the viability of primary prevention vis-à-vis secondary and tertiary preventions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Cost accounting of the various prevention options was calculated for each variable as available in literature. Actual data as obtainable for the financial year ending March 2006 were computed for the Pondicherry population. Both direct and indirect costs (including community/social costs) were worked out using mostly primary data and wherever necessary, secondary data. Certain scientific assumptions were used where exact data was not available.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Primary prevention is the definite viable economic option (1:1.56) compared to secondary (1: 1.07) and tertiary (1: 0.12) preventions. In fact, the current stress on only secondary and tertiary preventions is found to be economically unviable.

"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to present a review of economic evaluations conducted from a Canadian perspective and to characterize sources of evidence and statistical methods to analyze effectiveness measures, resource utilization, and uncertainty.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A search strategy was developed to identify Canadian economic evaluations published between January 2001 and June 2006. A standardized abstraction form was used to extract key data (e.g., study design, data sources, statistical methods).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 153 unique studies were included for review, of which 75 were evaluations of drug therapies and less than half were funded by industry. Cost-effectiveness analysis was the most common type of economic evaluation and 80 percent of the studies used modeling techniques. A single source of evidence for effectiveness measures was used in half of the studies. Statistical methods were commonly reported to compare effectiveness measures when the economic evaluation was conducted alongside a clinical trial but less commonly when determining effectiveness input parameters in model-based economic evaluations, or to analyze resource utilization data. Authors relied mostly on univariate sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty.

Health care costs have in some years grown at two to three or more times the rate of so-called ""normal"" inflation. The causes of this cost inflation are many and varied, although a number of the industry's participants tend to blame each other for much of the problem. The primary reaction to escalating costs has been regulatory pressure brought to bear on providers with the intent of forcing the health care system to function on reduced or controlled financial resources.

"Background:
        
      
      Long-term trials on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for primary cardiovascular disease prevention are scant. For that reason risk prediction models are used as a tool to project changes in cardiovascular disease incidence due to changes in risk factor levels observed in short-term randomized clinical trials. In this article, we summarize the literature on the application of these risk models in pharmacoeconomic studies for primary cardiovascular disease prevention interventions in high-income countries.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      We systematically reviewed the available literature on the application of cardiovascular disease risk models in pharmacoeconomic studies and assessed the quality of incorporation of risk models in these studies. Quality assessment indicated the distance between the characteristics of populations of the risk model and the studies reviewed, the frequent disagreement between risk model and study time horizons and the lack of proper consideration of the uncertainty surrounding risk predictions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Given that utilizing a risk model to project the effect of a pharmacological intervention to cardiovascular events provides an estimate of the intervention's clinical and economical impact, consideration should be paid to the agreement between the study and risk model populations as well as the level of uncertainty that these predictions add to the outcome of a decision-analytic model. In the absence of hard endpoint trials, the value of risk models to model pharmacological efficacy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention remains high, although their limitations should beacknowledged",https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487312448994,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22988567/,economics

"Objectives/purpose:
        
      
      The costs attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remain theoretical and largely unspecified. Current figures fail to capture the full health and economic burden caused by AMR across human, animal, and environmental health; historically many studies have considered only direct costs associated with human infection from a hospital perspective, primarily from high-income countries. The Global Antimicrobial Resistance Platform for ONE-Burden Estimates (GAP-ON€) network has developed a framework to help guide AMR costing exercises in any part of the world as a first step towards more comprehensive analyses for comparing AMR interventions at the local level as well as more harmonized analyses for quantifying the full economic burden attributable to AMR at the global level.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      GAP-ON€ (funded under the JPIAMR 8th call (Virtual Research Institute) is composed of 19 international networks and institutions active in the field of AMR. For this project, the Network operated by means of Delphi rounds, teleconferences and face-to-face meetings. The resulting costing framework takes a bottom-up approach to incorporate all relevant costs imposed by an AMR bacterial microbe in a patient, in an animal, or in the environment up through to the societal level.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The framework itemizes the epidemiological data as well as the direct and indirect cost components needed to build a realistic cost picture for AMR. While the framework lists a large number of relevant pathogens for which this framework could be used to explore the costs, the framework is sufficiently generic to facilitate the costing of other resistant pathogens, including those of other aetiologies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In order to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses to choose amongst different AMR-related interventions at local level, the costing of AMR should be done according to local epidemiological priorities and local health service norms. Yet the use of a common framework across settings allows for the results of such studies to contribute to cumulative estimates that can serve as the basis of broader policy decisions at the international level such as how to steer R&D funding and how to prioritize AMR amongst other issues. Indeed, it is only by building a realistic cost picture that we can make informed decisions on how best to tackle major health threats.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-020-00822-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33243302/,economics
"While there is broad agreement that the way that health care providers are paid affects their performance, the empirical literature on the impacts of provider payment reforms is surprisingly thin. During the 1990s and early 2000s, many European and Central Asian (ECA) countries shifted from paying hospitals through historical budgets to fee-for-service (FFS) or patient-based payment (PBP) methods (mostly variants of diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs). Using panel data on 28 countries over the period 1990-2004, we exploit the phased shift from historical budgets to explore aggregate impacts on hospital throughput, national health spending, and mortality from causes amenable to medical care. We use a regression version of difference-in-differences (DID) and two variants that relax the DID parallel trends assumption. We find that FFS and PBP both increased national health spending, including private (i.e. out-of-pocket) spending. However, they had different effects on inpatient admissions (FFS increased them; PBP had no effect), and average length of stay (FFS had no effect; PBP reduced it). Of the two methods, only PBP appears to have had any beneficial effect on ""amenable mortality"", but we found significant impacts for only a couple of causes of death, and not in all model specifications.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2010.05.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20566226/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      With respect to economic aspects it remains questionable if tertiary hospitals should focus on operations with high complexity or if surgery for benign diseases should be performed as well.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Data from the Institute for Reimbursement in hospitals (InEK) were analyzed for esophageal and pancreatic surgery and for appendectomy, cholezystectomy and thyroid surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Operations with a high complexity showed a slightly better revenue-cost relation. Earnings in esophageal and pancreatic surgery varied between 590 EUR and 1,977 EUR, while in operations for benign diseases it ranged from 492 EUR to 1,648 EUR. In patients with a longer hospital stay this advantage diminished. The cost-revenue ratio was much more stable for patients with appendectomy, cholezystectomy or thyroid resection.

"Solutions to support older people to live independently and reduce the cost of an ageing population are high on the political agenda of most developed countries. Help-at-home schemes offer a mix of community support with the aim to address a range of well-being needs. However, not much is currently known about the costs, outcomes and economic consequences of such schemes. Understanding their impact on individuals' well-being and the economic consequences for local and central government can contribute to decisions about sustainable long-term care financing. This article presents results from a mixed-methods study of a voluntary sector-provided help-at-home scheme in England for people of 55 years and older. The study followed a participatory approach, which involved staff and volunteers. Data were collected during 2012 and 2013. Social care-related quality of life was measured with the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit for 24 service users (59% response rate) when they started using the scheme and 4-6 months later. A customised questionnaire that captured resource use and well-being information was sent to 1064 service users (63% response rate). The same tool was used in assessment with service users who started using the scheme between November 2012 and April 2013 (100% response rate). Costs of the scheme were established from local budget and activity data. The scheme was likely to achieve a mean net benefit of £1568 per person from a local government and National Health Service (NHS) perspective and £3766 from the perspective of the individual. An expenditure of £2851 per person accrued to central government for the additional redistribution of benefit payments to older people.

"From providers and insurers to governments and consumers, it appears that everybody is talking about market competition in health care. However, what do they actually mean? Are they talking about the same things? These questions are relevant for health systems consisting of policy networks, such as in the Netherlands. In policy networks, different actors (besides the government) are engaged in policy-making. Based on their particular frame ('mode of interpretation'), actors proceed and, from this, give meaning to the concept of market competition. Since there are differences in frames (of reference) among the various actors, it is important to understand what market competition means from the perspective of each network participant. This study, with regard to the Dutch health care system, demonstrates 'market competition' as a broad concept, relating to 13 different frames. Only four frames (i.e. cost control, deregulation, competition and increased power) are shared by a maximum of two (out of a total of four) network participants. Clearly, there are differences in the meanings and underlying frames about market competition amongst the key players.

"Health care costs in general, and prescription drug costs in particular, are rapidly rising. Between 1996 and 2007 the average annual per capita health care cost is projected to increase from dollar 3,781 to dollar 7,100. [AQ1] The single leading component of health care cost is the cost of prescription drugs (currently 10% of total health care spending, projected to become 18% in 2008). The average cost per drug increased 40% during the 1993-1998 period. Forty-one million Americans have no health insurance, and those who have, have inadequate prescription drug coverage. [AQ2] To cope with this situation, many consumers are trying to economize by doing without the prescriptions or the appropriate doses, buying generics or medicines from Canada or Mexico, or splitting pills of higher doses to take advantage of the pricing policy of drug manufacturers. Some of these approaches are medically and/or legally acceptable, while some are dubious.

"There are indications that the treatment costs arising from obesity are significant. However, the cost-of-illness studies undertaken to data also highlight two other important points. First, the cost of treatment in sensitive to the body mass index (BMI) cut-off used. Given that there is no definitive definition of obesity as based on BMI, a range of costs reflecting differing BMI cut-offs may be more appropriate than the use of a single figure. Second, the costs are, not surprisingly, also sensitive to the defined associated diseases. Again there is little agreement on these and also little information on the relative risks of attributable diseases arising from obesity. The calculations of the cost-of-illness arising from the treatment of obesity, and its associated conditions must, therefore, remain indicative rather than authoritative.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011612,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9246835/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To explore dimensions and varieties of economic evaluations that healthcare decision-makers do or do not use.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Web-based survey.
    


          Setting and participants:
        
      
      A purposive sample of Australian healthcare decision-makers was recruited by direct invitation through email. All were invited to complete an online questionnaire derived from the EUROMET 2004 survey.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 91 questionnaires were analysed. Almost all participants were involved in financial resource allocations. Most commonly, participants based their decisions on patient needs, effectiveness of interventions, cost of interventions or overall budgetary effect, and policy directives. Evidence from cost-effectiveness analysis was used by half of the participants. Timing, ethical issues and lack of knowledge about economic evaluation were the most significant barriers to the use of economic evaluations in resource allocation decisions. Most participants reported being moderately to very familiar with the cost-effectiveness analysis. There was a general impression that evidence from economic evaluations should play a larger role in the future.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Evidence from health economic evaluations may provide valuable information in some decisions; however, at present, it is not central to many decisions. The study suggests that, for economic evaluation to be helpful in real-life policy decisions, it has to be placed into context - a context which is complex, political and often resistant to voluntary change.",https://doi.org/10.1071/ah10890,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21871187/,economics
"This paper describes how economists view resource allocation decisions in health care markets. The basic economic decisions that must be made in any economic system and the resource allocation decisions in a perfectly competitive market are described. An idealized market can achieve an efficient allocation of resources and is contrasted with a more realistic description of the numerous ways in which health care markets depart from the perfectly competitive ideal. The implications of these departures for health care policy are discussed, along with key controversies concerning reliance upon markets for resource allocation in health care. In particular, the failure of competitive markets to achieve what many consider an equitable distribution of health care is emphasized. The paper concludes with some practical observations on how pharmacists can use the increasing emphasis on economic efficiency to the advantage of their profession.",https://doi.org/10.1592/phco.20.16.333s.35011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11034062/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      This paper is a response to the suggestion by Sacristán et al that clinicians can increase their clinical freedom by undertaking individualised economic analyses that demonstrate that interventions, which at a population level do not reach conventional thresholds of cost-effectiveness, do so in particular patients.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      In this reply, I question the presumption that ""clinical freedom"" is necessarily desirable and go on to argue that, even if it is, the proposal that clinicians should do individualised economic evaluation is flawed. Firstly, the additional clinical choice that may be gained from individualised economic analyses that demonstrate that an intervention, generally considered not to be cost-effective, is cost-effective in a particular patient, is likely to be counterbalanced by other analyses that produce the converse result (i.e. that an intervention that is cost-effective at a population level may not be so in a particular patient)--a complementary consequence, which is ignored by Sacristán et al in their paper. Secondly, the skills and time required to do an individualised economic analysis are likely to exceed those of most clinicians. Thirdly, and most importantly, asking clinicians to make rationing judgements at the point of care is a threat to patient trust and can harm the doctor-patient relationship.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Individualised economic evaluations are neither a desirable nor feasible method for increasing clinical choice.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-10-184,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20584278/,economics

"In the past years, the expenditure for cancer drugs has quickly increased, especially for biologic agents. Pharmaceutical companies and national health systems have different approaches in handling the issue of drug reimbursement. Companies support a price based on research and development (R&D) expenditures including those for unsuccessful drug projects while national health systems generally argue that pricing should be based on the incremental benefit generated by the agent under examination (value-based pricing - VBP). Nevertheless, current oncologic drugs prices are too high and not really justified by their incremental benefits or innovation, nor can they demonstrate that higher thresholds in QALYs could bring wider societal benefits. In this article we discuss these two points of view in the light of the most recent national and international literature. In Italy, drug reimbursement is currently managed through a mixed approach between the recognition of R&D expenditures and VBP. Reimbursement is also integrated with post-marketing patient-based national registries, particularly in the field of anti-cancer agents, that provide rebates based on financial risk sharing, cost-sharing, payment by results and success fee methods.",https://doi.org/10.1701/2218.23928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27093327/,economics
"Background and purpose:
        
      
      Decisions in planning radiotherapy facilities in countries with limited financial resources require information on economic factors to make provision for sustainability. This study aims at acquiring data on some of these factors involved in delivery of teletherapy in 11 countries of different economic status.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Representatives of three European, one African, three Latin American and four Asian countries, were identified from radiation oncology institutions that operated both cobalt and linac teletherapy machines. Productivity data were prospectively collected for the year 2002. A detailed log was recorded for each machine over an arbitrary two-week period. Data on quality assurance (QA), maintenance, the capital costs of each machine, and the source replacement costs for the cobalt units were also recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both linear accelerators and cobalt machines treat more than 10,000 fractions per year per machine with 2.5 and 2.3 fields per fraction, respectively. The capital costs of the machines vary considerably, with a factor of more than 10 for linear accelerators. Cobalt sources show a huge variation in price. The median costs of QA and maintenance of a linac was US$ 41,000 compared to US$ 6000 for cobalt machines. This results for the economic factors considered in median costs per fraction of US$ 11.02 for linear accelerators and US$ 4.87 for cobalt machines. These figures do not include the costs for physicians.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The variation of the costs per fraction is more due to the result of differences in machine usage and costs of equipment than of national economic status. A treatment fraction on a linac with functionality comparable to cobalt, costs 50% more than cobalt therapy.

"Public drug expenditure has increased in Sweden over the past 5 years, primarily because of increased spending on new and more expensive drugs. This increase has placed greater pressure on the existing pharmaceutical reimbursement system, and in turn there has been a tendency for government to increase the level of regulation of this system in order to improve its efficiency and to control costs. Plans to reform the reimbursement system are being formulated both in terms of financing and patient co-payment (cost sharing) for prescription drugs. If these plans are implemented, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals will be transferred from the Swedish National Social Insurance Board to the country councils, thus ending the open-ended public insurance scheme for prescription drugs and integrating this expenditure within the global healthcare budget for each council. A number of issues will need to be resolved if this transfer takes place, however, not the least of which will be the regulation of cost sharing. In this article, the consequences of cost sharing and the impact of 5 different models for patient co-payment for prescription drugs are analysed and compared with the present reimbursement system in Sweden.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199600102-00011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10163438/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The German Social Act V section sign 12 is aimed towards competition, efficiency and quality in healthcare. Because surgical departments are billing standard diagnosis-related group (DRG) case costs to health insurance companies, they claim best value for money for internal services. Thus, anaesthesia concepts are being closely scrutinized. The present analysis was performed to gain economic arguments for the strategic positioning of regional anaesthesia procedures into clinical pathways.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Surgical procedures, which in 2005 had a relevant caseload in Germany, were chosen in which regional anaesthesia procedures (alone or in combination with general anaesthesia) could routinely be used. The structure of costs and earnings for hospital services, split by types and centres of cost, as well as by underlying procedures are contained in the annually updated public accessible dataset (DRG browser) of the German Hospital Reimbursement Institute (InEK). For the year 2005 besides own data, national anaesthesia staffing costs are available from the German Society of Anaesthesiology (DGAI). The curve of earnings per DRG can be calculated from the 2005 InEK browser. This curve intersects by the cost curve at the point of national mean length of stay. The cost curve was calculated by process-oriented distribution of cost centres over the length of stay and allows benchmarking within the national competitive environment. For comparison of process times data from our local database were used. While the InEK browser lacks process times, the cost positions 5.1-5.3 (staffing costs anaesthesia) and the national structure adjusted anaesthesia staffing costs 2005 as published by the DGAI, were used to calculate nationwide mean available anaesthesia times which were compared with own process times.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Within the portfolio diagram of lengths of stay for each DRG and process times most procedures are located in the economic lower left, in particular those with high case mix (length of stay and anaesthesia times below reimbursement relevant national mean). The driver of increased earnings is shortening length of stay. Our use of regional anaesthesia is 5 to 10-fold higher than national benchmarks and may contribute to our advantageous position in national competition. The annual increases in profit per DRG range between EUR 1,706 and EUR 467,359 and compensate by far the investment of regional anaesthesia derived pain management, besides the advantage of increased patient satisfaction and avoidance of complications.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Regional anaesthesia is a considerable value driver in clinical pathways by shortening length of stay. The present analysis further demonstrates that time for regional block performance is covered by anaesthesia reimbursement within the DRG costing schedule.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-009-1539-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19384453/,economics

"There are three known criteria that underlie drug reimbursement decisions: therapeutic value, cost-effectiveness, and burden of disease. However, evidence from recent reimbursement decisions in several jurisdictions points to residual, unexplained variables, among which is budget impact. Budget impact refers to the total costs that drug reimbursement and use entail with respect to one part of the health care system, pharmaceutical care, or to the entire health care system, taking into account the possible reallocation of resources across budgets or sectors of the health care system. The economic and equity rationale for carrying out budget impact analyses is opportunity cost, or benefits forgone, measured in terms of utility or equitable distribution, by using resources in one way rather than another. In other words, by choosing to draw down the budget in one way, decision makers forgo other opportunities to use the same resources. Under a set of unrealistic assumptions, cost-effectiveness analysis accounts for opportunity cost while conveying to the decision maker the price of maximizing health gains, subject to a budget or resource constraint. However, the underlying assumptions are implausible, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical care. Moreover, budget impact analysis is more useful to the decision maker than cost-effectiveness analysis if the objective is not to maximize health gains subject to a budget or resource constraint, but to reduce variance in health gains. With respect to equitable distribution, budget impact analyses lay bare the individuals or groups who lose out - those who bear the opportunity cost of spending resources in accordance with one decision rule rather than another.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2007-054,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18325899/,economics

"Many countries have cost sharing schemes in health insurance to control health care expenditures. The Dutch basic health insurance includes a mandatory deductible of currently 385 euros per adult per year. To avoid affordability problems, several municipalities offer a group contract for low-income people in which the mandatory deductible is 'reinsured'. More specifically, this means that out-of-pocket spending under the deductible is covered by supplementary insurance. By comparing groups with and without the reinsurance option, this study examines whether low-income people are price-sensitive when it comes to pharmaceutical spending. We use a unique dataset from a Dutch health insurer with anonymized individual insurance claims for the period 2014-2017. The data allows for a clean difference-in-difference analysis as it contains both municipalities without reinsurance and municipalities that introduced reinsurance on January 1st 2017. We find that the introduction of reinsurance led to a statistically significant increase in pharmaceutical spending of 16% in the first quarter of 2017 and 7% in the second quarter. For the second half of 2017 the effect is small and not statistically significant. This study adds to the evidence that low-income people are indeed price-sensitive when it comes to pharmaceutical spending.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.07.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31378537/,economics
"The policy community generally has assumed Medicare Advantage (MA) plans negotiate hospital payment rates similar to those for commercial insurance products and well above those in traditional Medicare. After surveying senior hospital and health plan executives, we found, however, that MA plans nominally pay only 100-105 percent of traditional Medicare rates and, in real economic terms, possibly less. Respondents broadly identified three primary reasons for near-payment equivalence: statutory and regulatory provisions that limit out-of-network payments to traditional Medicare rates, de facto budget constraints that MA plans face because of the need to compete with traditional Medicare and other MA plans, and a market equilibrium that permits relatively lower MA rates as long as commercial rates remain well above the traditional Medicare rates. We explored a number of policy implications not only for the MA program but also for the problem of high and variable hospital prices in commercial insurance markets.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26240241/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Diagnosis related groups (DRGs) are a well-established provider payment system. Because of their imminent potential of cost reduction, they have been widely introduced. In addition to cost cutting, several social objectives - e.g., improving overall health care quality - feed into the DRG system.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The WHO compared different provider payment systems with regard to the following objectives: prevention of further health problems, providing services and solving health problems, and responsiveness to people's legitimate expectations. However, no study has been published which takes the impact of different cost accounting systems across the DRG systems into account.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We compared the impact of different cost accounting methods within DRG-like systems by developing six criteria: integration of patients' health risk into pricing practice, incentives for quality improvement and innovation, availability of high class evidence based therapy, prohibition of economically founded exclusions, reduction of fragmentation incentives, and improvement of patient oriented treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We set up a first overview of potential and actual impacts of the pricing practices within Yale-DRGs, AR-DRGs, G-DRGs, Swiss AP-DRGs adoption and Swiss MIPP. It could be demonstrated that DRGs are not only a 'homogenous' group of similar provider payment systems but quite different by fulfilling major health care objectives connected with the used cost accounting methods.

"Background:
        
      
      Technological progress has led to changes in the antenatal screening programmes, most significantly the introduction of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). The availability of a new type of testing changes the type of information that the parent(s) require before, during and after screening to mitigate anxiety about the testing process and results.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To identify the extent to which economic evaluations of NIPT have accounted for the need to provide information alongside testing and the associated costs and health outcomes of information provision.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of economic evaluations of NIPTs (up to February 2018) was conducted. Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsychINFO were searched using an electronic search strategy combining a published economic search filter (from NHS economic evaluations database) with terms related to NIPT and screening-related technologies. Data were extracted using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards framework and the results were summarised as part of a narrative synthesis.
    


          Results:

Two studies considered the impact of test results on parents' quality of life by allowing utility decrements for different outcomes.

"Aims:
        
      
      In Sweden approximately 3% of annual births are conceived using assisted reproductive technologies (ART). In light of increasing use of ART in Sweden we estimate the lifetime future tax revenues of a child conceived by in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to establish whether public subsidy of IVF represents sound fiscal policy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A modified generational accounting model was developed to calculate the net present value (NPV) of average investment costs required to achieve an IVF-conceived child. The model simulates direct lifetime financial interactions between the child and the Swedish government. Within the model we assume average direct financial transfers are made to the individual (eg, child allowance, education, health care, pension, etc). In return, the individual transfers resources to the government through taxation based on anticipated average earnings. The difference between direct transfers and gross taxes paid equals the net-tax contribution. Individual tax contributions were held constant in the model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Based on average life-expectancy an individual born in 2005 will pay an undiscounted 32.5 million SEK in taxes to the Swedish government and receive 20.9 million SEK in direct financial transfers over their lifetime. When these figures are discounted and IVF costs are included in the analysis we obtain a lifetime NPV of 254,000 SEK with a break-even point at age 41 (the age of achieving a positive NPV) for an individual conceived through IVF.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Based on results presented here we conclude that State-funded IVF in Sweden does not negatively impact the long run fiscal budget. Conversely, over an average lifetime an IVF offspring returns a positive net value to the State.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494808095086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19004901/,economics
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      To review the changes in the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery in the last few decades.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Cataract surgery is the commonly performed procedure and it has evolved through various techniques, namely extracapsular cataract extraction, phacoemulsification and small or microincision cataract surgery. In this article we have reviewed the healthcare variant analysis, mainly the cost-effectiveness and cost utility over the past few years.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Cost-effectiveness implies the economic analysis of relative costs and practical outcomes after cataract surgery. Cost utility is typically in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-utility values for cataract surgery for first eye varied from US$245 to US$22000/QALY in Western countries and from US$9 to US$1600 in developing countries. There are two methods that have been used to calculate the cost utility namely the costs that are discounted at 3% for 12 years and discounted at 3% for 5 years.",https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0b013e3283414f64,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21088579/,economics
"An economic evaluation of capsulotomy for posterior capsular opacification after extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was carried out using a cost minimization model. This model demonstrates the use of cost comparison to aid the decision making process. A flow-chart of capsulotomy mode, with associated complications, is illustrated. Costs of complications are calculated using assigned probability for each tree. Overall comparative costs are displayed graphically Further, the model is presented using a computer-assisted spreadsheet with an added calculation program. Variables can therefore be adjusted with instantaneous outcomes visually displayed. We present several examples with different sets of variables and find that, in most instances, YAG capsulotomy is a more economical option than surgical capsulotomy. This finding is a relevant finding in planning for eye health programs, particularly in developing countries.

"This paper draws on data from Sierra Leone, and secondary data from elsewhere, to show that the rural poor can be disproportionately disadvantaged by user charges for health care, paying a higher percentage of their incomes for health care than wealthier households. Cost sharing systems at primary care level should include exemptions for the poor, but rarely succeed in consistently protecting them. The regressivity of health expenditures also results from lack of protection from the higher costs of less-frequently used, expensive providers. In Sierra Leone, the burden of curative treatment costs for all groups came mainly from private and NGO providers. Proximity to facilities appeared a more important factor in their use than average price levels. Even if a perfect exemption system existed at government primary care facilities, it would not have had much overall effect because of their relatively small contribution to household health expenditures. The financial burden on households could be relieved by making basic health facilities more accessible and at hospital level using additional resources generated through improved efficiency and cross-subsidization to provide exemptions. Also, pricing policy should take into account local economic conditions. Insurance/prepayment schemes covering the cost of hospitalization would come closer to an ideal solution, but have been implemented in very few of the poorer countries.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1751(199907/09)14:3<179::aid-hpm548>3.0.co;2-n,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10623188/,economics

"Aim:
        
      
      Prescription drug prices in the United States are considered rather extreme. Americans spend over $460 billion on drugs annually, or almost 17 percent of total national healthcare spending. How innovation incentives and insurance coverage drive pricing, diffusion, and utilization of drugs, under conditions of risk and competition, are multi-dimensional issues in medical economics that remain under-explored in the current empirical literature. We seek to address these issues in reviewing relevant studies presented at the 2020 AEA-ASSA annual convention.
    


          Approach:
        
      
      Drawn from the 2020 convention panel sessions devoted to health economics, empirical evidence was thematically analyzed for charted new research terrains and trajectories. Their theoretical and practical implications on efficiency, effectiveness, and value in drug production and consumption were then identified.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      With certain qualifications, evidence confirms price inelasticity of prescription drugs and medical treatments, along with substitution effects from high or continuously rising prices. While health insurance induces ex ante moral hazard, albeit on a larger scale than previously considered, losing dependent coverage can incentivize price-substitution to risky and illegal drugs, including those sold on the black market. At the firm level, drug patenting and exclusivity rights suggest that innovation incentives increase new or novel clinical trials and generic utilization to a considerable extent. But innovation can produce strong, offsetting effects. It can distort competition and cause (at times sharp) price increases from product-hopping, (compensatory) list pricing, industry mergers and acquisitions, and capture of positive spillovers by competitors, rather than by focal developers, in follow-on innovations. In fine, there remains room for opportunism among firms, particularly market incumbents, and many loopholes are unplugged by U.S. healthcare reform. These make drug utilization costly to the insured, and risky to those who are - or become - uninsured or underinsured for various reasons.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The fundamental disconnect between innovation cost and drug pricing demands public attention and policy intervention, which have proved largely elusive to date. Gaming the system in the name of scientific invention and discovery to reap additional benefits, at the expense of consumer health and income, brings to question the offsetting benefits of firm innovation. It also raises separate issues of fairness and equity. Innovation needs to be considered from the perspective of value lines and beyond conventional marketing incentives to drug utilization, with or without insurance coverage. Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses figure prominently under a value-based system of resource allocation, insurance, medical prescription, purchasing, and reimbursement.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2020.1772797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32432950/,economics
"Periods of economic downturn place special demands on the plastic surgeon whose practice involves a large amount of cosmetic surgery. When determining strategy during difficult economic times, it is useful to understand the macroeconomic background of these downturns and to draw lessons from businesses in other service industries. Business cycles and monetary policy determine the overall environment in which plastic surgery is practiced. Plastic surgeons can take both defensive and proactive steps to maintain their profits during recessions and to prepare for the inevitable upturn. Care should also be taken when selecting pricing strategy during economic slowdowns.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.prs.0000024455.05419.db,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12360083/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Economic tools have been used in the past to predict the trends in plastic surgery procedures. Since 1992, U.S. cosmetic surgery volumes have increased overall, but the exact relationship between economic downturns and procedural volumes remains elusive. If an economic predicting role can be established from plastic surgery indicators, this could prove to be a very powerful tool.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A rolling 3-month revenue average of an eight-plastic surgeon practice and various economic indicators were plotted and compared. An investigation of the U.S. procedural volumes was performed from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons statistics between 1996 and 2008. The correlations of different economic variables with plastic surgery volumes were evaluated. Lastly, search term frequencies were examined from 2004 to July of 2009 to study potential patient interest in major plastic surgery procedures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The self-payment revenue of the plastic surgery group consistently proved indicative of the market trends approximately 1 month in advance. The Standard and Poor's 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, and Standard and Poor's Retail Index demonstrated a very close relationship with the income of our plastic surgery group. The frequency of Internet search terms showed a constant level of interest in the patient population despite economic downturns.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The data demonstrate that examining plastic surgery revenue can be a useful tool to analyze and possibly predict trends, as it is driven by a market and shows a close correlation to many leading economic indicators. The persisting and increasing interest in plastic surgery suggests hope for a recovering and successful market in the near future.",https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e3181de248b,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20679849/,economics
"The principal aim of this paper is to estimate a stochastic frontier cost function and an inefficiency effects model in the analysis of the primary health-care services purchased by the public authority and supplied by 180 providers in 1996 in Catalonia. The evidence from our sample does not support the premise that contracting out has helped improve purchasing cost efficiency in primary care. Inefficient purchasing cost was observed in the component of this purchasing cost explicitly included in the contract between purchaser and provider. There were no observable incentives for the contracted-out primary health-care teams to minimise prescription costs, which were not explicitly included in the contracting system.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.883,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15386681/,economics
"This paper attempts to examine the heterogeneity in the public financing of long-term care (LTC) and the wide-ranging instruments in place to finance LTC services. We distinguish and classify the institutional responses to the need for LTC financing as ex ante (occurring prior to when the need arises, such as insurance) and ex post (occurring after the need arises, such as public sector and family financing). Then, we examine country-specific data to ascertain whether the two types of financing are complements or substitutes. Finally, we examine exploratory cross-national data on public expenditure determinants, specifically economic, demographic and social determinants. We show that although both ex ante and ex post mechanisms exist in all countries with advanced industrial economies and despite the fact that instruments are different across countries, ex ante and ex post instruments are largely substitutes for each other. Expenditure estimates to date indicate that the public financing of LTC is highly sensitive to a country's income, ageing of the population and the availability of informal caregiving.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25760582/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      To calculate the cost of assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment cycles and resultant live-birth events.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Cost-outcome study based on a decision analysis model of significant clinical and economic outcomes of ART.
    


          Setting and participants:
        
      
      All non-donor ART treatments initiated in Australia in 2002. Treatment cycles, maternal age and birth outcome data were obtained from the Australian and New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database. Direct health care costs were obtained from fertility centres, and included government, private insurer and patient costs.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Average health care cost of non-donor, fresh and frozen embryo ART treatment cycles. Average and age-specific costs per live-birth event following ART treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Average health care cost per non-donor ART live-birth event was 32,903 US dollars (range, 24,809 US dollars for women < 30 years to 97,884 US dollars for women > or = 40 years). The cost per live birth for women aged > or = 42 years was 182,794 US dollars. The average treatment cost of a fresh cycle was 6,940 US dollars, compared with 1,937 US dollars for a frozen embryo transfer cycle.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Debate regarding funding for ART services has been hindered by a lack of economic studies of ART treatments and outcomes in Australia. This is the most comprehensive costing study of ART services to date in terms of resources consumed during ART treatment. It confirms that ART treatment is less cost-effective in older women.

"In the stock market, return reversal occurs when investors sell overbought stocks and buy oversold stocks, reversing the stocks' price trends. In this paper, we develop a new method to identify key drivers of return reversal by incorporating a comprehensive set of factors derived from different economic theories into one unified dynamical Bayesian factor graph. We then use the model to depict factor relationships and their dynamics, from which we make some interesting discoveries about the mechanism behind return reversals. Through extensive experiments on the US stock market, we conclude that among the various factors, the liquidity factors consistently emerge as key drivers of return reversal, which is in support of the theory of liquidity effect. Specifically, we find that stocks with high turnover rates or high Amihud illiquidity measures have a greater probability of experiencing return reversals. Apart from the consistent drivers, we find other drivers of return reversal that generally change from year to year, and they serve as important characteristics for evaluating the trends of stock returns. Besides, we also identify some seldom discussed yet enlightening inter-factor relationships, one of which shows that stocks in Finance and Insurance industry are more likely to have high Amihud illiquidity measures in comparison with those in other industries. These conclusions are robust for return reversals under different thresholds.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0167050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27893780/,economics
"The time available to medical students for learning is scarce in relation to the knowledge they are asked to absorb. New material should not therefore be added to medical curricula without careful consideration of the benefits of the extra knowledge compared to the costs of obtaining this knowledge. In this paper a justification for integrating economic principles into medical education is presented. It would benefit society by encouraging the practice of efficient medicine, and benefit students by giving them the ability to absorb the growing economic content of the medical literature and by encouraging an appreciation of why economic factors will influence their clinical decision-making. These benefits would accrue at little cost because only a limited number of economic concepts need to be absorbed by medical students. The critical concepts are outlined and some of the obstacles to students applying this knowledge in practice are considered. The paper concludes by suggesting that the impact of teaching economics to medical students should be evaluated, but this will require further research into ways of evaluating the outcome of medical education programmes in general.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.1989.tb00811.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2927341/,economics

"Much evidence points to the fact that managed care plans (health maintenance organizations and preferred provider insurance) reduce costs and offer value for money. Yet they apparently have not helped to slow national health expenditures. One explanation is that the practices of purchasers (including government and employers), the tax laws, and other market imperfections have reduced the demand for real cost containment, depriving managed care plans of an adequate incentive to cut cost and price. These market conditions can and should be corrected; the managed competition proposal being discussed at the national level is a comprehensive plan for doing so.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.12.3.27,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8244240/,economics

Adopting the principles of mathematical expectation, the model estimates the expected total costs of adopting each of the several strategies concerning the cash balance that the organization might maintain. Expected total costs consist of anticipated short costs, resulting from a potential shortage of funds. Long costs are associated with a potential surplus of funds and an opportunity cost represented by foregone investment income. Of importance to the model is the potential for the health service organization to realize a surplus of funds during periods characterized by a net cash disbursement.

"The recent Food and Drug Administration approval of drotrecogin alfa (activated) and the potential of several other new therapies may represent the beginning of a breakthrough in the management of critical illness in the intensive care unit. However, their use in clinical practice will likely be dependent on a rigorous appraisal not only of their effects, but also of their costs. Novel therapies can no longer be judged simply by their effectiveness in treating illness, but must also be evaluated on an institutional and societal level on the basis of their cost. These considerations have important implications for the practicing intensivist, who will need to better understand the conduct and design of economic evaluations, including their strengths and weaknesses.

"Objective:
        
      
      To decompose drug spending in Sweden between the years 1990 and 2000. This paper updates a previous study, which looked at the period 1990-1995, by providing an additional 5 years of data (1995-2000) and extending the previous analysis in a number of ways.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The paper builds on the earlier work that showed that changes in drug spending could be decomposed into three components: price, quantity and a residual. The size of the residual is a measure of the impact of changes in drug treatment patterns on drug spending. The data set used in this paper was collected from Apoteket AB (The National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies) and was based on comprehensive information (inpatients as well as outpatients) on drug deliveries from wholesalers to pharmacies. Data were obtained for aggregate drug spending (from 1990-2000) and for spending according to anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system group.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Real drug spending increased by 119% during the study period. The residual rose by 67% indicating the switch from cheaper to more innovative and expensive drug therapies was a major cost driver. Real drug spending would have increased by about 31% if there had been no changes in treatment patterns. The second driver of drug spending was the quantity of drugs consumed, which increased by 41%. The main reason for the larger quantity sold appears to be increases in the intensity of medication in terms of defined daily doses per patient, rather than a larger number of patients starting drug treatment. Real prices decreased during the 10-year study period. We found large differences between ATC groups in terms of spending growth. The ATC groups that have contributed the most to the increase in spending are: drugs that affect the CNS (N), the alimentary tract and metabolism (A) and the cardiovascular system (C), which are also the three largest groups in terms of sales. For all three groups, it was the residual that mainly drove costs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study indicates very clearly that the main driving force behind the increase in drug costs in Sweden between 1990 and 2000 was the change in drug therapy from old to new and more innovative and expensive drug therapies. This shows the importance of carrying out economic evaluations of new more costly drugs in order to make an assessment of the social benefits of a switch from a cheaper to a more expensive drug.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200422010-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14720080/,economics
"We applied a battery of cointegration tests comprising those of Johansen and Juselius [19], Phillips and Hansen [35], and Engle and Granger [6], to model aggregate health care expenditure using 1960-96 US data. The existence of a stable long-run economic relationship or cointegration is confirmed, in the United States, between aggregate health care expenditure and real GDP, population age distribution, managed care enrollment, number of practicing physicians, and government deficits. The evidence of cointegration among these variables, chosen on the theoretical basis of prior studies, implies that while they are individually non-stationary in levels, together they are highly correlated and move, in the long run to form an economic equilibrium relationship of US aggregate health care expenditure. More specifically, and for the first time in this line of inquiry, (i) managed care enrollment is found to be negatively associated with the level of health care spending, (ii) supply disinduced demand effects of physicians tend to moderate health expenditure, and (iii) government deficit financing is positively related to health care spending.

"Objective:
        
      
      To measure variation in payment rates under Medicare's Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) and identify the main payment adjustments that drive variation.
    


          Data sources/study setting:
        
      
      Medicare cost reports for all Medicare-certified hospitals, 1987-2013, and Dartmouth Atlas geographic files.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      We measure the Medicare payment rate as a hospital's total acute inpatient Medicare Part A payment, divided by the standard IPPS payment for its geographic area. We assess variation using several measures, both within local markets and nationally. We perform a factor decomposition to identify the share of variation attributable to specific adjustments. We also describe the characteristics of hospitals receiving different payment rates and evaluate changes in the magnitude of the main adjustments over time.
    


          Data collection/extraction methods:
        
      
      Data downloaded from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and the Dartmouth Atlas.
    


          Principal findings:
        
      
      In 2013, Medicare paid for acute inpatient discharges at a rate 31 percent above the IPPS base. For the top 10 percent of discharges, the mean rate was double the IPPS base. Variations were driven by adjustments for medical education and care to low-income populations. The magnitude of variation has increased over time.

We discuss how, by extracting the dependency structure of financial equities, a network approach can be used to build a well-diversified portfolio that effectively reduces investment risk. We find that investments in stocks that occupy peripheral, poorly connected regions in financial filtered networks, namely Minimum Spanning Trees and Planar Maximally Filtered Graphs, are most successful in diversifying, improving the ratio between returns' average and standard deviation, reducing the likelihood of negative returns, while keeping profits in line with the general market average even for small baskets of stocks.

"Good governance promotes the fundamental grounds of participation and democracy in contemporary public administration, whilst institution building and the (in)effectiveness of public administration is linked to economic growth. This synergy brings forth sheer implications on the sustainable economic development. On this composite setting, the paper examines several fundamental credentials of public administration in the European Union (EU) countries, in relation to economic development, but also poverty, research, and development support, as representative socio-economic credentials. The empirical analysis is based on data covering the 1995-2017 lapse of time, processed through three econometric procedures, namely robust regression, structural equation modeling, and Gaussian graphical models. The main results emphasize that there are significant joint implications of public administration on the considered socio-economic dimensions. General government spending and, particularly, the environmental support, have positive implications on the European Union economies, leading to significant increases in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and downsize in poverty risk (more emphasized in regard to the government expenditures than the environmental protection).

"Priority setting is inevitable on the path towards universal health coverage. All countries experience a gap between their population's health needs and what is economically feasible for governments to provide. Can priority setting ever be fair and ethically acceptable? Fairness requires that unmet health needs be addressed, but in a fair order. Three criteria for priority setting are widely accepted among ethicists: cost-effectiveness, priority to the worse-off, and financial risk protection. Thus, a fair health system will expand coverage for cost-effective services and give extra priority to those benefiting the worse-off, whilst at the same time providing high financial risk protection. It is considered unacceptable to treat people differently according to their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, social status, or place of residence. Inequalities in health outcomes associated with such personal characteristics are therefore unfair and should be minimized. This commentary also discusses a third group of contested criteria, including rare diseases, small health benefits, age, and personal responsibility for health, subsequently rejecting them. In conclusion, countries need to agree on criteria and establish transparent and fair priority setting processes.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-016-0624-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27170046/,economics
"The previous two sessions of this Symposium have dealt with incentives for cost-effective provider behaviour. Although incentive-reimbursement, which rewards the providers for delivery medical care in a cost-effective way, can be an important step towards a cost-effective health care system, it is not rewards the providers for delivering medical care in a cost-effective way, can be an important step towards a cost-effective health care system, it is not sufficient. As long as the insured consumers have both comprehensive health insurance coverage and freedom of choice of provider, providers will have great difficulty in resisting consumers' demand for ever more costly medical care, and politicians or other decision-makers will have great difficulty in restricting capacity and in preventing overcapacity. Fear of losing patients or voters might dominate. Therefore, in this session we shall focus on the key role of health insurance in a cost-effective health care system and on consumer incentives and insurer behaviour. If the consumers have a choice between several provider-insurer organizations. Although market forces do play an important role in a competitive health-care system, competition should not be confused with a ""free market"". Besides financial arrangements to protect the poor, pro-competitive regulation is needed to guarantee a ""fair competition"". Currently there is much consensus that the present Dutch health insurance system, in which 60% of the population is publicly insured and 40% is privately insured, should be replaced by a national health insurance scheme, which uniformly applies to the entire population. A few years ago, I made a proposal for such a scheme, which was based largely on the ideas of Ellwood, McClure, and Enthoven on competition between alternative delivery systems. The main features of this proposal will be discussed.

Hospital mergers may also affect price bargaining. I estimate that all three types of hospitals capture higher markups than other providers.

Government could assume the role of reinsurer, by assuming responsibility for most of the costs of people who are in the highest 2-3 percent of the national spending distribution. This would spread the burden of costs of very-high-cost persons to the broad population base and could cause premiums to fall as carriers spend less on efforts to avoid adverse selection.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w2.380,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12703597/,economics
"The purpose of this article is to examine 10 steps analyzing the financial impact on a periodontal practice accepting a proposed managed care dental plan. It is emphasized that this analysis should be conducted before formally agreeing to accept the proposed plan. The procedures for examining the 10 steps include the use of hypothetical data for a periodontal practice confronted with a discounted fee plan. Each step is identified, discussed, and the hypothetical data are used to develop results presented in a set of tables. The steps in the analysis process include constructing a practice profit and loss statement and developing a dataset of practice characteristics and productivity measures. Other estimates should be made of covered lives, new patient utilization, existing patient utilization, utilization of non-covered services, estimating other sources of revenue and expense, and the impact on capacity utilization of operatories and practice staff. Results are presented in a set of analysis tables. The importance of multiple analyses is discussed as is the importance of analyzing the impact on results from changing assumptions. Some of the higher risk variables faced by the practitioner are identified for submission to risk evaluation to examine the sensitivity of results. Finally, the relationship between the proposed plan and the additional time required by the periodontist to meet the plan's specifications is examined in light of the data developed in the 10 steps and the results tables.",https://doi.org/10.1902/jop.1998.69.2.241,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9526924/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Both the preventive and curative healthcare provisions accumulate agents' health stock and stimulate economies' productivities. However, with limited medical resources, increases in preventive health expenditure crowd out curative expenditure, and vice versa, which in turn impairs the population's health and deters economic growth. This research aims to provide a empirically rigorous test on the hypothesis that optimally allocating health expenditure between prevention and cures stimulates economic growth within different countries, especially developed countries, and investigates whether health services are luxury goods on the path of economic development.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on OECD country experiences, this present study uses the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation method to examine the roles of preventive and curative healthcare services over the path of economic development and proves that preventive and curative health spending have non-linear effects on economic performance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For growth maximization, the optimal share of preventive health expenditure to GDP is 0.44% with per capita GDP at US$40,465; the real share is 0.25% with per capita GDP at US$35,230. The optimal share of curative health expenditure to GDP is 10.96% with per capita GDP at US$41,816; the real share is 8.26% with per capita GDP at US$35,230. Accordingly, the estimated optimal provision of health services are currently underprovided. This research further estimates the effects of income on demand for care and shows that the income elasticities of preventive and curative health care are greater than unity. Health services are luxury goods.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economies with higher incomes demand such services more than those with lower incomes. The large positive effects of income on preventive care use exist.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30403708/,economics
"External price referencing (EPR) is applied more and more frequently worldwide by payers to control pharmaceutical prices. Together with the parallel trade of pharmaceuticals, EPR may result in lower pharmaceutical prices in higher-income countries and higher prices in lower-income countries, which implies that pharmaceutical expenditure grows more rapidly in the latter than in the former group. Our objective was to assess this hypothesis. We used hierarchical linear models on country-level panel data to show that-after controlling for compounding factors such as GDP, the proportion of the old-age population or life expectancy-the annual growth rate of pharmaceutical expenditure was 2.1% points larger in the lower- than in the higher-income members of the European Union between 2000 and 2008. This difference in trends became non-significant (0.6% points) after the onset of the global economic crisis. There was no significant difference between lower- and higher-income countries in the growth rate of non-pharmaceutical health expenditure in either period. Our results indirectly support the presence of price convergence of pharmaceuticals among European countries, and EPR and parallel trade may provide a reasonable explanation to the observed trend difference of pharmaceutical expenditure in the two groups of countries between 2000 and 2008. This higher growth rate of pharmaceutical expenditure put extra burden on public health care budgets in lower-income countries and resulted in disproportionately more cost-containment measures compared to higher-income countries after 2008. It remains to be seen whether the disappearance of the difference in trend growth rates due to special health policy interventions in countries with economic difficulties is temporary or permanent.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czw133,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27697777/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      Several studies document the impact of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in working, aged men. Direct medical costs related to BPH treatment are largely borne by employees through higher premiums. However, indirect costs related to lost work are primarily borne by the employer. In this study we used claims data and absentee records from large employers to estimate the costs associated with BPH in working age males.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We used 2 data sources to examine direct and indirect costs associated with BPH in a privately insured, nonelderly population. Multivariate regression models were used to predict spending for persons with and without a medical claim for BPH, controlling for relevant covariates. Data on work loss were linked to medical claims to estimate work loss related to treatment for BPH.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean annual expenditures were 4,193 dollars for men without a medical claim for BPH. In contrast, annual spending was 5,729 dollars for men with a claim for BPH. Thus, the incremental cost associated with a diagnosis of BPH was 1,536 dollars yearly. Overall the average employee with the condition missed 7.3 hours of work yearly related to BPH with approximately 10% reporting some work loss related to a health care encounter for BPH.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Treatment of men with BPH places a significant burden on employees and their employers through direct medical costs as well as through lost work time. Direct and indirect costs to the private sector related to BPH treatment are estimated to be 3.9 billion dollars.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ju.0000152318.79184.6f,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15758787/,economics

Net present value and internal rate of return calculations for projected costs and returns over a 10-yr period indicate that larger yogurt and cheese processing plants offer the most profitable prospects, whereas a smaller yogurt plant would break even. A smaller cheese plant would have insufficient returns to cover the cost of capital, and fluid milk processing at either scale is economically infeasible.

"Demographic projections to the year 2050 for advanced industrial nations, implying low or negative population growth and a sharp rise in old age dependency, have created concerns about the long-term economic outlook in these countries. An analysis of these projections in the light of the demographic and economic experience of the past century raises doubt about these concerns. There is little empirical evidence that declining population growth has slowed the rate of economic growth. Although the burden of aged dependents will reach a new high, the projected total dependency rate is not out of line with prior experience. Thus, the ability of the working population to shoulder the burden of higher taxes to support programs for older dependents will be greater because of reduced needs to support younger dependents. This conclusion holds for a number of variant projections, the only clear exception being one that implies a mortality revolution at older ages.",https://doi.org/10.1093/geronj/46.6.s299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1940096/,economics

      This paper describes how Ireland created a level playing field for competition in health insurance, the strategies of a major insurer to introduce risk-rated policies that would segment the market, the successful campaign to block these policies, and the policy implications of the European Union requirement of competition in health insurance.
    


          Methods:

"We study the role of health benefits in an employer's compensation strategy, given the overall goal of minimizing total compensation cost (wages plus health-insurance cost). When employees' health status is private information, the employer's basic benefit package consists of a base wage and a moderate health plan, with a generous plan available for an additional charge. We show that in setting the charge for the generous plan, a cost-minimizing employer should act as a monopolist who sells ""health plan upgrades"" to its workers, and we discuss ways tax policy can encourage efficiency under cost-minimization and alternative pricing rules.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2005.03.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16129129/,economics
"Explicit rationing decisions are being made to encompass a wide range of health care issues. Voluntary euthanasia has largely been excluded from this debate due to, in my view, the emotive nature of the issue. Euthanasia is an issue in which economists have been largely excluded and in which ethicists and philosophers dominate. It is the purpose of this paper to review the economic and ethical literature on euthanasia and to discuss their compatibility within the debate on euthanasia. The potential cost savings by the use of advance directives, do-not-resuscitate orders, and futile care withdrawal are then reviewed, as are the potential cost savings created by hospice care. As a conclusion, the ethical and economic arguments are then balanced to assess their compatibility. It is the contention of this paper that reducing medical care costs near the end of life should not be a taboo subject, and that rationing decisions could focus on an exploration of this area and the approaches to it, which are ethically justifiable and economically worthwhile. The introduction of a policy of voluntary euthanasia could have a large impact on the rationing of health care resources whilst also promoting patient choice and an arena for a more dignified death.",https://doi.org/10.1177/095148489701000105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10165372/,economics

"Pharmaceutical expenditure in Ghana accounts for about one-third of the total recurrent costs of the Ministry of Health, but in isolation this figure is a misleading indicator of economic importance. In the primary care sector up to 75-80 percent of the running cost of a health center may be accounted for by pharmaceuticals, and because the Ghanaian currency is heavily overvalued, even these proportions understate the true value of resources used on important drugs. An apparent lack of central control of drugs expenditure led to a study of the existing allocation procedures and prescribing practices. The results suggest large-scale wastage through overprescribing, often in response to patients' preferences for more costly medication. Approaches to improved planning of drug use, including the setting of expenditure norms based on recommended prescribing routines, are detailed, and it is concluded that the resultant savings could allow a sizable extension of the coverage given to rural populations by the primary health care system.",https://doi.org/10.2190/uku9-4xk5-vymg-elb4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7419315/,economics
"In recent years the growth of Medicaid spending has been a serious state budgetary problem. Between 1988 and 1992, state Medicaid expenditures increased at an average annual rate of 21 percent. Even when accounting for funds from special revenue programs, such as provider tax and donation programs, state Medicaid spending increased by 16 percent each year between 1988 and 1992, which is far higher than in previous years. This rapid expenditure growth occurred when states were having economic slowdowns and facing fiscal pressures in many other areas. Using a case study approach, we investigated the strategies used by nine states to address the recent surge in Medicaid spending. Despite fiscal pressures, the states generally avoided large-scale cutbacks in Medicaid. Instead they implemented a wide range of budgetary actions to reduce the effect of Medicaid growth, including increment program cutbacks, constraining other budgetary sectors, shifting program costs to the federal government, and raising state taxes.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-19-4-837,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7860972/,economics
"Methods for measuring and valuing health benefits for economic evaluation and health technology assessment in adult populations are well developed. In contrast, methods for assessing interventions for child and adolescent populations lack detailed guidelines, particularly regarding the valuation of health and quality of life in these age groups. This paper critically examines the methodological considerations involved in the valuation of child- and adolescent-specific health-related quality of life by existing preference-based measures. It also describes the methodological choices made in the valuation of existing generic preference-based measures developed with and/or applied in child and adolescent populations: AHUM, AQoL-6D, CHU9D, EQ-5D-Y, HUI2, HUI3, QWB, 16D and 17D. The approaches used to value existing child- and adolescent-specific generic preference-based measures vary considerably. While the choice of whose preferences and which perspective to use is a matter of normative debate and ultimately for decision by reimbursement agencies and policy makers, greater research around these issues would be informative and would enrich these discussions. Research can also inform the other methodological choices required in the valuation of child and adolescent health states. Gaps in research evidence are identified around the impact of the child described in health state valuation exercises undertaken by adults, including the possibility of informed preferences; the appropriateness and acceptability of valuation tasks for adolescents, in particular tasks involving the state 'dead'; anchoring of adolescent preferences; and the generation and use of combined adult and adolescent preferences.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00873-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31903522/,economics
"Recent commentaries on Medicare Part D highlight both the early failings and the successes of the program. However, regardless of one's opinions about the program, Part D is a reality that millions of Medicare beneficiaries must address now and in the future. The ultimate economic, policy, and clinical success of the Medicare drug benefit plan depends on its transparency and ability to be navigated together by patients, physicians, and other parties. Although Medicare Part D is likely to evolve considerably in the future, it will continue to present elderly adults with numerous plan options and rules and therefore present persistent challenges for patients and physicians. By focusing on a few crucial aspects of Part D and taking advantage of available resources, physicians can simplify Part D for their patients, help them make informed decisions about enrollment and plan selection, and possibly help them save money with their current PDP. This may, in turn, reduce beneficiaries' out-of-pocket prescription costs, thereby improving patients' access to medications and possibly their medication adherence and health outcomes as well.",https://doi.org/10.4065/81.9.1217,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16970218/,economics

In all four cases, society must guard against distinct inequities and injustices, but also in all four, either the particular problem is not inherent in competition or, though inherent, it is not irremediable.

"Objectives:
        
      
      Poor knowledge of eye health, concerns about the cost of spectacles, mistrust of optometrists and limited geographical access in socio-economically deprived areas are barriers to accessing regular eye examinations and result in low uptake and subsequent late presentation to ophthalmology clinics. Personal Medical Services (PMS) were introduced in the late 1990 s to provide locally negotiated solutions to problems associated with inequalities in access to primary care. An equivalent approach to delivery of optometric services could address inequalities in the uptake of eye examinations.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Variations in assumptions were included in the models for equipment and accommodation costs, uptake and length of appointments. The sensitivity analyses thresholds were cost-per-person tested below the GOS1 fee paid by the NHS and achieving break-even between income and expenditure, assuming no cross-subsidy from profits from sales of optical appliances.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Cost per test ranged from £ 24.01 to £ 64.80 and subsidy required varied from £ 14,490 to £ 108,046. Unused capacity utilised for local enhanced service schemes such as glaucoma referral refinement reduced the subsidy needed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In order to support the financial viability of primary eye care in socio-economically deprived communities, income is required from additional subsidies or from sources other than eye examinations, such as ophthalmic or other optometric community services. This would require a significant shift of activity from secondary to primary care locations.

"A primary purpose of health insurance is to protect families from medical expenditure risk. Despite this goal and despite the fact that research has found that Medicaid can crowd out private coverage, little is known about the effect of Medicaid on families' spending patterns. This paper implements a simulated instrumental variables strategy with data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey to estimate the effect of an additional family member becoming eligible for Medicaid on family-level health insurance coverage and spending. The results indicate that an additional family member becoming eligible for Medicaid increases the number of people in the family with Medicaid coverage by about 0.135-0.142 and decreases the likelihood that a family has any medical spending in a quarter by 2.7 percentage points. As previous research often finds with different data sets, I find evidence that Medicaid expansions crowd out some private coverage. Unlike most other data sets, the Consumer Expenditure Survey allows for considering the financial implications of crowd-out. The results indicate that families that transition from private coverage to Medicaid are able to spend significantly less on health insurance expenses, meaning Medicaid expansions can be welfare improving for families even when crowd-out occurs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2017.02.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28242432/,economics

"For the last three decades, both China and India are considered as the largest emerging market economies in the world. Both of these economies play an essential role in the global economy in terms of economic output and CO2 emissions. Hence, these countries are expected to play an important role in setting up environmental and sustainable development policies. Therefore, our paper aims to examine the role of natural gas and renewable energy consumptions on CO2 emissions and economic growth during 1965-2016 within a multivariate framework. The autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach to cointegration and vector error correction model (VECM) is employed to explore the long-run and causal nexus among the natural gas consumption, renewable energy consumption, coal and petroleum consumption, CO2 emissions, and economic growth, respectively. The empirical results show existence of long-run equilibrium association among the variables. The Granger causality results indicate that the short-run bidirectional causality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth in India, while no causality is found between these two variables in China. However, natural gas consumption causes economic growth in China whereas no causality is confirmed in India in the short-run. The findings further suggest that there is long-run bidirectional causality among the considered variables in both countries.

"Background:
        
      
      In the last 10 years, trauma/critical care has become less attractive because of the decreasing surgical caseload, the nocturnal work hours, and the economics of the practice. Nevertheless, during the same period, the number of verified trauma centers has significantly increased. This study assesses the economic drive behind this dichotomy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Over a 1-year period, we collected financial data on 1,907 trauma patients for both Level I trauma centers and trauma/critical care surgeons. Financial data, including payor source, cost, reimbursement, margin, and reimbursement-to-charge and reimbursement-to-direct cost ratios, were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For commercial- and government-insured patients, the reimbursement-to-direct cost ratio was 2-and 35-fold greater, respectively, for the trauma centers than for the trauma/critical care surgeons. For uninsured patients, the addition of local government funds allowed the trauma center to cover direct cost with no margin. In contrast, even with the addition of supplemental salary dollars from the institution, for every dollar in direct cost generated by the trauma/critical care surgeons in caring for uninsured patients, they recovered 55 cents, or a loss of 45 cents per direct cost dollar spent.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The economic dichotomy that exists between trauma centers and trauma/critical surgeons is significant. It drives institutional growth and, at the same time, discourages surgeons from entering the subspecialty. As physician reimbursement decreases and the number of uninsured patients increases, this economic dichotomy will amplify. Over the next decade, without a significant adjustment, the subspecialty is in danger of extinction.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ta.0000171454.91359.d8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16096532/,economics

          Methods:
        
      
      Original investigations from the medical (non-radiological) literature that include economic analyses of radiological interventions were identified from a computerized literature search. Each economic analysis article was evaluated by two independent reviewers for adherence to ten methodological criteria. The criteria were derived from review of the medical and radiological economic analysis methodology literature and consisted of the following: (1) Comparative options stated; (2) perspective of analysis defined; (3) outcome measure identified; (4) cost data included; (5) source of cost data stated; (6) long term costs included; (7) discounting employed; (8) summary measure provided; (9) incremental computation method used; and (10) sensitivity analysis performed. The results were compared to a previous study that evaluated the radiological literature.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 56 articles in the medical literature that included economic analyses of radiological procedures, only eight (14%) conformed to all ten methodological criteria. The cost data (98%) and comparative options (89%) criteria exhibited high compliance, while the perspective of analysis (25%) and discounting (32%) criteria had relatively low compliance. Agreement between the reviewers was excellent (kappa = 0.88).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Published economic analyses of radiology procedures usually do not meet accepted methodological standards.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0720-048x(97)00161-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9639137/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Hypertension in low- and middle-income countries, including Kenya, is of economic importance due to its increasing prevalence and its potential to present an economic burden to households. In this study, we examined the patient costs associated with obtaining care for hypertension in public health care facilities in Kenya.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a cross-sectional study among adult respondents above 18 years of age, with at least 6 months of treatment in two counties. A total of 212 patients seeking hypertension care at five public facilities were interviewed, and information on care seeking and the associated costs was obtained. We computed both annual direct and indirect costs borne by these patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, the mean annual direct cost to patients was US$ 304.8 (95% CI, 235.7-374.0). Medicines (mean annual cost, US$ 168.9; 95% CI, 132.5-205.4), transport (mean annual cost, US$ 126.7; 95% CI, 77.6-175.9), and user charges (mean annual cost, US$ 57.7; 95% CI, 43.7-71.6) were the highest direct cost categories. Overall mean annual indirect cost was US$ 171.7 (95% CI, 152.8-190.5). The incidence of catastrophic health care costs was 43.3% (95% CI, 36.8-50.2) and increased to 59.0% (95% CI, 52.2-65.4) when transport costs were included.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Hypertensive patients incur substantial direct and indirect costs. High rates of catastrophic costs illustrate the urgency of improving financial risk protection for these patients and strengthening primary care to ensure affordability of hypertension care.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2752,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30762904/,economics
"Health care decisions are complex and involve confronting trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting objectives. Using structured, explicit approaches to decisions involving multiple criteria can improve the quality of decision making. A set of techniques, known under the collective heading, multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), are useful for this purpose. In 2014, ISPOR established an Emerging Good Practices Task Force. The task force's first report defined MCDA, provided examples of its use in health care, described the key steps, and provided an overview of the principal methods of MCDA. This second task force report provides emerging good-practice guidance on the implementation of MCDA to support health care decisions. The report includes: a checklist to support the design, implementation and review of an MCDA; guidance to support the implementation of the checklist; the order in which the steps should be implemented; illustrates how to incorporate budget constraints into an MCDA; provides an overview of the skills and resources, including available software, required to implement MCDA; and future research directions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2015.12.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27021745/,economics
"The objective of this article is to assess the total economic costs of road traffic crashes in Barcelona, a metropolitan city located in Southern Europe. A cost-of-illness study was conducted using a prevalence approximation, a societal and healthcare system perspective, and a 1-year time horizon. Results were measured in terms of Euros in 2003. Total costs of road traffic crashes in Barcelona in 2003 were euro367 million. Direct costs equalled euro329 million (89.8% of total costs), including property damage costs, insurance administration costs and hospital costs. Police, emergency costs and transportation costs had a minimum effect on total direct costs. Indirect costs were euro37 million, including lost productivity due to hospitalization and mortality. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed the upper limit of total economic cost of road traffic crashes in Barcelona to be euro782 million. This is the first study to estimate the costs of road traffic crashes for a city in a developed country. The importance of the problem calls for further interventions to reduce road traffic crashes.",https://doi.org/10.1136/ip.2006.012732,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17296693/,economics

"America's health care economy is a paradox of excess and deprivation. We spend more than 11 percent of the gross national product on health care, yet roughly 35 million Americans have no financial protection from medical expenses. To an increasing degree, the present financing system is inflationary, unfair, and wasteful. In its place we need a strategy that addresses the whole system, offers financial protection from health care expenses to all, and promotes the development of economical financing and delivery arrangements. Such a strategy must be designed to be broadly acceptable in our society. To remedy the deprivation, we propose that everyone not covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or some other public program be enabled to buy affordable coverage, either through their employers or through a ""public sponsor."" To attack the excess, we propose a strategy of managed competition in which collective agents, called sponsors, such as the Health Care Financing Administration and large employers, contract with competing health plans and manage a process of informed cost-conscious consumer choice that rewards providers who deliver high-quality care economically.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198901053200106,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2642604/,economics
"Choices need to be made between competing uses of health care resources. There is debate about how these choices should be made, who should make them and the criteria upon which they should be made. Evaluation of health care is an important part of this debate. It has been suggested that the contribution of health economics to the evaluation of health promotion is limited, both because the methods and principles underlying economic evaluation are unsuited to health promotion, and because the political and cultural processes governing the health care system are more appropriate mechanisms for allocating health care resources than systematic economic analysis of the costs and benefits of different health care choices. This view misrepresents and misunderstands the contribution of health economics to the evaluation of health promotion. It overstates the undoubted methodological difficulties of evaluating health promotion. It also argues, mistakenly, that economists see economic evaluation as a substitute for the political and cultural processes governing health care, rather than an input to them. This paper argues for an economics input on grounds of efficiency, accountability and ethics, and challenges the critics of the economic approach to judge alternative mechanisms for allocating resources by the same criteria.",https://doi.org/10.1093/her/11.3.355,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10163566/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Investments in continuing medical education (CME) exceed $2 billion annually, but few studies report the economic impact of CME activities. Analysis of patient-level economic outcomes data is often not feasible. Accordingly, we developed a model to illustrate estimation of the potential economic impact associated with CME activity outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Outcomes impact analysis demonstrated how costs averted from a CME symposium that promoted prevention of bleeding-related complications (BRC) and reoperation for bleeding (RFB) in cardiac and thoracic operations could be estimated. Model parameter estimates were from published studies of costs associated with BRC and RFB. Operative volume estimates came from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons workforce data. The base case predicted 3 in 10 participants preventing one BRC or RFB in 2% or 1.5% of annual operations, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) evaluated the effect of parameter uncertainty.
    


          Results:
        
      
      92% of participants (n = 133) self-reported commitment to change, a validated measure of behavior change. For BRC, estimates for costs averted were $1,502,769 (95% confidence interval [CI], $869,860-$2,359,068) for cardiac operations and $2,715,246 (95% CI, $1,590,308-$4,217,092) for thoracic operations. For RFB, the savings estimates were $2,233,988 (95% CI, $1,223,901-$3,648,719).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our economic model demonstrates that application of CME-related learning to prevent bleeding complications may yield substantial cost savings. Model prediction of averted costs associated with CME allows estimation of the economic impact on outcomes in the absence of patient-level outcomes data related to CME activities.",https://doi.org/10.1002/chp.21236,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24935883/,economics
"Public and private health insurance plans face the question of whether to cover emerging genetic tests for cancer and other diseases. This paper outlines issues in the economic evaluation of new genetic tests, illustrating key methodological issues and policy implications with findings from a comprehensive and systematic review of the 14 full economic evaluations published over the past 5 years that have addressed both the costs and consequences of molecular genetic tests. Key questions for framing an evaluation include: whose viewpoint matters, which costs and consequences are relevant, and to which clinical alternatives should new genetic tests be compared? While economic evaluation research can inform coverage decisions about genetic tests, the coverage decision-making process must also inform economic researchers about the aims, context, and value systems within which genetic tests will be covered and practised.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000072998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14560066/,economics
"In developing countries, where health insurance is not a commonly purchased financial instrument, recent debates have revolved around extending health insurance coverage to a wider range of the population, primarily via compulsory insurance schemes. However, these debates rarely consider the competing demands placed on the family budget, which will influence the acceptability of the program by the populace. In this paper, we draw on data from the 2000 income and expenditure survey to examine treatment effects associated with household insurance status, providing a detailed examination of expenditure substitution patterns within South Africa. In agreement with economic theory, the expansion of health insurance coverage via compulsory schemes creates additional burdens for households, which households accommodate via expenditure substitution. The observed variation in the household's ability to accommodate increased expenditure can and should be used in future to assess policy options and in the design of an optimal social health insurance program.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.10.015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19879025/,economics
"Administrative claims data are big data generated from healthcare encounters. Claims data contain information on insurance payment as well as clinical diagnoses and procedure codes to ascertain medical conditions and treatments, making them valuable sources for economic evaluation research. This paper offers an introductory overview of the use of claims data for oncology-related cost-of-illness, cost comparison, and cost-effectiveness analyses. We reviewed analytical methods commonly employed in these analyses, such as the phase of care approach and net costing method for cost-of-illness studies, propensity score matching methods for cost comparison studies, and net benefit regression models for cost-effectiveness studies. We used published studies to explain each method and to discuss methodological challenges of conducting economic studies using claims data.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semradonc.2019.05.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31472737/,economics

"This article investigates the economic theory and interpretation of the concept of ""value-based pricing"" for new breakthrough drugs with no close substitutes in a context (such as the United States) in which a drug firm with market power sells its product to various buyers. The interpretation is different from that in a country that evaluates medicines for a single public health insurance plan or a set of heavily regulated plans. It is shown that there will not ordinarily be a single value-based price but rather a schedule of prices with different volumes of buyers at each price. Hence, it is incorrect to term a particular price the value-based price, or to argue that the profit-maximizing monopoly price is too high relative to some hypothesized value-based price. When effectiveness of treatment or value of health is heterogeneous, the profit-maximizing price can be higher than that associated with assumed values of quality-adjusted life-years. If the firm sets a price higher than the value-based price for a set of potential buyers, the optimal strategy of the buyers is to decline to purchase that drug. The profit-maximizing price will come closer to a unique value-based price if demand is less heterogeneous.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.11.017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28237209/,economics

The MOH reprioritised the development of health projects. Important projects such as rural health projects and training facilities, and committed projects, were continued. In public health, population-based preventive and promotive activities were expected to experience some form of curtailment.

"Background:
        
      
      Some experts have proposed combating rising drug prices by promoting brand-brand competition, a situation that is supposed to arise when multiple US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved brand-name products in the same class are indicated for the same condition. However, numerous reports exist of price increases following the introduction of brand-name competition, suggesting that it may not be effective. We performed a systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed health policy and economics literature to better understand the interplay between new drug entry and intraclass drug prices.
    


          Methods and findings:
        
      
      We searched PubMed and EconLit for original studies on brand-brand competition in the US market published in English between January 1990 and April 2019. We performed a qualitative synthesis of each study's data, recording its primary objective, methodology, and results. We found 10 empirical investigations, with 1 study each on antihypertensives, anti-infectives, central nervous system stimulants for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis, histamine-2 (H2) blockers, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors; 2 studies on cancer medications; and 2 studies on all marketed or new drugs. None of the studies reported that brand-brand competition lowers list prices of existing drugs within a class. The findings of 2 studies suggest that such competition may help restrain how new drug prices are set. Other studies found evidence that brand-brand competition was mediated by the relative quality of competing drugs and the extent to which they are marketed, with safer or more effective new drugs and greater marketing associated with higher intraclass list prices. Our investigation was limited by the studies' use of list rather than net prices and the age of some of the data.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our findings suggest that policies to promote brand-brand competition in the US pharmaceutical market, such as accelerating approval of non-first-in-class drugs, will likely not result in lower drug list prices absent additional structural reforms.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31361747/,economics
"Cost and other resources required are often primary considerations in whether a potential program or policy will be adopted or implemented and an important element in determining value. However, few economic analyses are conducted from the perspective of patient/family or small-scale stakeholders such as local clinics. We outline and discuss alternative cost assessment and resource expenditures options from the perspective of these small, proximal stakeholders. The perspective of these persons differs from larger societal or health plan perspectives, and often differs across individuals in terms of what they value and the types of expenditures about which they are concerned. We discuss key features of the perspectives of patients, health care clinics, and local leaders, and present brief examples and sample templates for collection of consumer/stakeholder relevant cost and return on investment issues. These tools can be used prospectively and iteratively during program planning, intervention delivery, summative analysis, and preparation for dissemination stages. There is an important need for this type of feasible, pragmatic, rapid, and iterative cost and resource expenditure analysis directly relevant to patients/families, small local stakeholders and their organizations.

"In Germany the economical framework of the health system in general and the hospitals in particular has changed dramatically over the last years. The conversion of funding to DRGs has implicated a reduction of budgets. The apportioning of budgets by keys of officially calculating hospitals forces single departments and disciplines to choose financial goals of a hospital as their particular interest and not the financial goals of a department. The calculation of a budget for a department of anaesthesia and/or intensive care medicine is possible from fractions of all DRGs, that have been generated inside a hospital within a period of one year. However, this calculation comprises some problems, because anaesthesia and intensive care medicine are interdisciplinary disciplines, which cannot influence its achievements and its processes solely by its own, but are dependent on efficiency and quality of its partners. Internal cost allocation for improving processes seems not to be sensible in the system of DRGs as long as it is used not only as an instrument of controlling, but also as an instrument of benchmarking.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-1003597,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18040939/,economics
"In March 2010 Congress established an abbreviated Food and Drug Administration approval pathway for biosimilars-drugs that are very similar but not identical to a reference biological product and cost less. Because bringing biosimilars to the market currently requires large investments of money, fewer biosimilars are expected to enter the biologics market than has been the case with generic drugs entering the small-molecule drug market. Additionally, given the high regulatory hurdles to obtaining interchangeability-which would allow pharmacists to substitute a biosimilar for its reference product, subject to evolving state substitution laws-most biosimilars will likely compete as therapeutic alternatives instead of as therapeutic equivalents. In other words, biosimilars will need to compete with their reference product on the basis of quality; price; and manufacturer's reputation with physicians, insurers, and patient groups. Biosimilars also will face dynamic competition from new biologics in the same therapeutic class-including ""biobetters,"" which offer incremental improvements on reference products, such as extended duration of action. The prospects for significant cost savings from the use of biosimilars appear to be limited for the next several years, but their use should increase over time because of both demand- and supply-side factors.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0862,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24889955/,economics

"This article provides an overview of selected economic aspects of primary prevention, from an international perspective. It starts by qualifying two widely held myths about the economics of prevention. It then discusses two core components of the economic argument for (or against) prevention: first, this involves providing a very basic, efficiency-based rationale for a role of government in prevention; second, we review the existing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of primary prevention. While a fair amount of encouraging evidence exists, there has definitely been far more cost-effectiveness research on clinical than on non-clinical primary prevention (e. g., health promotion). The article seeks to explain this comparative shortage, which carries over to pure effectiveness research on prevention. It concludes by arguing the economic case for a role of government not only in prevention but also, and even more so, in research on non-clinical prevention.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0029-1239569,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19885761/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Resource allocation decisions for disease categories can be informed by proper estimates of the magnitude and distribution of total spending. In the backdrop of a high burden of Non-Communicable Diseases and Injuries (NCDI) in India, and a paucity of estimates on government spending on NCDI, this paper attempts to analyse public sector expenditure on NCDI spending in India.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Various recent budget documents of the Centre and States/Union Territories have been used to extract expenditure on NCDI. The aggregates thus arrived at have been analysed to estimate aggregate and state level per capita spending. State level spending have been compared against disease burden using DALYs. Patterns of spending on NCDI across states were also analysed together with state level poverty to observe possible patterns.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The total spending on NCDI by the government is low at less than 0.5% of GDP. NCDI spending is little more than one-fourth of total health spending of the country and most spending takes place at the state level (80%). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's share in Central spending on NCDI is around 65%, and currently it spends 20% of its total health spending on NCDI. The gap between spending and DALYs is the most for the economically vulnerable states. Also, the states with high poverty levels also have low per capita expenditure on NCDI.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      India does not depend on donor funding for health. It will have to step up domestic funding to address the increasing disease burden of NCDIs and to reduce the high out-of-pocket expenditure on NCDI. Policies on NCDI need to focus on UHC, service integration and personnel gaps.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513623/,economics
"We studied the extent to which hospitals can expect to receive reimbursement for costs relating to nosocomial infections (NI) under the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) system of clinical claims and calculated the loss of reimbursement due to missed or incorrect registration of infective complications on hospital discharge records (HDR). We calculated clinical claim reimbursement in three scenarios: the good, in which all NI are recorded on HDR; the bad, in which a proportion of NI recorded on HDR observed at the 41 participating hospitals; the ugly, in which none of the NI are recorded on HDR. We analysed in which patients the recording of infective complications changed the DRG clinical claim and the economic consequences on reimbursements. Compared with the ugly scenario, the bad scenario, which is closest to what actually occurs, with only 55.9% of NI (180/322) properly recorded, produced an increased DRG clinical claim in 30 cases, of on average 403 for every NI. Compared with the ugly scenario, the good scenario, produced an increased DRG clinical claim in 45 cases with an average reimbursement of 618. The difference between the bad and the good scenarios shows an average loss of 215 for every case. Our calculated good scenario could cover only 3.8% of direct costs per case attributable to NI. Real, tangible benefits in health, both social and economic, will only accrue from the monitoring and control of NI in hospitals.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2003.10.014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15019228/,economics
"The interest in economic evaluation of alternative strategies for haemophilia treatment has increased through the years. Few studies have actually been undertaken, however, and most of them have been simple cost-minimization or cost-effectiveness analyses. From the perspective of the binational project 'Treatment strategies for severe haemophilia-prophylaxis vs. on-demand', the present paper discusses the pros and cons of different methods for economic evaluation and their data requirements. Severe haemophilia is a rare disease that requires lifelong treatment. In addition, treatment has both short- and long-term effects which are likely to differ between strategies. Accordingly, regardless of the chosen evaluation method, data requirements are non-trivial. Hence, the various problems connected to the generation of data, as well as how they may be addressed, are also discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1355-0691.2004.00878.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14987248/,economics
"This paper traces the evolution of economists' views about risk segmentation in health insurance markets. Originally seen as a desirable goal, risk segmentation has come to be viewed as leading to abnormal profits, wasted resources, and inefficient limitations on coverage and services. We suggest that risk segmentation may be efficient if one takes an ex post view (i.e., after consumers' risks are known). From this perspective, managed care may be a much better method for achieving risk segmentation than limitations on coverage. The most serious objection to risk segmentation is the ex ante concern that it undermines long-term insurance contracts that would protect consumers against changes in lifetime risk.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(00)00051-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11010237/,economics

"This paper investigates the change in price elasticity of health insurance choice in Germany after a reform of health insurance contributions. Using a comprehensive data set of all sickness funds between 2004 and 2013, price elasticities are calculated both before and after the reform for the entire market. The general price elasticity is found to be increased more than 4-fold from -0.81 prior to the reform to -3.53 after the reform. By introducing a new kind of health insurance contribution the reform seemingly increased the price elasticity of insured individuals to a more appropriate level under the given market parameters. However, further unintended consequences of the new contribution scheme were massive losses of market share for the more expensive sickness funds and therefore an undivided focus on pricing as the primary competitive element to the detriment of quality.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2015.01.014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25670009/,economics
"Competition has become a popular prescription for the problem of rising health costs. One issue largely absent fom discussions of market systems and medicine, however, has been analysis of the implications for the poor. This paper explores the implications of proposals to use health maintenance organizations and vouchers to promote competition. We conclude that, as they stand, pro-competitive proposals could cause a significant deterioration in the position of the poor, especially if costs continue to rise, and that their effects are likely to be exacerbated by problems with implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-7-2-488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7050236/,economics
"This paper focuses on evaluating the systemic risk in interbank networks, proposing a series of measurements: risk distance, risk degree and m-order risk degree. The proposed measurements are formally proven to have good basic and extended properties that are able to reflect the effect of bank size, liability size, liability distribution, and the discount factor on the default risk, not only of a single bank, but also of the entire system. Additionally, the abovementioned properties and the relationship between risk distance and financial contagion indicate the rationality embodied in the proposed measurements. This paper also provides some implications on how to decrease or prevent the systemic risk in an interbank system.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30001356/,economics
"The existence of finite healthcare budgets drives the need to consider opportunity cost and demonstrate that pharmacogenomic interventions offer added value, in terms of the relative costs and benefits, compared with current practice. This is where the framework of cost-effectiveness analysis is useful. Existing systematic reviews of economic evaluations of genetic technologies have all highlighted the need to improve the quality of the economics evidence base. More recent cost-effectiveness analyses of pharmacogenomics are generally of higher quality. The future will see an increase in the number of published cost-effectiveness analyses. Critical appraisal of these analyses is necessary to ensure the evidence base is sufficiently robust to inform resource allocation decisions at local and national levels.",https://doi.org/10.2217/pgs.10.45,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20415553/,economics
"We model competition between two firms selling identical goods to customers who arrive in the market stochastically. Shoppers choose where to purchase based upon both price and the time cost associated with waiting for service. One seller provides two separate queues, each with its own server, while the other seller has a single queue and server. We explore the market impact of the multi-server seller engaging in waiting cost-based-price discrimination by charging a premium for express checkout. Specifically, we analyze this situation computationally and through the use of controlled laboratory experiments. We find that this form of price discrimination is harmful to sellers and beneficial to consumers. When the two-queue seller offers express checkout for impatient customers, the single queue seller focuses on the patient shoppers thereby driving down prices and profits while increasing consumer surplus.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092070,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24667809/,economics
"There is no doubt that obesity is a major public health problem. However, what is the contribution of economics to solving it? In this report, we make the case that the role of economics is not in measuring the economic burden of obesity, through so-called cost-of-illness studies. Such studies merely confirm that obesity is a serious societal issue; adding a monetary figure to this does not add much. The economic foundations of such estimates can also be questioned, thus lessening their policy relevance. The real value of economics in the arena of obesity care is in evaluating, through formal economic evaluation, the use of our scarce health care resources in different strategies to prevent and treat obesity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2004.23,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14981208/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Administrative costs are an important spending category in total health insurance expenditure. Yet, they have rarely been a topic outside the US and there is no cross-country comparison available. This paper provides a global overview and analysis of administrative costs for social security schemes (SSS) and private health insurance schemes (PHI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The analysis is based on data of the World Health Organization (WHO) National Health Accounts (NHA) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) System of Health Accounts (SHA). These are the only worldwide databases on health expenditure data. Further data was retrieved from a literature search. Administrative costs are presented as a share of total health insurance costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data is available for 58 countries. In high-income OECD countries, the average SSS administrative costs are 4.2%. Average PHI administrative costs are about three times higher. The shares are much higher for low- and middle-income countries. However, considerable variations across and within countries over time are revealed.
    


          Discussion and conclusion:
        
      
      Seven explanatory factors are explored to explain the variations: health financing system aspects, administrative activities undertaken, insurance design aspects, context factors, reporting format, accounting methods, and management and administrative efficiency measures. More detailed reporting of administrative costs would enhance comparability and provide benchmarks. Improved administrative efficiency could free resources to expand coverage.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.07.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880390/,economics
"The use of cost-effectiveness modeling to prioritize healthcare spending has become a key foundation of UK government policy. Although the preferred method of evaluation-cost-utility analysis-is not without its critics, it represents a standard approach that can arguably be used to assess relative value for money across a range of disease types and interventions. A key limitation of economic modeling, however, is that its conclusions hinge on the input assumptions, many of which are derived from randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses that cannot be reliably linked to real-world performance of treatments in a broader clinical context. This means that spending decisions are frequently based on artificial constructs that may project costs and benefits that are significantly at odds with those that are achievable in reality. There is a clear agenda to carry out some form of predictive validation for the model claims, in order to assess not only whether the spending decisions made can be justified post hoc, but also to ensure that budgetary expenditure continues to be allocated in the most rational way. To date, however, no timely, effective system to carry out this testing has been implemented, with the consequence that there is little objective evidence as to whether the prioritization decisions made are actually living up to expectations. This article reviews two unfulfilled initiatives that have been carried out in the UK over the past 20 years, each of which had the potential to address this objective, and considers why they failed to deliver the expected outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.3111/13696998.2015.1108918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26548424/,economics
"The introduction of laparoscopic surgery was believed to bestow great advantages to patients and health services. Health services and societal costs may also be affected by changes in length of hospital stay, operating room costs and return to normal activity. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of two different reimbursement methods (per diem and DRG) on the incentives and disincentives given to different role players in the Israeli health-care system regarding two common surgical procedures: appendectomy and inguinal hernia repair. Three different perspectives are discussed: society, the hospitals and the sick funds. From the hospital's perspective, laparoscopic surgery is usually more expensive compared to open procedures, mainly due to higher operating room costs. We suggest that as far as current reimbursement methods are preserved, hospitals have no economic incentive to adopt the laparoscopic technology as benefits occur only to society. In general, sick funds would encourage hospitals to perform laparoscopic appendectomy, where the payment is per diem and would be economically indifferent regarding laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, where hospitals are compensated on a DRG basis. It has been suggested that economic advantages to society may arise from a faster return to work after laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. In this case, new payment arrangements should be set to give proper incentives for the adoption of laparoscopic procedures.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(00)00131-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11230908/,economics
"The economic burden of depression includes direct costs of treatment, as well as absenteeism and reduced productivity. In this study, we consider the costs and benefits of an intervention to assess and treat depressive symptoms in long-term disability claimants with nonpsychiatric medical illnesses. Cost-benefit simulations were conducted using data from a study sample of long-term disability claimants (N = 1229) and estimates of both the costs of treatment of depressive symptoms and the savings in claims payments for those who return to work as a result of treatment. We show that the savings that stem from returning a very few claimants to work can offset the assumed cost of a comprehensive program for the assessment of depressive symptoms in all claimants and intensive treatment of those with depressive symptoms. The economic and public health benefits both point toward the value of such an intervention for disability claimants.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005053-200201000-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11838028/,economics
"In most economic evaluations, future monetary costs and benefits and future health benefits are discounted at the same rate. The purpose of this article is to question such current practice. The primary reason behind discounting costs and benefits is to allow for individuals' preferences over the timing of such events, i.e. to represent social time preference. We argue that the social time preference rate for health benefits is unlikely to be the same as that for monetary costs and benefits. The results of a sensitivity analysis of pharmacoeconomic analyses of drug treatments for hypertension illustrate how the choice of discount rate can affect the conclusions. As no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding the magnitude of the discount rate for health benefits, we recommend that analysts conduct sensitivity analyses employing differential discount rates for health benefits as well as monetary costs and benefits.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199202020-00007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10146954/,economics
"The aging population and the increasing availability of new medical technologies, particularly pharmaceuticals, have led to growing pressure on governments worldwide to contain healthcare costs. Increasingly, economic evaluation is used to aid decisions on the reimbursement and formulary access of drugs, and pharmaceutical companies are often required to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of their products. Canada and the UK are examples of countries that have successfully incorporated mandatory requirements for economic evaluations into the decision-making process in healthcare. Japan faces cost-containment issues for its health and welfare system similar to those seen elsewhere in the world. Despite this, economic assessments are not currently used in the allocation of drug budgets. Reasons why economic evaluations for healthcare have not yet been used routinely in Japan include governmental approaches to healthcare cost containment, the pricing of pharmaceuticals, the organisation of the healthcare system, attitudes of the medical profession, and limited knowledge and expertise. However, small but encouraging steps are now being taken towards the introduction of economic evaluations in Japanese medicine.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200220002-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12238943/,economics

"Health economic evaluations (i.e. cost-effectiveness appraisal of an intervention) are useful aids for decision makers responsible for the allocation of scarce healthcare resources. The relevance of including health-related productivity costs (or benefits) in these evaluations is increasingly recognized and, as such, reliable and valid instruments to quantify productivity costs are needed. Over the years, a number of work productivity instruments have emerged in the literature, along with a growing body of psychometric evidence. The overall aim of this paper is to provide a review of available instruments with potential for estimating health-related productivity costs. This included the Health and Labor Questionnaire, Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, Health-Related Productivity Questionnaire Diary, Productivity and Disease Questionnaire, Quantity and Quality method, Stanford Presenteeism Scale 13, Valuation of Lost Productivity, Work and Health Interview, Work Limitations Questionnaire, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire, and Work Productivity Short Inventory.

"Objectives:
        
      
      The paper analyzes the German inpatient capital costing scheme by assessing its cost module calculation. The costing scheme represents the first separated national calculation of performance-oriented capital cost lump sums per DRG.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The three steps in the costing scheme are reviewed and assessed: (1) accrual of capital costs; (2) cost-center and cost category accounting; (3) data processing for capital cost modules. The assessment of each step is based on its level of transparency and efficiency. A comparative view on operating costing and the English costing scheme is given.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Advantages of the scheme are low participation hurdles, low calculation effort for G-DRG calculation participants, highly differentiated cost-center/cost category separation, and advanced patient-based resource allocation. The exclusion of relevant capital costs, nontransparent resource allocation, and unclear capital cost modules, limit the managerial relevance and transparency of the capital costing scheme.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The scheme generates the technical premises for a change from dual financing by insurances (operating costs) and state (capital costs) to a single financing source. The new capital costing scheme will intensify the discussion on how to solve the current investment backlog in Germany and can assist regulators in other countries with the introduction of accurate capital costing.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2014.01.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24508182/,economics
"In this paper, we build and analyze a general equilibrium model to evaluate the effects of environment tax reform on a small open economy in a ""suboptimal environment"" with existing tax distortions. We then use the macroeconomic data from the Chongqing Municipality in China to conduct simulations to empirically test our analytic results. Our main findings include the followings. First, an increase in environmental tax rate can effectively reduce the use of polluting consumer goods by households as well as investment in polluting factors by enterprises. Hence, an increase in environmental tax rate can improve environmental quality and obtain ""environmental dividend"". Second, an increase in environmental tax rate can negatively impact employment, family income and economic growth. Hence, there is no ""non-environmental dividend"" effect. Third, an increased environmental tax rate has both substitution effect and income effect on household consumption. On the one hand, it motivates households to substitute polluting consumer goods with clean consumer goods. On the other hand, it lowers the total consumption level of households. Fourth, we show that the ""double dividend"" hypothesis on environmental tax is invalid. And the optimal environmental tax under the suboptimal environment is lower than the Pigouvian tax rate.

"Burn injury is one of the most devastating injuries that may affect a patient. Even in economically deprived areas, burn care is largely driven by relatively plentiful resources equating quality of care with generous monitoring and clinical attention with little concern to management cost. Burn care costs have been the subject of very few investigations and are among the least studied by health services researchers. Nevertheless, it can be stated that local care of burn wounds accounts for a large proportion of the cost per day for treating patients. As economic times are changing and as market penetration of managed care contracts and stiff competition in the health care industry gains momentum, ways to reduce expenditures without adversely affecting the quality of care have become of primary importance.

"Pressed by an impressive series of corruption scandals and by a change of attitude towards cost-containment, the Italian pharmaceutical sector's regulatory environment was radically changed in 1994. Regulatory power was concentrated on a national technical body (CUF) and a new set of measures was taken, including a nationwide drug expenditure budget, a redefinition of both the positive list and the cost-sharing rules, and new price-setting models. As a result, in the period 1993-1996, nominal expenditures decreased by about L 1600 billion (ECU 83.6 billion at 1997 exchange rate), that is from 13.3% to 11.0% of current National Health Service (NHS) expenditure. While in the 1980s Italy was one of the most generous countries in funding pharmaceuticals, it is now one of the most parsimonious. Although the overall pharmaceutical market shrank in 1994 and 1995, a substantial part of NHS drug-bill savings resulted from cost-shifting from the public sector to patients, mainly because physicians have not aligned their prescribing behaviour to the new positive list. The new Italian approach to containing pharmaceutical costs has been certainly effective, at least in the short run. However, new relevant issues are emerging regarding the fall of NHS pharmaceutical coverage, the centralised nature of the Italian pharmaceutical policy and the gap between scientific based policies and actual prescribing behaviours.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(98)00047-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10187653/,economics
"We study catastrophic behaviors in large networked systems in the paradigm of evolutionary games by incorporating a realistic ""death"" or ""bankruptcy"" mechanism. We find that a cascading bankruptcy process can arise when defection strategies exist and individuals are vulnerable to deficit. Strikingly, we observe that, after the catastrophic cascading process terminates, cooperators are the sole survivors, regardless of the game types and of the connection patterns among individuals as determined by the topology of the underlying network. It is necessary that individuals cooperate with each other to survive the catastrophic failures. Cooperation thus becomes the optimal strategy and absolutely outperforms defection in the game evolution with respect to the ""death"" mechanism. Our results can be useful for understanding large-scale catastrophe in real-world systems and in particular, they may yield insights into significant social and economical phenomena such as large-scale failures of financial institutions and corporations during an economic recession.",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3621719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21974647/,economics

We used new and unique data on privately insured people to estimate the effect of the economic slowdown that began in December 2007 on the rate of growth in health spending. By exploiting regional variations in the severity of the slowdown, we determined that the economic slowdown explained approximately 70 percent of the slowdown in health spending growth for the people in our sample.

These entities differ in their missions, scope of activities, and methodological approaches. Because they are gaining visibility and some traction in the United States, it is essential to scrutinize whether the frameworks use approaches that are transparent as well as conceptually and methodologically sound.

"Infrastructure is a basic physical structure that is essential for the facilitation of society in terms of the provision of the basic framework that is required for the economy's output. The transport infrastructure is one of the most promising tools for generating economic growth and development because of its constructive impact on multidimensional aspects of society. The carbon emissions emanating from different sectors are used to capture the environmental quality in Pakistan and its association with road infrastructure of the country. Transportation is the main source of carbon emissions (GHGs), and road transport is the biggest emitter that accounted for more than 70% of emissions from GHGs in 2014 in Pakistan. We have used fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) approaches to analyze the role of carbon emissions (aggregate and disaggregate forms) along with road infrastructure on economic growth for the period of 1972-2017. Moreover, before the main analysis, the co-integrating relationships are also analyzed in this study. Our findings pronounce that there is a positive observable relationship between road infrastructure and economic growth. However, the impact of carbon emissions (irrespective of aggregate or disaggregate forms) is negative on economic growth. The findings suggest that the improvements in economic growth can be achieved through road infrastructure structure development but at cost of deterioration of environmental quality (increase in carbon emissions). Although emissions diminish economic growth over time but on the other side, the economic incorporation increases through the investment in road infrastructure which is of assistance for the construction and manufacturing industry.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12936-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33687632/,economics
"The health care system can be characterized, among other facts, by the multiplicity of involved actors (institutions and individuals) acting for final goals in competition, or even in opposition. The principal goal of the economic organization of the health care system consists in applying a regulation to grant the coordination of the great number of decisions taken by decentralized actors in order to introduce them in economic way into a common final goal. The market forces appear unable to realize the necessary regulation in the health care system and centralized planning can lead to lack of effectiveness. For this reason, it's necessary to make use of a decentralized economic regulation; in this view health care financing systems are essential and could positively influence the behaviour of the actors as well as the costs.

"The ideology and process of victim blaming have undergone profound changes as a consequence of recent sociopolitical developments. This paper examines a newer and more pernicious form of victim blaming, with particular attention to the ways it has been directed at the elderly in American society. Several contexts are presented within which we may view recent budget cuts affecting the elderly in order to analyze the scapegoating of the aged as a primary ""cause"" of the fiscal crisis. These contexts include the cyclical nature of social problems, which expand or contract in accordance with the dominant needs of the economy; the ""fiscal crisis mentality""; the philosophy and tactics of decentralization; and the Reagan Administration's move toward an ""ideological definition of reality."" Each of these contexts is seen as fitting within the overarching context of the current economic crisis and the intensified class conflict and related outcomes which it has generated. Unlike the victim blaming of the 1960s and early 70s, which defined ""the elderly"" as a social problem and devised solutions (e.g. expanded Social Security benefits, Medicare and Medicaid) for dealing with that problem, the victim blaming of the 1980s is seen as defining these earlier ""solutions"" as part of the problem. Not only are the aged problematic, but ameliorative programs are seen as ""busting the federal budget"" and in need of dismantling and/or shifting to other levels of government and the private sector. Education grounded in political-economic analyses of the ""aging problem,"" aimed in part at overcoming structurally induced divisiveness among oppressed groups, is suggested as an important deterrent to the increased polarization which the current fiscal crisis mentality has nurtured.",https://doi.org/10.2190/gf9x-xh3r-flxd-d9gh,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6832872/,economics
"Vaccines save thousands of lives in the United States every year, but many adults remain unvaccinated. Low rates of vaccine uptake lead to costs to individuals and society in terms of deaths and disabilities, which are avoidable, and they create economic losses from doctor visits, hospitalizations, and lost income. To identify the magnitude of this problem, we calculated the current economic burden that is attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases among US adults. We estimated the total remaining economic burden at approximately $9 billion (plausibility range: $4.7-$15.2 billion) in a single year, 2015, from vaccine-preventable diseases related to ten vaccines recommended for adults ages nineteen and older. Unvaccinated individuals are responsible for almost 80 percent, or $7.1 billion, of the financial burden. These results not only indicate the potential economic benefit of increasing adult immunization uptake but also highlight the value of vaccines. Policies should focus on minimizing the negative externalities or spillover effects from the choice not to be vaccinated, while preserving patient autonomy.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0462,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27733424/,economics

      We advocate the use of a thorough budget impact analysis that includes assessments of the change in costs and revenues for each organization over the short run and the monetary value of the intervention to the participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      By anticipating the types of economic information that will best promote sustainability, behavioral medicine researchers can better ensure the successful dissemination and translation of their interventions into sustained practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-014-9437-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25189291/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Cost-of-illness (COI) studies provide useful information on the economic burden that schizophrenia imposes on a society.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study aims to give a general overview of COI studies for schizophrenia and to compare the societal cost of schizophrenia across countries. It also aims to identify the main cost components of schizophrenia and factors associated with higher societal cost to improve the quality and reporting of COI studies for schizophrenia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed an electronic search on multiple databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Health Management Information Consortium [HMIC] and the System for Information on Grey Literature [openSIGLE]) to identify COI studies of schizophrenia published between 1996 and 2016. The primary outcome of this review was societal cost per schizophrenia patient, by cost component. All costs were converted to $US, year 2015 values.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 19 studies in this review. The annual societal cost per patient varied from $US5818 in Thailand to $US94,587 in Norway; whereas the lifetime societal cost per patient was estimated to be $US988,264 in Australia (all year 2015 values). The main cost drivers were direct healthcare costs and productivity losses. Factors associated with higher individual costs included patient demographics, severity of disease and methods used to calculate the costs of productivity losses and comorbidities.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review highlights the large economic burden of schizophrenia. The magnitude of the cost estimates differs considerably across countries, which might be caused by different economic conditions and healthcare systems and widespread methodological heterogeneity among COI studies. Proposed recommendations based on this review can be used to improve the consistency and comparability of COI studies for schizophrenia.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-016-0444-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27557994/,economics
"An article published in this Journal argued that New Zealand does not apply a cost-effectiveness threshold because medicines are funded within a fixed budget and because cost-effectiveness is only one of nine criteria that inform decisions. This Comment has explained that, from a theoretical perspective, the cost-effectiveness threshold model is not inconsistent with these two arguments. The observed annual variation in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in New Zealand may originate from yearly differences in new medicines that request reimbursement and in the budget size, and from the fact that decision makers take into account other decision criteria in addition to cost-effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph7041835,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20617062/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to measure the direct costs of treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the indirect costs in the workplace. This was accomplished through retrospective analysis of administrative claims data from a national Fortune 100 manufacturer, which includes all medical, pharmaceutical, and disability claims for the company's employees, spouses/dependents, and retirees.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with IBS were identified as individuals, aged 18 to 64 years, who received a primary code for IBS or a secondary code for IBS and a primary code for constipation or abdominal pain between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1998. Of these patients with IBS, 93.7% were matched based on age, sex, employment status, and ZIP code to a control population of beneficiaries. Direct and indirect costs for patients with IBS were compared with those of matched controls.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average total cost (direct plus indirect) per patient with IBS was 4527 dollars in 1998 compared with 3276 dollars for a control beneficiary (P<.001). The average physician visit costs were 524 dollars and 345 dollars for patients with IBS and controls, respectively (P<.001). The average outpatient care costs to the employer were 1258 dollars and 742 dollars for patients with IBS and controls, respectively (P<.001). Medically related work absenteeism cost the employer 901 dollars on average per employee treated for IBS compared with 528 dollars on average per employee without IBS (P<.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Irritable bowel syndrome is a significant financial burden on the employer that arises from an increase in direct and indirect costs compared with the control group.",https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.163.8.929,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12719202/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      In contrast to other countries, the appearance of locum physicians as independent contractors constitutes a rather new phenomenon in the German health care system and emerged out of a growing economization and shortage of medical staff in the hospital sector. Locums are a special type of self-employed professionals who are only temporally embedded in organisational contexts of hospitals, and this might have consequences for their professional practice. Therefore, questions arise regarding how locums perceive their ethical duties as medical professionals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this first qualitative study on German locum physicians, the locums' own perspective is complemented by the viewpoint of permanently employed physician colleagues. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2014 to explore the professional practice of locum physicians from both groups' perspectives with respect to doctor-patient-relationship, cooperation with colleagues and physicians' role in society. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis, including a deductive application and an inductive development of codes. The results were related to key tenets of medical professionalism with respect to the question: how far do locums fulfil their ethical duties towards patients, colleagues and the society?
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study indicates that although ethical requirements are met broadly, difficulties remain with respect to close doctor-patient contact and the sustainability of hiring locums as a remedy in times of staff shortage.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Further qualitative and quantitative research on locum physicians' professional practice, including patient perspectives and economic health care system analyses, is needed to better understand the ethical impact of hiring independent contractors in the hospital sector.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3118-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29739411/,economics
"A lack of access to critical drugs in the USA, either due to exorbitant prices or shortages, has become a troubling norm that threatens the quality and safety of healthcare. In 2017, there were shortages of 146 commonly used drugs including electrolytes, chemotherapy, cardiovascular, and antibiotic agents. For example, there currently exists a shortage in intravenous fluids and injectable opioids (both in chronic short supply for years) that has been respectively ascribed to disruptions in pharmaceutical manufacturing by Hurricane Maria and manufacturing delays. These explanations, however, mask a more fundamental and avoidable cause: a lack of healthy competition in the generic drug market which is likely contributing to price hikes and shortages. By understanding this underlying cause, we hope to illuminate a pathway from our current state of complacency, where drug price hikes and shortages are routine, to a future state of effective action, where patients have reliable access to vital drugs. This article outlines a roadmap to influence incentives, regulations, new drug development, and ultimately stakeholder (i.e., patients, providers, and drug makers) behavior to enhance competition, with the ultimate aim of improving the quality and safety of healthcare for our patients.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-018-4548-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30091120/,economics
"This paper examines the relationship between health expenditure and economic growth using panel data consisting low and high-income countries. Using dynamic panel data methodology, we analyze twenty five high-income and nineteen low-income economies for the periods of 1995-2012 and 1997-2009, respectively. We find reciprocal relationship between health expenditure and economic growth in the short run and one-way causality from economic growth to public health expenditure in the long-run. In high-income countries, there is a two-way causality for both private and public health expenditures in the short-run, while in the long-run there is a one-way causality between economic growth and private health expenditures. The crucial finding of this study is that private health expenditures have negative influence on economic growth while public health expenditures have both negative and statistically significant effect.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-015-9179-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27878709/,economics

Four main approaches can be used to calculate the incidental expenses; they differ in their methods of evaluation and assessment of health services. They all offer methods to calculate the anticipated costs and consequences. The methods include cost minimization analysis (CMA), cost effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost utility analysis (CUA) or cost benefit analysis (CBA). Many subgroups also exist.

"Background:
        
      
      In many countries with generic reference pricing, generic producers and distributors compete by means of undisclosed discounts offered to pharmacies in order to reduce acquisition costs and to induce them to dispense their generic to patients in preference over others.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this article is to test the hypothesis that under prevailing reference pricing systems for generic medicines, those medicines sold at a higher consumer price may enjoy a competitive advantage.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Real transaction prices for 179 generic medicines acquired by pharmacies in Spain have been used to calculate the discount rate on acquisition versus reimbursed costs to pharmacies. Two empirical hypotheses are tested: the discount rate at which pharmacies acquire generic medicines is higher for those pharmaceutical presentations for which there are more generic competitors; and, the discount rate at which pharmacies acquire generic medicines is higher for those pharmaceutical forms for which the consumer price has declined less in relation to the consumer price of the brand drug before generic entry (higher-priced generic medicines).
    


          Results:
        
      
      An average discount rate of 39.3% on acquisition versus reimbursed costs to pharmacies has been observed. The magnitude of the discount positively depends on the number of competitors in the market. The higher the ratio of the consumer price of the generic to that of the brand drug prior to generic entry (i.e. the smaller the price reduction of the generic in relation to the brand drug), the larger the discount rate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Under reference pricing there is intense price competition among generic firms in the form of unusually high discounts to pharmacies on official ex-factory prices reimbursed to pharmacies. However, this effect is highly distorting because it favours those medicines with a higher relative price in relation to the brand price before generic entry.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03261878,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22900924/,economics
"Importance:
        
      
      The timing of tracheostomy in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation is controversial. An important consideration that is currently missing in the literature is an evaluation of the economic impact of an early tracheostomy strategy vs a late tracheostomy strategy.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the early tracheostomy strategy vs the late tracheostomy strategy.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      This economic analysis was performed using a decision tree model with a 90-day time horizon. The economic perspective was that of the US health care third-party payer. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per tracheostomy avoided. Probabilities were obtained from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials. Costs were obtained from the published literature and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database. A multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to account for uncertainty surrounding mean values used in the reference case.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The reference case demonstrated that the cost of the late tracheostomy strategy was $45 943.81 for 0.36 of effectiveness. The cost of the early tracheostomy strategy was $31 979.12 for 0.19 of effectiveness. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the late tracheostomy strategy compared with the early tracheostomy strategy was $82 145.24 per tracheostomy avoided. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000, the early tracheostomy strategy is cost-effective with 56% certainty.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      The adaptation of an early vs a late tracheostomy strategy depends on the priorities of the decision-maker. Up to a willingness-to-pay threshold of $80 000 per tracheostomy avoided, the early tracheostomy strategy has a higher probability of being the more cost-effective intervention.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2016.1829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27468115/,economics
"Patients rank postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the top five most undesirable outcomes of surgery. Thirty percent of all surgical patients experience PONV. We conducted an economic study to determine the financial implications of providing surgical patients with PONV prophylaxis to increase patient satisfaction and minimize postoperative complications. Our main objective was to develop an economic model of PONV prophylaxis. We retrospectively reviewed all surgical cases who received care at our institution from June 2005 to June 2007 in which the surgical patient was billed for treatment of nausea and vomiting while in the hospital. The PONV risk factors for these patients were assessed as well as the revenue stream associated with those patients who returned to the hospital within 5 days with nausea and vomiting as their chief complaint. Of the total number of medical charts reviewed (56,532), 28 (1.57%) of 1783 patients who were billed for PONV while in the hospital returned to the hospital with PONV. The total billable charges for PONV for these returning patients were $83,674; the total reimbursements were $25,816 yielding a 31% reimbursement rate. The total hospital expenses were $24,123 yielding a net hospital profit of $1693 for treating these 28 patients. The average hospital cost and charge per antiemetic drug dose was $0.304 and $3.66, respectively. Using these figures, we determined that our hospital's net profit increases linearly with increased PONV prophylaxis administration. Our economic analysis shows that PONV prophylaxis is economically beneficial for the hospital when weighed against the expenses generated by treating patients returning to the hospital with PONV.",https://doi.org/10.1097/mjt.0b013e3181e7a512,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20634672/,economics
"Before pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing has a major impact on clinical practice, two levels of evidence must be generated. First, studies demonstrating the links between genetic variation and response to medications in defined populations are needed, along with development of valid tests to measure these specific variants. Second, studies should be conducted to evaluate whether PGx testing improves health outcomes for patients and whether the decision to test is cost-effective relative to usual care. This latter set of questions is typically of greatest relevance to clinicians and payers, the ultimate gatekeepers for the clinical integration of pharmacogenetics. To date, nearly all of the research efforts and funding for PGx have been focused on the first set of issues-getting the science right. However, now is the time to increase our research efforts on the second set of issues-to improve the PGx evidence base for both clinical and economic decision making.",https://doi.org/10.1038/clpt.2008.121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18679180/,economics
"Federal agencies in the USA pay significantly different prices for the same prescription drugs because each agency uses a different approach to derive the payment rate. Because we do not identify any economic rationale or socially accepted moral reasoning that would justify the current level of price variation, we suggest that the federal government should pay a uniform price for each drug. Laws and regulations that give certain federal agencies the ability to earn rebates, use formularies, or permit other special arrangements would need to be eliminated in order to have a single payment rate. This could make some government agencies worse off than others; however, a uniform payment rate would not need to affect beneficiaries' current financial contributions, access to drugs, benefits or overall public expenditures. At the same time, having a single rate would permit the government to adopt a more effective approach to purchasing drugs and send a consistent message to pharmaceutical companies concerning which types of drugs the government wants them to develop for government beneficiaries. How this single price would be derived and how it would compare with the lowest or highest prices currently achieved by government agencies would depend on a variety of policy issues including the government's desire to encourage pharmaceutical research and development and the need to control health care spending.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s174413310999034x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128956/,economics

"This article synthesizes and appraises the methodological quality of the international literature on costs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, economic value of antimicrobial therapy of exacerbations, and factors affecting the economic value of antibiotics. Included studies had carried out a cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility or cost-benefit analysis. Exacerbation costs varied between countries and increased with the severity of the exacerbation. Hospitalization costs accounted for more than 45% of healthcare costs of exacerbations. Drug costs made up 6-21% of healthcare costs in the majority of studies. Cost estimates were biased due to difficulties involved in diagnosing and treating exacerbations, and because the patient sample studied may not be representative of the population of patients suffering from exacerbations. Although this needs to be corroborated by future research, evidence is emerging that second-generation antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones may have a favourable economic profile as compared with first-generation antibiotics. The higher acquisition costs of fluoroquinolones appear to be balanced by less treatment failure, more time between exacerbation episodes, and lower hospitalization costs. There is a need for prospective economic evaluations alongside clinical trials with a sufficient number of patients and length of follow-up period. The economic value of antibiotics is influenced by difficulties involved in diagnosing the condition, effectiveness, resistance, patient compliance with treatment, and treatment failure associated with antibiotics. The small number of economic evaluations and their methodological limitations precludes the recommendation of a specific antibiotic for use in the management of COPD exacerbations on economic grounds.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2006.03.030,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16650975/,economics

The average charge for a kidney transplant is approximately $82,000. Graft and patient survival rates are highly variable, even among the most active programs in the US. Individual transplant programs must implement approaches to contain their costs and assure quality. At the Mayo Clinic, our mean charge for a kidney transplant ($53,510) in 1996 was 27.2% below expected, given national medical inflation over the past decade.

"Introduction:
        
      
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease. It is associated with a high personal burden of illness and economic consequences. Since AD can occur at any age, and many treatments and prevention options exist, a high diversity of health economic findings can be expected.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      A literature search was performed in January 2018 with the objective to report on previously published health economic analyses in AD. In total, 89 analyses were identified. Most analyses focused on the cost-of-illness (n = 34; 38%) followed by cost-utility and/or cost-effectiveness evaluations (n = 26; 29%) and cost analyses (n = 12; 13%) of treatments in AD. Further evaluations dealt with the prevention of AD (n = 13; 15%). Besides the different methods of health economic analyses, high variety was identified concerning the target population, comprised costs, effectiveness measures, comparators, and the modeling method.
    


          Expert commentary:
        
      
      Given the different health-care environments and methodologies chosen, health economic analyses in AD cannot be compared with each other and cannot be related to other landscapes of care. Nevertheless, the analyses identified give hint for a high socioeconomic impact of AD on the one hand and unmet needs from the patient perspective on the other.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2019.1549491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30590976/,economics

          Design:
        
      
      Medical center and physician charges obtained from billing records.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Academic health center.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Twenty-three consecutive patients undergoing lung volume reduction surgery at a single institution who were discharged from the hospital prior to November 1, 1995.
    


          Outcome measures:
        
      
      Length of hospital stay, mortality, medical center charges and professional fees, and sponsor reimbursement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median hospital stay was 8.0 days and there were no deaths. The median charge was $26,669 (range, $20,032 to $75,561) of which 73% was for medical center services and 27% was for physician services. Fees for medical center rooms and operating suite time accounted for 71% of medical center charges. Charges by surgeons and anesthesiologists accounted for 77% of professional fees. Total charges were directly related to length of stay (r2 = 0.95). Median reimbursement for medical center services was $22,264 (114%; range, $13,333 to $123,362) and for physician services was $2,783 (34%; range, $2,597 to $11,265), resulting in a median total reimbursement that represented 94% of total charges. The median reimbursement-to-cost ratio was 1.22, compared with 1.05 for all medical services in fiscal year 1995.

"Objectives:
        
      
      The objectives of this research were to: 1) understand perspectives on affordability of pharmaceutical drugs from the point of view of stakeholders as reported in published peer-reviewed journals and conferences; 2) evaluate if (and how) perspectives on affordability overlapped across stakeholders.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The systematic literature review followed Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Content analysis with iterative and systematic coding of text was conducted, to identify themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 7,372 unique citations were eligible, and 126 articles included for final synthesis. For patients, 6 core themes emerged: financial barriers, adherence, access, patient-provider communication, financial distress, and factors that impact affordability. For payers, 5 core themes: financing schemes, cost-effectiveness, budget impact, private vs. public preferences, and ethics. For providers, 3 themes: patient-provider communication, physician prescribing behavior, and finding alternatives to support patient access. For policymakers, 2 themes: measuring affordability and the role of government. Limited articles representing the manufacturer perspective were identified. Perspectives of decision makers (payers, policymakers) did not overlap with those affected by affordability (patients, providers).

          Results:
        
      
      This article discusses the methodology for the following types of economic evaluations: cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, and economic modeling. Topics include health-state utility measures, the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), uncertainty analysis, discounting, decision tree analysis, and Markov modeling.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences. With increasing health care expenditure and limited resources, it is important for physicians to consider the economic impact of their interventions. Understanding common methodology involved in health economic evaluation will improve critical appraisal of the literature and optimize future economic evaluations.",https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.23943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23483522/,economics
"Despite growing documentation that the conditions needed to support competition in health care do not exist, consumer-directed health care has been offered as the new market-based solution to cost inflation. Yet typical consumer-based insurance products undermine the very logic of expecting consumers to make good health care decisions by making preventive services--the category of services about which consumers are best able to make informed decisions using their own money--exempt from cost sharing. Consumer-directed care threatens important societal values--in particular, the goal of establishing relationships between patients and clinical professionals based on trust.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16284025/,economics
"The past decade witnessed a dramatic increase in inpatient hospital payment rates for patients with private insurance relative to payment rates for those covered by Medicare. A natural question is whether the widening private-Medicare payment rate difference had implications for the hospital care received by patients just before and after turning 65-the age at which there is a substantial shift from private to Medicare coverage. Using a large discharge dataset covering the period 2001-2011, we tracked changes at age 65 in the following dimensions of hospital care: overall hospitalization rates, case mix, referral-sensitive surgeries, length of stay, full established charges, number of procedures, mortality, and composite measures of inpatient quality and patient safety. In all cases we found either no change or a change that was small and inconsistent with payment rate changes during the study period.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10754-018-9240-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29696508/,economics
"One of the components in China's massive health reform effort is the New Cooperative Medical Scheme, which is intended to provide affordable health insurance, especially to the rural poor. This program offers three options with different benefits and costs to county health officials, who select one of the options to make available to local residents. Data were obtained from the New Cooperative Medical Scheme survey conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Health and the World Bank in 2005, which covered more than 47,000 people living in twenty-seven counties, to determine participation levels, identify which option was most attractive, and characterize the impact that each option had on care and costs. Our study found that those participants with the most limited coverage might have delayed seeking care, while the broadest coverage--the ""Cadillac option""--was the most popular. Yet if this generous package were to be broadly offered, health costs would become unsustainable. Therefore, the Chinese government must consider which costs to cover for people in economically depressed rural areas.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22566447/,economics
"Empirical research has shown that households in developing countries are unable to sustain current levels of consumption during and after severe health crises due to substantial increase in medical expenditure and/or loss of income. Health events are also found to have an adverse impact on nutritional status and educational attainment of household members. Thus, in this study, we investigate: who are vulnerable to welfare loss from health shocks, what are the household responses to cope with the economic burden of health shocks and if policy responses like state health insurance schemes are effective in reducing the economic vulnerability. We use self-reported measures of health shocks and coping strategies from the longitudinal survey of the ongoing Young Lives project in India [Andhra Pradesh (AP)] to identify the characteristics of vulnerable groups and perform three-level random intercept logistic regression that takes into account contextual or environmental factors. What emerges is socioeconomic status of household (determined by education, wealth, occupation and caste/religious group) and its demographic characteristics like gender of the household head and proportion of elderly and disabled members matter for outcomes related to health events. Households adopt different strategies to cope with the economic costs of ill-health; borrowing is the most widely used strategy. For credit, majority of households rely on informal sources (moneylenders, friends, relatives, etc.) and have little or no access to formal sources. However, health shock to main breadwinner leads to households adopting costly strategies like reducing consumption or sending children to work. We found no evidence that the state health insurance scheme reduced the household welfare loss from health shocks and their coping strategies. The results suggest that health insurance schemes have to be complemented with access to micro-credit and social security schemes for self-employed persons/workers in informal sector to reduce the economic burden faced by households due to health shocks.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czv127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26838795/,economics
"Aims:
        
      
      To estimate health expenditures due to diabetes in 2014 for the world and its regions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Diabetes-attributable health expenditures were estimated using an attributable fraction method. Data were sourced from International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates of diabetes prevalence, UN population projections, WHO annual health expenditure reports, and estimates of the cost ratio of people with and without diabetes. Health expenditures were calculated in both US dollars (USD) and international dollars (ID).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average health expenditure per person with diabetes worldwide in 2014 was estimated to range from USD 1583 (ID 1742) to USD 2842 (ID 3110). The estimated annual global health expenditure attributable to diabetes ranged from USD 612 billion (ID 673 billion) to USD 1099 billion (ID 1202 billion). Together, the North America and Caribbean Region and the Europe Region were responsible for over 69% of the costs, and less than 10% of the costs were from the Africa Region, South East Asia Region, and Middle East and North Africa Region combined. The North America and Caribbean Region had the highest annual spending per person with diabetes (USD 7984 [ID 8040.39]), while the South East Asia Region had the lowest annual spending per person with diabetes (USD 92 [ID 234]).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Diabetes imposes a large economic burden on health care systems across the world, yet varies across world regions. Diabetes prevention and effective management of diabetes should be a public health priority to reduce the financial burden.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2016.04.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27329022/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      At present, the diagnosis-related groups-based prospective payment system (DRG-PPS) that has been implemented in China is merely a prototype called the simplified DRG-PPS, which is known as the 'ceiling price for a single disease'. Given that studies on the effects of a simplified DRG-PPS in China have usually been controversial, we aim to synthesize evidence examining whether DRGs can reduce medical costs and length of stay (LOS) in China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were searched from both Chinese [Wan Fang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI)] and international databases (Web of Science and PubMed), as well as the official websites of Chinese health departments in the 2004-2016 period. Only studies with a design that included both experimental (with DRG-PPS implementation) and control groups (without DRG-PPS implementation) were included in the review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The studies were based on inpatient samples from public hospitals distributed in 12 provinces of mainland China. Among them, 80.95% (17/21) revealed that hospitalization costs could be reduced significantly, and 50.00% (8/16) indicated that length of stay could be decreased significantly. In addition, the government reports showed the enormous differences in pricing standards and LOS in various provinces, even for the same disease.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We conclude that the simplified DRGs are useful in controlling hospitalization costs, but they fail to reduce LOS. Much work remains to be done in China to improve the simplified DRG-PPS.",https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihx030,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28911128/,economics
"It is well-known that financial asset returns exhibit fat-tailed distributions and long-term memory. These empirical features are the main objectives of modeling efforts using (i) stochastic processes to quantitatively reproduce these features and (ii) agent-based simulations to understand the underlying microscopic interactions. After reviewing selected empirical and theoretical evidence documenting the behavior of traders, we construct an agent-based model to quantitatively demonstrate that ""fat"" tails in return distributions arise when traders share similar technical trading strategies and decisions. Extending our behavioral model to a stochastic model, we derive and explain a set of quantitative scaling relations of long-term memory from the empirical behavior of individual market participants. Our analysis provides a behavioral interpretation of the long-term memory of absolute and squared price returns: They are directly linked to the way investors evaluate their investments by applying technical strategies at different investment horizons, and this quantitative relationship is in agreement with empirical findings. Our approach provides a possible behavioral explanation for stochastic models for financial systems in general and provides a method to parameterize such models from market data rather than from statistical fitting.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1205013109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22586086/,economics
"This paper investigates whether choice of health insurance is influenced by the perceived mental and physical health of family members among a sample of policy-holders with private health insurance. A multinomial probit model of the choice among major medical coverage only, traditional full coverage, and coverage through a health maintenance organization is estimated. Results indicate that the presence of at least one family member who rates his or her general health as poor does not affect the policy-holder's choice of health insurance. However, the presence of at least one family member considered at risk of mental illness does in some instances affect the policy-holder's choice of health insurance: We observe significant effects for policy-holders who are female, black, have some college education, work for a large firm, and live in an urban area. These findings suggest that adverse selection may arise when individuals are able to choose between health insurance policies with different degrees of coverage for mental health care and that such effects are far more pronounced for those people who consider themselves at risk for mental illness than physical illness.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199601)5:1<61::aid-hec180>3.0.co;2-q,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653192/,economics
"We investigate the economic hubs and authorities of the world trade network (WTN) from 1992 to 2012, an era of rapid economic globalization. Using a well-defined weighted hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm, we can calculate the values of the weighted HITS hub and authority for each country in a conjugate way. In the context of the WTN, authority values are large for countries with significant imports from large hub countries, and hub values are large for countries with significant exports to high-authority countries. The United States was the largest economic authority in the WTN from 1992 to 2012. The authority value of the United States has declined since 2001, and China has now become the largest hub in the WTN. At the same time, China's authority value has grown as China is transforming itself from the ""factory of the world"" to the ""market of the world."" European countries show a tendency to trade mostly within the European Union, which has decreased Europe's hub and authority values. Japan's authority value has increased slowly, while its hub value has declined. These changes are consistent with Japan's transition from being an export-driven economy in its high economic growth era in the latter half of the twentieth century to being a more mature, economically balanced nation.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100338,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25050940/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Regional variations in hospital billing for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have been reported. It is not clear whether differences exist in hospital charges for TJA based on hospital profit status.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs) 469 (TJA with comorbidity) and 470 (TJA without comorbidity) for fiscal year 2011 were analyzed. Differences in hospital charges and payments were investigated based on hospital profit status (nonprofit, government, and proprietary). Generalized estimating equations determined differences in charges and reimbursement between hospital types controlling for census region, MS-DRG, and number of discharges.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significant differences in billing between institutions existed with median average hospital charges for nonprofit, government, and proprietary institutions being $70,514.30, $73,540.99, and $113,203.77 (P < .0001), respectively, for DRG 469 and $45,363.95, $44,956.57, and $62,715.39 (P < .0001), respectively, for DRG 470. Median average Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services payments for nonprofit, government, and proprietary institutions for DRG 469 were $22,334.34, $21,346.65, and $21,281.30 (P = .017), respectively, and $14,461.95, $14,466.04, and $13,733.62 (P < .0001), respectively, for DRG 470. Multivariate analyses indicate that nonprofit hospitals charge 5% more (P = .021) and receive 3% less (P = .011) reimbursement than government hospitals. Proprietary hospitals charge 34% more (P < .0001) and receive 7% less (P < .0001) reimbursement than government hospitals.
    


          Conclusion:

"Aims:
        
      
      Relatively little is known about patterns of injury at the community level in Vietnam and their economic consequences. This study sought to estimate the costs of various unintentional injuries in Bavi District during one year; to describe how costs depended on gender, age, circumstances, and severity of injury; and to describe how the economic burden of unintentional injuries was distributed between households, government, and health insurance agency.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cohort study was undertaken, which involved four cross-sectional household surveys among sampled communities in the Bavi District during the year 2000, each asking about injuries in the preceding three months. The costing system in public healthcare in Vietnam was applied as well as information from the victims.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total cost of injuries over one year in Bavi District was estimated to be D3,412,539,000 (Vietnamese dong) (US$235,347), equivalent to the annual income of 1,800 people. In total, 90% of this economic burden fell on households, only 8% on government, and 2% on the health insurance agency. The cost of a severe injury to the corresponded to approximately seven months of earned income. Home and traffic injuries together accounted for more than 80% of the total cost, 45% and 38% respectively. The highest unit cost was related to traffic injuries, followed by home, ""other"", work-related, and school injuries in descending order.
    


          Discussion:

"The authors consider an integrated income and disability annuity as an alternative framework for long-term care financing, show that pooling disability and mortality risks can reduce the need for medical underwriting, and discuss private and public implications. Data from the National Mortality Followback Survey of 1986 were used to simulate current underwriting and minimal underwriting, excluding only those already eligible for benefits. Remaining disability, life expectancy, and premiums are compared under both underwriting assumptions. Under minimal underwriting, 98% of persons age 65 would be eligible to purchase disability protection through an integrated annuity, versus 77% under current underwriting. Premiums for both the income and disability components were lower with minimal underwriting. Combining income and disability protection may be able to expand private markets for long-term care financing beyond what appears possible in the long-term care insurance market. Public policy should avoid the distortion of choices created by focusing exclusively on an insurance model.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0898264302239014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12611402/,economics
"In this Health Policy we examine the association between the financing structure of health systems and universal health coverage. Latin American health systems encompass a wide range of financial sources, which translate into different solidarity-based schemes that combine contributory (payroll taxes) and non-contributory (general taxes) sources of financing. To move towards universal health coverage, solidarity-based schemes must heavily rely on countries' capacity to increase public expenditure in health. Improvement of solidarity-based schemes will need the expansion of mandatory universal insurance systems and strengthening of the public sector including increased fiscal expenditure. These actions demand a new model to integrate different sources of health-sector financing, including general tax revenue, social security contributions, and private expenditure. The extent of integration achieved among these sources will be the main determinant of solidarity and universal health coverage. The basic challenges for improvement of universal health coverage are not only to spend more on health, but also to reduce the proportion of out-of-pocket spending, which will need increased fiscal resources.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61780-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25458734/,economics
"Lack of access to affordable capital is a formidable barrier that compromises rural health care infrastructure development in poor rural areas. Commercial lending institutions are often limited in their ability to respond to those needs due to traditional lending criteria: creditworthiness, equity, management ability, experiences, and cash flow or profits. In the Southern Rural Access Program, a development model more frequently used in other sectors has been successfully applied to health care to help clear these hurdles. This paper describes the 5 operational loan funds in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and West Virginia receiving support from the Southern Rural Access Program. Two models of loan funds have evolved: those led by health agencies and those led by community development finance institutions whose mission is rural economic development. This paper outlines major distinctive features of these 2 approaches and describes major implementation challenges these loan funds face. Key accomplishments are high-lighted, including the ability to leverage additional resources from state, federal, philanthropic, and private sources through these funds. These loan fund programs provide models for other states interested in improving access to capital to help build the rural health care infrastructure while making health care more economically viable through integration with other community development initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2003.tb01059.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14526523/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Suboptimal compliance and failure to persist with drug treatments are important determinants of therapeutic nonresponse and are of potential economic significance. The present article aims to describe the methodologies that may be appropriate for integrating noncompliance and nonpersistence in economic evaluations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE and NHS-EED were searched for economic evaluations published in the period between 1997 and 2005. Articles were included if they explored the dependence of cost-effectiveness results on varying levels of some form of compliance-related measure. The different methodologies used were reviewed and articles were appraised critically. Alternative methodological approaches are proposed, illustrated by an example of the impact of different persistence rates on a treatment's cost-effectiveness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ten articles were selected for inclusion. These were generally scant on detail relating to how compliance/persistence was assessed and what the impact was on health outcomes. The methods used included Markov models and decision analyses. Markov models allow for persistence to be included directly in the analysis, as patients transit during each cycle. Net-benefit regression models are well suited for analyzing prospective and retrospective studies where patient-level data are available, whereas discrete event simulations have the potential to offer more flexibility.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Compliance and/or persistence are not included routinely in pharmacoeconomic analyses, despite their potential impact. Where compliance and/or persistence are included, a lack of methodological rigor and consistency in definitions often limits the usefulness of the analyses. The analytical techniques discussed in this article should serve as a basis for developing guidelines on appropriate methodology.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00205.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17970932/,economics

We refute their claim about the equivalence of HYEs and QALYs; they fail to distinguish between choice under uncertainty and under certainty. CW assume that all individuals have a specific form of utility function, which yields their conclusion of equivalence. B's arguments confuse the measurement technique and the utility theory from which it stems; his argument about the normative superiority of the QALY construct is inconsistent with economic thinking.

"Background:
        
      
      The proportion of total healthcare expenditures spent on drugs has continued to grow in countries of all income categories. Policy-makers are under pressure to control pharmaceutical expenditures without adversely affecting quality of care. Financial incentives seeking to influence prescribers' behaviour include budgetary arrangements at primary care and hospital settings (pharmaceutical budget caps or targets), financial rewards for target behaviours or outcomes (pay for performance interventions) and reduced benefit margin for prescribers based on medicine sales and prescriptions (pharmaceutical reimbursement rate reduction policies). This is the first update of the original version of this review.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To determine the effects of pharmaceutical policies using financial incentives to influence prescribers' practices on drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes and costs (expenditures).
    


          Search methods:
        
      
      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (searched 29/01/2015); MEDLINE, Ovid SP (searched 29/01/2015); EMBASE, Ovid SP (searched 29/01/2015); International Network for Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD) Bibliography (searched 29/01/2015); National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database (searched 29/01/2015); EconLit - ProQuest (searched 02/02/2015); and Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge (citation search for included studies searched 10/02/2015). We screened the reference lists of relevant reports and contacted study authors and organisations to identify additional studies.
    


          Selection criteria:
        
      
      We included policies that intend to affect prescribing by means of financial incentives for prescribers. Included in this category are pharmaceutical budget caps or targets, pay for performance and drug reimbursement rate reductions and other financial policies, if they were specifically targeted at prescribing or drug utilisation. Policies in this review were defined as laws, rules, regulations and financial and administrative orders made or implemented by payers such as national or local governments, non-government organisations, private or social insurers and insurance-like organisations. One of the following outcomes had to be reported: drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes or costs. The study had to be a randomised or non-randomised trial, an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis, a repeated measures study or a controlled before-after (CBA) study.
    


          Data collection and analysis:
        
      
      At least two review authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion of studies and risks of bias using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria and extracted data from the included studies. For CBA studies, we reported relative effects (e.g. adjusted relative change). The review team re-analysed all ITS results. When possible, the review team also re-analysed CBA data as ITS data.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      Eighteen evaluations (six new studies) of pharmaceutical policies from six high-income countries met our inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies evaluated pharmaceutical budget policies in the UK (nine studies), two in Germany and Ireland and one each in Sweden and Taiwan. Three studies assessed pay for performance policies in the UK (two) and the Netherlands (one). One study from Taiwan assessed a reimbursement rate reduction policy. ITS analyses had some limitations. All CBA studies had serious limitations. No study from low-income or middle-income countries met the inclusion criteria.Pharmaceutical budgets may lead to a modest reduction in drug use (median relative change -2.8%; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of the policy on drug costs or healthcare utilisation, as the certainty of such evidence has been assessed as very low. Effects of this policy on health outcomes were not reported. Effects of pay for performance policies on drug use and health outcomes are uncertain, as the certainty of such evidence has been assessed as very low. Effects of this policy on drug costs and healthcare utilisation have not been measured. Effects of the reimbursement rate reduction policy on drug use and drug costs are uncertain, as the certainty of such evidence has been assessed as very low. No included study assessed the effects of this policy on healthcare utilisation or health outcomes. Administration costs of the policies were not reported in any of the included studies.
    


          Authors' conclusions:
        
      
      Although financial incentives are considered an important element in strategies to change prescribing patterns, limited evidence of their effects can be found. Effects of policies, including pay for performance policies, in improving quality of care and health outcomes remain uncertain. Because pharmaceutical policies have uncertain effects, and because they might cause harm as well as benefit, proper evaluation of these policies is needed. Future studies should consider the impact of these policies on health outcomes, drug use and overall healthcare expenditures, as well as on drug expenditures.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006731.pub2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26239041/,economics
"The cost of treatments especially in conditions where multiresistant bacteria are involved are a major issue in times where in most developed countries in the world payment systems based on diagnoses-related-groups (DRG) are in place. There is great evidence that especially the length of stay in hospital (LOS), the time in the intensive care unit (ICU-days) and the hours of mechanical ventilation (HMV) are major cost drivers. - While established methods of pharmacoeconomical analyses focus on the efficiency of drugs from healthcare system perspective, these data are often not sufficient for improving treatment strategies in a given hospital context. - We developed a system that allows the analysis of patients with severe infections on the basis of routine data that is also used for reimbursement. These data contain a lot of information concerning the clinical conditions. By using the ICD-coding we developed an algorithm which allows the detection of patients with infections and gives information on the potential financial outcome of these patients. By using the analysis it is possible to identify subsets of infections and the patient records that had a potentially negative DRG-result, i.e. the costs are higher than the reimbursement. When identified the patient records undergo a peer review, where the clinical situation and the antibiotic therapy are reviewed by medical experts. In case simulations it is possible to find out if a different therapeutic approach, e.g. by different choices in initial (empirical) antibiotic treatment would have caused other outcomes. - Data driven analyses together with peer reviews of patient records are a useful tool to examine antibiotic treatment strategies and to establish changes that again can be reviewed on a regular basis. Doing this a continous improvement process can be established in hospitals which can lead to a better balance of clinical and economical outcomes in patients with severe infections. Moreover these analyses are helpful in assessing the literature on economical benefits of new therapies.",https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-783x-15-12-564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21163731/,economics
"This paper investigates the structure of a National Health Service in which there is compulsory social insurance covering a package of essentials, a given part of individuals' health expenditure, and supplementary private policy topping up the remaining services. The latter insurance contract provides for a co-payment by patients, limiting the so-called ""third-party payer"" effect. Thus, an individual's health expenditure is divided into three parts: the first covered by social insurance, the second by a private policy and the third out-of-pocket. Such mixed system design has received increasing attention in recent years and has been adopted by several industrialized countries. The conditions for optimal rates of social insurance coverage and of private coinsurance are analysed and discussed. The optimality requirements refer to efficiency as well as equity concerns.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(99)00017-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10847932/,economics
"This paper gives a systematic overview of resource use that is relevant within the German health-care system from the perspective of the statutory health insurance and how these resource uses should be priced in economic analyses. This includes all relevant cost domains from ambulatory and inpatient care as well as a detailed description of relevant data resulting from drug usage. For prescriptions the legal framework (e.g., reference pricing) is applied to list all relevant co-payments or discounts (e.g., for pharmaceutical companies) which have to be considered in patented as well as off-patent drugs. The same method is applied for ambulatory services [taking the universal remuneration scheme (EBM) into account] as well as for inpatient stays (discussing certain characteristics of the German DRG system). As a result, for the first time, a pragmatic as well as a practical approach is presented to value resource usage within the German health care system in future studies from the perspective of the statutory health insurance or, in other words, the sickness funds.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0028-1102930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19173145/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this discussion document is to consider the potential benefits of collaborations between universities and industry. Universities and industry now exist in a harsh and competitive economic climate. Indeed, their very survival depends increasingly on their ability and willingness to adapt to an unprecedented pace of change. There are a number of compelling reasons for universities and industry to undertake collaborative research. The costs of research have escalated. Universities, of necessity, are increasingly seeking financial support from industry as conventional sources of funding have been systematically reduced. Companies can no longer be self sufficient in terms of the science and technology needed for success. The strength of universities is their science base, and industry recognizes that the rapid exploitation of scientific advances is the key to its survival. Both organizations can benefit from collaborative research programmes. Universities are able to make additional staff appointments which add to their intellectual resource and reputation. In addition the purchase of equipment enhances their infrastructure.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Industry has the opportunity to recognize the potential relevance and value of funded research and must harness and commercially exploit new knowledge as rapidly as possible. Ultimately such collaboration will give rise to new approaches to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of dental diseases with benefits to all concerned.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-5712(95)00005-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8636489/,economics
"Use of the producer price index; data from independent sources, drug industry analyst, group purchasing organizations (GPOs), and health maintenance organizations (HMOs); pharmacoeconomics; and legal developments to project drug expenditures and prepare pharmacy budgets for 1997 is discussed. The producer price index indicates that prices for drugs and pharmaceuticals increased 2.2% during January to May 1996; the increase for prescription preparations was 3.4%. Medi-Span reports an average increase for all drug products of 1.2% for the first six months of 1996. IMS America data show the price of all drugs increasing 1.8% between the second quarters of 1995 and 1996. Drug industry analysts project the overall price increase in the next 12 months at 2.5-5.0%. GPOs predict an average increase over the next 12 months of 2.2% for contracted drugs and 4.3% for non-contracted drugs. HMO pharmacy directors predict pharmacy expenditures will increase by 4.5% per member in 1997. Caution must be applied in using pharmacoeconomics to project drug costs and their impact on health care expenditures. Today's budget must account for the greater integration of drug expenditures into the institution's objectives, possible reductions in other service costs, capitation, competition, shifting of control of the drug budget to specific patient care centers, relocation of services to the ambulatory care setting, and outsourcing. Legal actions in 1996 that may affect price increases and drug budgets included a class-action lawsuit by community and chain pharmacies alleging price discrimination by manufactures and wholesalers. Prices of pharmaceutical products are fairly stable and may remain so in 1997, but projections of future drug expenditures must account for the continuing reshaping of the health care landscape.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/54.2.153,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9117803/,economics
"To detail the cost for one year of a chronic disease, 50 patients with Stage III rheumatoid arthritis were surveyed. Direct medical costs for this group were three times the national average, and 58% of these costs were covered by insurance. Indirect costs due to lost income were at least three times the direct medical costs, and transfer payments covered only 42% of these costs. Fifty-eight percent of the study group also sustained a major psychosocial loss. Uncovered income losses were the greatest economic burden for individuals with chronic rheumatoid arthritis.

"We examined the differences in the economic performance of 80 matched pairs of investor-owned chain and not-for-profit hospitals in eight states during 1978 and 1980, and considered how their operating strategies might affect their relative success in a more price-conscious market. We found that total charges (adjusted for case mix) and net revenues per case were both significantly higher in the investor-owned chain hospitals, mainly because of higher charges for ancillary services; there were no significant differences between the two groups of hospitals in regard to patient-care costs per case (adjusted for case mix), but the investor-owned hospitals had significantly higher administrative overhead costs; investor-owned hospitals were more profitable; investor-owned hospitals had fewer employees per occupied bed but paid more per employee; investor-owned hospitals had funded more of their capital through debt and had significantly higher capital costs in proportion to their operating costs; and the two groups did not differ in patient mix, as measured by their Medicare case-mix indexes or the proportions of their patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid. We conclude that investor-owned chain hospitals generated higher profits through more aggressive pricing practices rather than operating efficiencies - a result not unexpected in view of past cost-based reimbursement policies. Recent changes in these policies are creating new pressures for cost control and moderation in charges, to which both types of hospitals must adapt. Neither type has a clear-cut advantage in the ability to make the necessary changes.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198601093140206,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3941696/,economics
"Spent hydroprocessing catalysts from refineries have been classified as hazardous solid waste by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), refiners must find a viable but economical solution to solve this serious environmental issue. Catalyst rejuvenation is an attractive option for minimizing the environmental problems associated with spent catalysts. In this study, a preliminary design for such a process and the corresponding economic analysis are performed to assess the proposed catalyst rejuvenation process for metal-fouled spent catalysts generated in residue hydroprocessing units. The scenarios used in the economic assessment are based on three options of process synthesis and two operator modes. It is found that the option of rejuvenating medium and lightly fouled spent catalyst produced by the refinery will be the best solution for refiners, both environmentally and economically.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2006.12.017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17316960/,economics
"Introduction: The estimates of the economic burden of smoking provide the basis for a comprehensive assessment of the overall economic impact and evidence for potential public health policy intervention by the government. The aim of this paper is to estimate the smoking-attributable direct healthcare expenditure covered by the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (CHIF) in Lithuania in 2013. Methods: A prevalence-based and disease-specific annual cost approach was applied to 25 smoking-related diseases or disease categories. Our analysis included only direct government healthcare expenditure (reimbursed by CHIF), including: smoking-attributable outpatient and inpatient care services, medical rehabilitation, reimbursable and publicly procured pharmaceuticals and medical aids, the emergency medical aid (ambulance) service, nursing, and expensive tests and procedures. The smoking-attributable expenditure on the above-mentioned healthcare services was calculated by multiplying the total annual expenditure by the corresponding smoking attributable fractions (SAFs). Results: The total smoking-attributable government expenditure amounted to €37.4 million in 2013. This represented 3% of the total CHIF budget in 2013. Smoking-attributable expenditure on inpatient care and medical rehabilitation services was two times higher for male smokers, than for female smokers. Conclusions: Smoking imposes a significant preventable financial cost within the budget of the Lithuanian healthcare system. A quantitative estimation of smoking related healthcare costs could provide an incentive for the development of smoking cessation services, with additional attention towards male smokers, as well as an important focus on smoking prevention among children and youths.",https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina54020015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30344246/,economics
"The consequences of consumer-driven health care under different health insurance plans are studied by means of a game theoretic approach. Suitable demand-side cost-sharing can induce consumer behavior that avoids over-treatment when there are information asymmetries between providers and consumers, leading to the efficient recommendations and provision of treatment by providers. If under-treatment can be penalized, then a full insurance model that pays providers a fixed salary and fee-for-service or one that requires patients to present a referral letter before specialist care is delivered also achieves provision efficiency. The two models, however, yield higher welfare for consumers. Hence, the findings in this paper favor some amount of regulation in health-care markets.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-009-0158-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19529966/,economics

Using a model of plan choice and medical utilization, we present evidence of heterogeneous moral hazard as well as selection on it, and explore some of its implications.

"Concentration among physician groups has been steadily increasing, which may affect prices for physician services. We assessed the relationship in 2010 between physician competition and prices paid by private preferred provider organizations for fifteen common, high-cost procedures to understand whether higher concentration of physician practices and accompanying increased market power were associated with higher prices for services. Using county-level measures of the concentration of physician practices and county average prices, and statistically controlling for a range of other regional characteristics, we found that physician practice concentration and prices were significantly associated for twelve of the fifteen procedures we studied. For these procedures, counties with the highest average physician concentrations had prices 8-26 percent higher than prices in the lowest counties. We concluded that physician competition is frequently associated with prices. Policies that would influence physician practice organization should take this into consideration.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26438753/,economics

"As is true for most aspects of the US health care system, we pay much more for medications than do patients in any other country. Not only are new ""breakthrough"" products expensive, but existing products see price increases that regularly outstrip general inflation, making the pharmaceutical industry very profitable and resulting in many patients skipping or cutting the doses of such critical medicines as insulin. There is little relation between the effectiveness and the price of many medications. Drug firms like to cite the high cost of research and development but spend more on marketing than on research and development. The firms also spend large sums on lobbying and to influence medical thought leaders to keep their profits high. We are alone in spending billions of dollars on pharmacy benefit managers that add little value.

"Background:
        
      
      An exclusive human milk diet (EHMD) using human milk based products (pre-term formula and fortifiers) has been shown to lead to significant clinical benefits for very low birth weight (VLBW) babies (below 1250 g). This is expensive relative to diets that include cow's milk based products, but preliminary economic analyses have shown that the costs are more than offset by a reduction in the cost of neonatal care. However, these economic analyses have not completely assessed the economic implications of EHMD feeding, as they have not considered the range of outcomes affected by it.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted an economic analysis of EHMD compared to usual practice of care amongst VLBW babies in the US, which is to include cow's milk based products when required. Costs were evaluated from the perspective of the health care payer, with societal costs considered in sensitivity analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An EHMD substantially reduces mortality and improves other health outcomes, as well as generating substantial cost savings of $16,309 per infant by reducing adverse clinical events. Cost savings increase to $117,239 per infant when wider societal costs are included.
    


          Conclusions:

"Medicare's experience with balance billing provides valuable lessons for policy making for national or state health care reform. Medicare developed several policies to encourage physicians to become participating providers who accept Medicare-allowed charges as payment in full. Only nonparticipating physicians are permitted to bill for additional amounts beyond that paid by Medicare, and there are limits on the amount of balance billing per claim. As shown by the analysis of claims presented in this article, Medicare has successfully provided financial protection to beneficiaries. In 1986, more than 60 percent of expenditures for physician services were on assigned claims for which there could be no balance billing; by 1990, 80 percent of expenditures were on assigned claims. Balance billing decreased by about 30 percent during the same period. Although these policies have been successful in reducing total expenditures for balance billing, they may not provide financial protection to the most economically vulnerable beneficiaries. Using survey and claims data, we found that the poor have lower balance billing expenditures for services provided by primary care physicians, but that there is no relationship between poverty status and balance billing expenditures for services of nonprimary care physicians. In addition, most low-income beneficiaries are liable for balance bills. Under health care reform, adoption of Medicare's incentive-based approach with mandatory assignment for the poor would allow for some choice based on price and would provide financial protection for all consumers.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-20-1-49,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7738321/,economics
"Oman is a Middle Eastern country that has traditionally been monotonically reliant on its indigenous fossil fuel supplies. Besides, the nation has also been a surplus producer and net exporter of oil which further highlights the prolonged fossil fuel dependency of Oman. Consequently, despite flourishing economically, environmental quality in Oman has persistently aggravated. These opposing economic and environmental performances have necessitated Oman to identify the factors which can enable Oman to decarbonize its economy for tackling the environmental concerns faced by the nation. Against this backdrop, this study aims to examine the symmetric and asymmetric effects of foreign direct investments, economic growth, and capital investments on carbon dioxide emissions in Oman during 1980-2019. Using relevant econometric estimation methods for controlling structural break concerns in the data, the findings reveal evidence of asymmetric environmental impacts associated with shocks to the nation's foreign direct investment inflow, economic growth, and capital investment figures. Specifically, it is witnessed that positive shocks to the levels of foreign direct investment inflows, economic growth, and capital investments boost carbon dioxide emissions both in the short and long run. On the other hand, negative shocks to the levels of foreign direct investment inflows and economic growth are witnessed to reduce the emissions. Besides, the findings also validate the environmental Kuznets curve and pollution haven hypotheses in the context of Oman. Hence, considering these key findings, it is recommended that Oman should ideally pursues green economic growth policies by restricting inflows of unclean foreign direct investments and green its financial sector in order to collectively minimize its carbon dioxide emission figures.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17246-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34782975/,economics

"Like other countries, Australia has had some success in incorporating economic evidence into national healthcare decisions. However, it has been recognised that this coverage does not extend to the local hospital or health region level. An extensive body of research has identified barriers to the use of economic evidence at the local level, leading some commentators to suggest that economic evaluation should only be targeted at national decision-making bodies. Yet, local decision makers in Australia and elsewhere make important choices about the uptake and diffusion of healthcare technologies. We propose a number of interrelated options to address the barriers that currently prohibit the use of economic evaluation by local decision makers in many jurisdictions. These include wider dissemination of user friendly models, inclusion of assessments of the cost impact of interventions on various budgets, and the establishment of an authoritative body that ensures the production of high quality economic models. It is argued that these options can have a significant impact on the way economic evaluations are conducted, reported, disseminated and used.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200725120-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18047389/,economics

"It has been argued that activity based payment systems make hospitals focus on the diagnostic groups that are most beneficial given costs and reimbursement rates. This article tests this hypothesis by exploring the relationship between changes in the reimbursement rates and changes in the number of registered treatment episodes for all diagnosis-related groups in Norway between 2006 and 2013. The number of treatment episodes can be affected by many factors and in order to isolate the effect of changes in the reimbursement system, we exclude DRGs affected by policy reforms and administrative changes. The results show that hospitals increased the number of admissions in a specific DRG four times more when the reimbursement was increased, relative to the change for DRGs with reduced rates. The direction of the result was consistent across time periods and sub-groups such as surgical vs. medical, and inpatient vs. outpatient DRGs. The effect was smaller, but remained significant after eliminating DRGs that were most likely to be affected by upcoding. Activities that the hospital had little control over, such as the number of births, had small effects, while activity levels in more discretionary categories, for instance mental diseases, were more affected. This demonstrates that contrary to the wishes of policy makers the economic incentives affect hospital reporting and priority setting behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.07.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567179/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      In the majority of clinical trials patients are randomised equally between treatment groups. This approach maximises statistical power for a given total sample size. The objectives of this paper were to determine if, when research costs between treatments differ, it is more economically efficient to randomise additional patients to the cheaper treatment, and how the optimum randomisation ratio can be estimated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Estimation of the most economically efficient randomisation ratio for four hypothetical clinical trials using cost-effectiveness analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      When research costs differ between treatments, and there is no constraint on total sample size, it is always more cost-effective to randomise more patients to the cheaper treatment. For example, a cost ratio between the lesser and more expensive treatment of ten, results in a randomisation ratio of 3.2:1.

"Background:
        
      
      Policymakers stimulate competition in universalistic health-care systems while encouraging the formation of service provision networks among hospital organizations. This article addresses a gap in the extant literature by empirically analyzing simultaneous collaboration and competition between hospitals within the Italian National Health Service, where important procompetition reforms have been implemented.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To explore how rising competition between hospitals relates to their propensity to collaborate with other local providers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Longitudinal data on interhospital collaboration and competition collected in an Italian region from 2003 to 2007 are analyzed. Social network analysis techniques are applied to study the structure and dynamics of interhospital collaboration. Negative binomial regressions are employed to explore how interhospital competition relates to the collaborative network over time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Competition among providers does not hinder interhospital collaboration. Collaboration is primarily local, with resource complementarity and differentials in the volume of activity and hospital performance explaining the propensity to collaborate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Formation of collaborative networks among hospitals is not hampered by reforms aimed at fostering market forces. Because procompetition reforms elicit peculiar forms of managed competition in universalistic health systems, studies are needed to clarify whether the positive association between interhospital competition and collaboration can be generalized to other health-care settings.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2012.02.011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22406110/,economics

"At 18 months, the Great Recession of December 2007 to June 2009 is the longest recession since World War II. The recession led to soaring unemployment, resulting in loss of employment-based health insurance for millions of people. In addition to seeing increases in uninsured patients, hospitals experienced losses in their investment portfolios, which in turn increased bad debt, charity care, and uncompensated care nationwide. Hospital executives began to devise cost-cutting strategies to balance the rising debt, such as standardizing medical equipment, cutting staff positions, and delaying construction projects and capital expenditures as well as implementing value analysis strategies. The recession is officially over, and, although economic recovery has been slow and unemployment continues to be an issue, hospitals' net revenue started improving as of 2009 and hospital construction started increasing in 2010.

"Background:
        
      
      Healthcare is increasingly influenced by economical constraints which can lead to ethical conflicts for surgeons. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of these conflicts and the coping strategies of surgeons.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, standardized staff survey in an academic pediatric surgical department was performed over a period of 4 weeks. The types of conflict and solution strategies were determined. The agreement with given statements was determined using a 5-point Likert scale.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 155 returned questionnaires 74 ethical conflicts were identified. Most conflicts concerned decisions relating to diagnosis-related groups (DRG) which were economically based. To resolve the ethical conflict surgeons decided to the detriment of patients in 73 % and to the economical benefit in 72 %. In 8 % a medical disadvantage for the patient was noted and in 62 % a disadvantage for patient comfort was seen. Surgeons were highly dissatisfied with the conflict solutions (2.3/5).

"The aim of health economic evaluation is to maximize health gains from limited resources. By definition, health economic evaluation is comparative, based on average costs and outcomes of compared interventions. Incremental costs and outcomes are used to calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio, which represents the average incremental cost per gained unit of effectiveness (i.e.: a year of life) with the evaluated intervention compared to the reference. The health economic rationale applies to all health domains. We cannot spend collective resources (health insurance) without asking ourselves about their potential alternative uses. This reasoning is useful to caregivers for understanding resources allocation decisions and healthcare recommandations.

"Honesty is a fundamental pillar for cooperation in human societies and thus for their economic welfare. However, humans do not always act in an honest way. Here, we examine how insurance coverage affects the degree of honesty in credence goods markets. Such markets are plagued by strong incentives for fraudulent behavior of sellers, resulting in estimated annual costs of billions of dollars to customers and the society as a whole. Prime examples of credence goods are all kinds of repair services, the provision of medical treatments, the sale of software programs, and the provision of taxi rides in unfamiliar cities. We examine in a natural field experiment how computer repair shops take advantage of customers' insurance for repair costs. In a control treatment, the average repair price is about EUR 70, whereas the repair bill increases by more than 80% when the service provider is informed that an insurance would reimburse the bill. Our design allows decomposing the sources of this economically impressive difference, showing that it is mainly due to the overprovision of parts and overcharging of working time. A survey among repair shops shows that the higher bills are mainly ascribed to insured customers being less likely to be concerned about minimizing costs because a third party (the insurer) pays the bill. Overall, our results strongly suggest that insurance coverage greatly increases the extent of dishonesty in important sectors of the economy with potentially huge costs to customers and whole economies.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518015113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27325784/,economics
"Aim:
        
      
      The purpose of the present study is to describe the economic context in Spain and its impact on the health care sector and in nursing schools.
    


          Background:
        
      
      The global economic crisis is affecting nursing in Spain. This study analyses and compares indicators related to health care and nursing schools among European countries. Some new strategies to cope with the challenges arising from the health care crisis are suggested.
    


          Key issues:
        
      
      Health care costs are increasing as a result of the ageing of the Spanish population, immigration, chronicity of health problems and new medical technology. Nursing education has changed in 2010 from a 3-year diploma programme to a 4-year University degree in Nursing. This change requires new resources involving staff, facilities and equipment, all of which are lacking because of the economic crisis in Spain.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The worldwide economic crisis has affected Spain more than it has other European Union (EU) countries. This global crisis has an impact on the health care sector as well on nursing schools.
    


          Implications for nursing management:
        
      
      It is essential for nursing management to develop creative approaches to maintain cost effective patient care. New programmes and technology must be carefully evaluated in terms of cost effectiveness before being implemented. All health care professionals should be well informed and have a solid understanding of this situation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2010.01118.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20636496/,economics
"Pharmacoeconomic assessment of formulary actions has become increasingly common in local, national, and international formulary decision making. Tactics for managing medication use include formulary management and drug policies. Pharmacoeconomic data can provide support for these formulary decisions. For example, pharmacoeconomic data can support the inclusion or exclusion of a drug on or from the formulary and support practice guidelines that promote the most cost-effective or appropriate utilisation of pharmaceutical products. Various strategies can be used to incorporate pharmacoeconomics into formulary decision making. These include using published pharmacoeconomic studies and economic modelling techniques, and conducting local pharmacoeconomic research. Criteria for evaluating the pharmacoeconomic literature, suggestions for employing economic models, and suggested guidelines for conducting pharmacoeconomic projects are discussed. Although most formularies are viewed as cost-containment tools, formularies should not be a list of the 'cheapest' alternatives. Today's formulary should contain agents that optimise therapeutic outcomes while controlling cost. Pharmacoeconomic assessments of formulary decisions help to ensure that the agents promoted by our formularies yield the highest outcome per dollar spent. A discussion of the process for formulary action in a US hospital, the influence of pharmacoeconomics on US formularies, and strategies for incorporating pharmacoeconomics into formulary decision making are presented in this paper.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199600091-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10160112/,economics
"Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both costs and consequences. Economic evaluation can also be called economic appraisal or the cost-benefit approach. The basis of economic evaluation lies in comparing costs and benefits of an intervention, program or service. The most important reasons for undertaking an economic evaluation are that resources (e.g., money, time, staff, equipment) are scarce compared with the demands made on them, and that such resource constraints require choices to be made. In this paper, four types of economic evaluations (cost-minimisation, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses) are described.",https://doi.org/10.1177/183335839902800407,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10387363/,economics
"Importance:
        
      
      Policy makers have proposed levying penalties for drug price increases that are higher than the rate of inflation for drugs covered in the US Medicare program, but research is lacking regarding the ways in which manufacturers might respond to those penalties. An understanding of manufacturers' responses to existing inflation penalties could inform such policy discussions.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the association of existing inflation penalties in the US 340B Drug Pricing Program with manufacturer pricing behavior in the Medicare Part D program and associated changes in Medicare pharmacy expenditures.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This study included a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis of price changes for Medicare Part D drugs used annually by more than 5000 beneficiaries between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017. The percentage of Medicare Part D sales subject to inflation penalties in the 340B program was used to perform a regression analysis to estimate the association of inflation penalties with annual drug price changes. The 340B program requires manufacturers to sell their drugs at a lower price to safety-net health care organizations; this lower price includes a base discount and an additional discount equal to the amount of any price increase that is higher than the rate of inflation. Sales to these 340B-eligible health care organizations represent the market share of a drug subject to inflation penalties. Health care organization-level claims data were obtained from the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data-Part D Prescriber database, and organizations were matched to the Office of Pharmacy Affairs Information System of the Health Resources and Services Administration to identify those organizations that were eligible for the 340B program. Price change and drug use data were obtained from the Medicare Part D Drug Spending Dashboard. Name-brand drugs were included in the analysis if they did not have generic competition and were used by more than 5000 individuals with Medicare Part D in 1 calendar year. Data analysis was conducted from January 1 to February 28, 2020.
    


          Main outcomes and measure:
        
      
      Annual price change was the primary outcome measure; spending changes associated with lower price increases were also estimated. Sales percentage subject to inflation penalties was the primary independent variable, and formulary classification was a control variable.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 2148 brand-name drugs included in the database, 606 drugs were used by more than 5000 beneficiaries annually, with a mean sales percentage subject to inflation penalties of 12.1%. A higher sales percentage subject to inflation penalties was associated with lower annual price increases (between-effects coefficient, -0.114; 95% CI, -0.205 to -0.023; P = .01; fixed-effects coefficient, -0.380; 95% CI, -0.466 to -0.294; P < .001). Lower price increases owing to inflation penalties were estimated to be associated with a reduction in Medicare Part D pharmacy expenditures of $7.1 billion between 2013 and 2017.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this cross-sectional study, increases in the percentage of drug sales subject to inflation penalties were associated with lower annual price increases. Broader application of inflation penalties may help to reduce drug price increases and decrease overall drug spending.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.16388,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32915237/,economics
"This paper examines how major earthquakes affected the returns and volatility of aggregate stock market indices in thirty-five financial markets over the last twenty years. Results show that global financial markets are resilient to shocks caused by earthquakes even if these are domestic. Our analysis reveals that, in a few instances, some macroeconomic variables and earthquake characteristics (gross domestic product per capita, trade openness, bilateral trade flows, earthquake magnitude, a tsunami indicator, distance to the epicenter, and number of fatalities) mediate the impact of earthquakes on stock market returns, resulting in a zero net effect. However, the influence of these variables is market-specific, indicating no systematic pattern across global capital markets. Results also demonstrate that stock market volatility is unaffected by earthquakes, except for Japan.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133319,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26197482/,economics
"Portugal has faced an economic and financial crisis that began circa FY2009 and whose effects are still ongoing. In FY2011, the Portuguese state and the European triumvirate - composed of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank - signed the Memoranda of Understanding. This troika agreement aimed to improve the operational efficiency of public services. This crisis had a considerable impact on the Portuguese citizens' life and productivity, as well as on the public health care system. Cuts over public expenditures have been made to reduce the risk of noncompliance with budgetary targets, despite their potential impact on quality and access to health care services. We analyzed the main policies and measures undertaken by the Portuguese Ministry of Health with respect to the bailout program associated with the troika agreement. Then, we focused on the budgetary cuts-related risks over the social performance of the care system. Evidence suggests that structural reforms in the health care sector in the troika period had positive effects in terms of drugs administration and consumption, on the one hand, and secondary care expenditures reduction, on the other hand. Nonetheless, we observed some divestitures on infrastructures and the worsening of access to health care services.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731418822227,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30678522/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      The costs of investing in health care reform initiatives to improve quality and safety have been underreported and are often underestimated. This paper reports direct and indirect cost estimates for the initial phase of the province-wide implementation of Lean activities in Saskatchewan, Canada.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In order to obtain detailed information about each type of Lean event, as well as the total number of corresponding Lean events, we used the Provincial Kaizen Promotion Office (PKPO) Kaizen database. While the indirect cost of Lean implementation has been estimated using the corresponding wage rate for the event participants, the direct cost has been estimated using the fees paid to the consultant and other relevant expenses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total cost for implementation of Lean over two years (2012-2014), including consultants and new hires, ranged from $44 million CAD to $49.6 million CAD, depending upon the assumptions used. Consultant costs accounted for close to 50% of the total. The estimated cost of Lean events alone ranged from $16 million CAD to $19.5 million CAD, with Rapid Process Improvement Workshops requiring the highest input of resources.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Recognizing the substantial financial and human investments required to undertake reforms designed to improve quality and contain cost, policy makers must carefully consider whether and how these efforts result in the desired transformations. Evaluation of the outcomes of these investments must be part of the accountability framework, even prior to implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-017-2477-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28774301/,economics
"The cost of prescription drugs is imposing an ever greater burden on families and varying levels of government. The vast majority of this cost is attributable to patent protection, since most drugs are actually relatively cheap to produce. The temporary monopolies provided by patent protection have been the main mechanism through which corporations have financed their drug research. This article examines the efficiency of publicly supported drug research relative to the current patent system. The author shows that even if publicly funded research were considerably less efficient on a dollar-per-dollar basis than patent-supported research, there would still be enormous gains from switching to a system of publicly supported research. The main reason for this conclusion is that patent monopolies lead to enormous economic distortions, including expensive sales promotion efforts, research into ""copycat drugs,"" incentives to conceal unfavorable research findings, and other inefficiencies that economic theory predicts would result from a government-created monopoly. The gains from publicly supported research, coupled with a free market in the production of drugs, could reach into several hundred billion dollars annually within a decade.",https://doi.org/10.2190/xn5f-xmra-duqu-36ww,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15346683/,economics
"Chronic diseases present a major challenge to individuals, health professionals, and policy makers. Disease burdens and fears of a lifelong condition are complicated by the volatility of health insurance. Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus face these challenges daily. Treatment needs persist despite changes in individual health insurance or health plan coverage, yet this costly and devastating disease does not discriminate economically. The demands for care are the same for the under- and uninsured as they are for the fully insured. As life expectancy lengthens for individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus, a greater potential exists for significant variability in coverage. This article presents a review and analysis of health insurance issues among adults 18-64 years old and extrapolates the consequences for those in the United States (US) with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

"This study evaluated the economic impact of patient-focused pharmacist intervention in the community retail setting in patients with hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and/or hypercholesterolemia. Specially trained pharmacists intervened by providing targeted patient education, performing systematic patient monitoring, offering feedback and behavior modification, and communicating regularly with patients' physicians to enable early intervention for drug-related problems. We evaluated prescription drug costs and total medical costs by comparing claims data from 188 patients enrolled in the program at three intervention pharmacies with data from 401 control patients at five nonparticipating pharmacies from the same retail chain. For all disease states, the average cost per prescription was significantly higher in the group receiving intervention than in the control group. Differences in total monthly prescription costs were significant only for patients with asthma, with higher monthly costs in the group receiving intervention. Substantial savings were demonstrated across all cost analyses for total monthly medical costs. Savings ranged from a conservative estimate of $143.95 per patient per month to $293.39 per patient per month when accounting for the possible influence of age, comorbid conditions, and disease severity. Our data indicate that pharmacist intervention in this community pharmacy-based disease management model substantially reduced monthly health care costs in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and asthma.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0149-2918(97)80078-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9083713/,economics
"Pharmaceutical expenditure represents a large percentage of total healthcare expenditure, and has thus received much attention within the economic evaluation literature. However, although the number of contingent valuation (CV) studies measuring willingness to pay (WTP) in healthcare has increased, little is known about the relative magnitude of values elicited across different interventions, diseases or countries, or the methodological comparability of these values. We address this gap by seeking to establish if it is feasible to use elicited WTP values in resource allocation, illustrated by attempting to compile a 'league table' of WTP values for pharmaceutical interventions. A review database was compiled for CV studies in healthcare published from January 1985 to December 2005. Of 210 studies identified, 40 considered pharmaceutical interventions. Values are presented as mean or median WTP values, adjusted where necessary to pound and $US for 2004/5. Lack of reporting in some instances of either the mean or median, together with heterogenous methods and infrequent reporting of costs, made 'league table' construction difficult. This raises questions about the use of existing studies for resource allocation decisions, despite the fact that most studies were seemingly undertaken for policy objectives. However, four interventions had more than one study, making it possible to compare the values elicited. The values elicited across studies were fairly consistent for two interventions (anti-hypertensive therapy and tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha blockade for rheumatoid arthritis), whereas WTP values for insulin and post-operative emesis therapy were very divergent. No single methodological difference seemed to explain this pattern; however, the more methodological differences between studies the greater the likelihood of divergent values. A checklist, or minimum reporting set of information, is the first step towards improving the consistency of methods, and therefore values, published. In the longer term, a move towards the use of a reference case akin to that used for cost-utility studies would seem important if such studies are to be used for comparative purposes and thereby be relevant to resource allocation decision making.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200725020-00004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17249854/,economics

"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm arrhythmia, which has considerable economic consequences. This study aims to identify the current cost-of-illness estimates of AF; a focus was put on describing the studies' methodology. A literature review was conducted. Twenty-eight cost-of-illness studies were identified. Cost-of-illness estimates exist for health insurance members, hospital and primary care populations. In addition, the cost of stroke in AF patients and the costs of post-operative AF were calculated. The methods used were heterogeneous, mostly studies calculated excess costs. The identified annual excess costs varied, even among studies from the USA (∼US$1900 to ∼US$19,000). While pointing toward considerable costs, the cost-of-illness studies' relevance could be improved by focusing on subpopulations and treatment mixes. As possible starting points for subsequent economic studies, the methodology of cost-of-illness studies should be taken into account using methods, allowing stakeholders to find suitable studies and validate estimates.",https://doi.org/10.1586/14737167.2014.940904,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25047664/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Many countries lack fully functional pharmacovigilance programs, and public budgets allocated to pharmacovigilance in industrialized countries remain low due to resource constraints and competing priorities.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Using 3 case examples, we sought to estimate the public health and economic benefits resulting from public investment in active pharmacovigilance programs to detect adverse drug effects.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      We assessed 3 examples in which early signals of safety hazards were not adequately recognized, resulting in continued exposure of a large number of patients to these drugs when safer and effective alternative treatments were available. The drug examples studied were rofecoxib, cerivastatin, and troglitazone. Using an individual patient simulation model and the health care system perspective, we estimated the potential costs that could have been averted by early systematic detection of safety hazards through the implementation of active surveillance programs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that earlier drug withdrawal made possible by active safety surveillance would most likely have resulted in savings in direct medical costs of $773-$884 million for rofecoxib, $3-$10 million for cerivastatin, and $38-$63 million for troglitazone in the United States through the prevention of adverse events. By contrast, the yearly public investment in Food and Drug Administration initiated population-based pharmacovigilance activities in the United States is about $42.5 million at present.

"In Canada, there are two separate review processes for the public reimbursement of drugs: one for cancer drugs (originally called the Joint Oncology Drug Review [JODR] and now called the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review [pCODR]) and one for drugs in all other disease areas (called the Common Drug Review). We explore whether a justification that is derived from an economic perspective has been provided, in Canada or elsewhere, for cancer drugs to have a separate reimbursement review process (i.e. to be 'treated separately') relative to drugs in all other disease areas. Literature reviews and internet searches were undertaken to identify, collect and analyze relevant documents that would provide information regarding whether an economic rationale has been provided for cancer drugs to be treated separately for resource allocation purposes. Although a number of reasons for cancer drugs to be treated separately were cited both by the JODR and pCODR and in the peer-reviewed literature, a rationale derived from an economic perspective did not appear to be documented. From an economic perspective, separating cancer drugs for resource allocation purposes is likely to impede drug plan decision makers' ability to allocate resources in a manner that maximizes the total aggregate health benefit for the population from available resources. While we acknowledge the challenges that cancer drugs pose to drug reimbursement decision makers, we suggest that separating the reimbursement review of cancer drugs requires further scrutiny.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0238-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424496/,economics

"One of the key issues in implementing prospective Medicare fee schedules is how to set prices that accurately reflect competitive market forces. Competitive bidding has long been used in government procurement efforts for nonhealth services. In this paper, we evaluate how provider behavior will be affected if Medicare uses competitive bidding to set Medicare fee schedules. Our model provides several important insights about competitive bidding for health care services. First, the model shows that competitive bidding will lead to 2-stage competition between providers. In the bidding stage, providers will compete to submit winning bids. In the following stage, winning providers will compete for business through marketing efforts that may enhance quality. Second, the model shows how the design of the bidding mechanism affects bidding strategies and the importance of individual provisions within the design, such as penalties for losing bidders. Third, the model demonstrates how competitive bidding will affect quality. It shows how quality may deteriorate if the bidding mechanism chooses an exclusive winner and why naming multiple winners can keep quality at acceptable levels. Finally, we identify criteria for determining whether a particular type of Medicare service is well-suited for competitive bidding.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-199310000-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8412391/,economics
"This paper investigates why economic approaches to priority setting have had only limited impact in practice. It argues that obstacles to the take-up of the economic approach centre on (1) limitations in the theory and practice of economic evaluations, and (2) the nature of the wider context within which decisions on priority setting take place. On the first point, it argues that, despite advances in research methods, there is still debate about the theoretical basis of measures typically used in economic evaluations, such as QALYs, and that much of the extant empirical data is of questionable quality. On the second point, it maintains that politicians, health care professionals and local people attach importance to other factors besides allocative efficiency. If economic approaches are to have more impact in the future, it argues that health economists need to adopt a wider research agenda, focusing on public sector decision-making and, in particular, the incentives and constraints governing the use of economic data in different types of health care organisation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(99)00040-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10827288/,economics
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects over 30 million people in the United States of America. Given the large and growing prevalence of AD, the associated economic burden is significant. It has been estimated that AD costs over $5 billion dollars annually.

Indirect costs include missed days or lost productivity at work or school, career modification, and reduced quality of life. Understanding and measuring these costs can be accomplished through rigorous economic evaluation, which is the organized process of considering inputs and outcomes of various activities. Economic evaluation has been used to contextualize the burden of AD in society. It has also been used to inform patients, providers, and other stakeholders on how to deliver the most evidence-based, efficient care possible.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To estimate the average return on investment for the overall activities of county departments of public health in California.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      I gathered the elements necessary to estimate the average return on investment for county departments of public health in California during the period 2001 to 2008-2009. These came from peer-reviewed journal articles published as part of a larger project to develop a method for determining return on investment for public health by using a health economics framework. I combined these elements by using the standard formula for computing return on investment, and performed a sensitivity analysis. Then I compared the return on investment for county departments of public health with the returns on investment generated for various aspects of medical care.

"Background:
        
      
      Health economic evaluations are essential to support health care policy and investment decisions. To date, health economic evaluations in orthotics and prosthetics have focused on discrete components of an orthosis/prosthesis (e.g. a microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee joint) rather than the broader service provided by orthotist/prosthetists. As such, the contribution to orthotic/prosthetic policy and investment decisions is unclear. Whilst there are opportunities to conduct more informative health economic evaluations that describe the costs and benefits of the orthotic/prosthetic service, it is important that prospective research is informed by a critical review of the method design challenges and an understanding of how this research can be improved. The aim of this systematic review is to critically appraise the existing orthotic/prosthetic health economic evaluation literature and therefore determine evidence gaps, critical method design issues and the extent to which the literature informs orthotic/prosthetic policy and investment decisions.

      A comprehensive range of databases-AMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsychINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and specialty health economic databases-will be searched using National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms as well as the title, abstract, and keyword terms. Search terms related to the intervention (e.g. orthosis), including variants used by varying professional disciplines (e.g. brace), will be used in preference to defining the populations that use orthotic and prosthetic services (e.g. people living with rheumatoid arthritis). Search terms related to health economic evaluations will be guided by previously developed and tested search strings and align with recommendations by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be hand-searched for relevant citations, and a forward citation search using Google Scholar will also be conducted to identify early online articles not yet indexed in traditional databases. Original research published in the English language and after 1 January 2000 will be included. The Checklist for Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) and the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC)-Extended list will be used to appraise the methodological quality and identify sources of bias. Data extraction and appraisal will be conducted by one reviewer independently using appraisal instrument guidelines and a content specific decision aid with exemplars. A subsequent review by a second researcher will be undertaken to confirm the accuracy of the extraction and appraisal, and a final review by a third where consensus cannot be reached. The data will be extracted to a purpose-built data extraction template with decision-making guidelines to support consistency. Where possible, the findings of the review will be reported as a meta-analysis, although the heterogeneity of the literature will likely mean a narrative review that illuminates method design issues that contribute to imprecision and variation will be more appropriate.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This protocol has been purposefully designed to summarise the existing evidence and appraise the methodological approaches used and the quality of the health economic evaluations in orthotics and prosthetics. What we learn from this review will be used to guide further work in this area and design more rigorous health economic evaluations into the future.

"Although overweight and obesity have long been recognised as major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, lifestyle developments have led to substantial increases in bodyweight worldwide. In addition to their negative effects on health and quality of life, obesity and associated comorbidities may have a considerable impact on healthcare expenditures. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise cost estimates and compare costs attributable to obesity across different European countries. A structured search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and all EBM Reviews was conducted to identify relevant literature. Two researchers independently assessed publications according to pre-defined inclusion criteria and with regard to study methodology. Costs attributable to obesity were extracted from the included studies and calculated relative to country-specific gross domestic income. Out of 797 publications that met our search criteria, 13 studies investigating 10 Western European countries were determined to be relevant and included in our review. Obesity-related healthcare burdens of up to 10.4 billion euros were found. Reported relative economic burdens ranged from 0.09% to 0.61% of each country's gross domestic product (GDP). Obesity appears to be responsible for a substantial economic burden in many European countries, and the costs identified in the available studies presumably reflect conservative estimates. There remains a great need for prospective and standardised studies to provide more accurate estimates of costs for all European countries.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-008-9239-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18509729/,economics
"The paper examines the influence of health savings accounts (HSAs) on optimal savings, insurance demand and prevention effort over the course of a lifetime. This paper adds to the literature by investigating HSAs as both a form of insurance and as saving vehicle in an expected utility framework. Assuming no regulatory constraints on the deductible, we show that individuals voluntarily choose a positive deductible and increase their savings with HSAs. If the government-imposed minimum deductible becomes too great, however, individuals may instead choose to remain in traditional insurance. We determine the effect of HSAs on prevention effort. We find that an increased tax subsidy may worsen moral hazard issues. Assuming partial risk aversion to be less than or equal to one, individuals will either invest less in the health preservation effort and more money in the HSA or vice versa. However, they will never increase both effort and savings simultaneously as was intended when HSAs were introduced.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2010.12.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21349595/,economics
"Efficient prescribing is a controversial concept when defined in economic terms. Such terms imply that neither the best nor the cheapest drug may be efficient. Efficiency depends on patient evaluations of outcomes--an essential, yet still underdeveloped, field of inquiry. Encouraging prescribing efficiency (once it is clear what efficient treatments are) may require the use of incentives, (economic and otherwise). Although physicians do react to economic incentives, encouraging them to also act as good economists rather than only as good healthcare providers may be difficult since economic efficiency goals may conflict with pure medical goals. While it is conceptually reasonable to assume that economic incentives will accomplish behavioural change, other (noneconomic) incentive mechanisms may appear less controversial. Since it is the result, not the process, that is important, a mix of incentives to achieve efficient solutions is suggested. However, further investigation into both health and economic outcomes research and debate on proper efficiency goals should precede the discussion of optimal incentives.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199406030-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10155265/,economics
"Rationale, aims, and objectives:
        
      
      In recent years, several expensive new health technologies have been introduced. The availability of those technologies intensifies the discussion regarding the affordability of these technologies at different decision-making levels. On the meso level, both hospitals and clinicians are facing budget constraints resulting in a tension to balance between different patients' interests. As such, it is crucial to make optimal use of the available resources. Different strategies are in place to deal with this problem, but decisions on a macro level on what to fund or not can limit the role and freedom of clinicians in their decisions on a micro level. At the same time, without central guidance regarding such decisions, micro level decisions may lead to inequities and undesirable treatment variation between clinicians and hospitals. The challenge is to find instruments that can balance both levels of decision making.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that their decisions to spend more resources (like time and budget) on 1 particular patient group reduce the resources available to other patients. Involving clinicians in thinking about the optimal use of limited resources, also in an attempt to bridge the world of economic reasoning and clinical practice, is crucial therefore. We argue that clinical guidelines may prove a clear vehicle for this by including both clinical and economic evidence to support the recommendations made. The development of such guidelines requires cooperation of clinicians, and health economists are cooperating with each other.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The development of clinical guidelines which combine economic and clinical evidence should be stimulated, to balance central guidance and uniformity while maintaining necessary decentralized freedom. This is an opportunity to combine the reality of budgets and opportunity costs with clinical practice. Missing this opportunity risks either variation and inequity or central and necessarily crude measures.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.12936,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29700903/,economics

"This paper addresses the problem of how to value health care programmes with different ratios of costs to effects, specifically when taking into account that these costs and effects are uncertain. First, the traditional framework of maximising health effects with a given health care budget is extended to a flexible budget using a value function over money and health effects. Second, uncertainty surrounding costs and effects is included in the model using expected utility. Other approaches to uncertainty that do not specify a utility function are discussed and it is argued that these also include implicit notions about risk attitude.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.973,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15678518/,economics
"In this article, we will undertake a long-term analysis of the evolution of the Swedish welfare state, seeking to explain that evolution through the use of a systemic approach. That is, our approach will consider the interrelations between economic growth (EG), the sociopolitical institutional framework (IF), and the welfare state (WS)-understood as a set of institutions embracing the labor market and its regulation, the tax system, and the so-called social wage-in order to find the main variables that elucidate its evolution. We will show that the expansive phase of the Swedish welfare state can be explained by the symbiotic relationships developed in the WS-EG-IF interaction, whereas the period of welfare state retrenchment is one result of changes operating within the sociopolitical IF and EG bases.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731414568506,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25813499/,economics

"Given the expected increase in the number of people with dementia in the coming years, it is anticipated that the resources necessary to support those with dementia will significantly increase. There will therefore likely be increased emphasis on how best to use limited resources across a number of domains including prevention, diagnosis, treatment and supporting informal caregivers. There has been increasing use of economic methods in dementia in the past number of years, in particular, cost-of-illness analysis and economic evaluation.

"We explain the establishment of Covered California, California's health insurance marketplace. The marketplace uses an active purchaser model, which means that Covered California can selectively contract with some health plans and exclude others. During the 2014 open-enrollment period, it enrolled 1.3 million people, who are covered by eleven health plans. We describe the market shares of health plans in California and in each of the nineteen rating regions. We examine the empirical relationship between measures of provider market concentration--spanning health plans, hospitals, and medical groups--and rating region premiums. To do this, we analyze premiums for silver and bronze plans for specific age groups. We find both medical group concentration and hospital concentration to be positively associated with premiums, while health plan concentration is not statistically significant. We simulate the impact of reducing hospital concentration to levels that would exist in moderately competitive markets. This produces a predicted overall premium reduction of more than 2 percent. However, in three of the nineteen rating regions, the predicted premium reduction was more than 10 percent. These results suggest the importance of provider market concentration on premiums.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-3424474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26447023/,economics
"In many countries regulated competition among health insurance companies has recently been proposed or implemented. A crucial issue is whether or not the benefits package offered by competing insurers should also cover catastrophic risks (like several forms of expensive long-term care) in addition to non-catastrophic risks (like hospital care and physician services). In 1988 the Dutch government proposed compulsory national health insurance based on regulated competition among insurer as well as among providers of care. The competing insurers should offer a benefits package covering both non-catastrophic risks and catastrophic risks. The insurers would be largely financed via risk-adjusted capitation payments. The government intended to use a capitation formula that is, besides some demographic variables, based on multi-year prior costs. This paper presents the results of an explorative empirical analysis of the possible consequences of such a capitation formula for catastrophic risks. The main conclusion is that this formula would be inadequate because it would leave ample room for cream skimming.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(96)00862-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10165042/,economics

"The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry from the perspective of medical economics, by comparing a part-time and full-time psychiatric department. One full-time (5 days per week) psychiatrist began work at a general hospital (GH-A), and one part-time (once per week) psychiatrist had been working at another general hospital (GH-B). Both general hospitals are teaching hospitals of the same size. The number of patients and the medical reimbursements were investigated each month and compared. This study demonstrated that the establishment of C-L psychiatry was economically profitable in contrast with what was the common belief among general hospital administrators. Also, the differences in the total number of patients (GH-A: GH-B = 500:35-50 patients/month) and the total reimbursement (GH-A: GH-B = 3 million: 2-300000 yen/month) was not explained by the number of working days (GH-A: GH-B = 5:1 day/week). The full-time model of C-L psychiatry has also indirect effects (i.e. educational and relieving effects) on the hospital staff. Promoting the establishment of C-L psychiatry requires many evidence-based studies that demonstrate the necessity for C-L psychiatry and can directly persuade hospital directors.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1819.1999.00583.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10498225/,economics
"This paper assesses recent health sector reform strategies across Europe adopted since the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. It begins with a brief overview of the continued economic pressure on public funding for health care services, particularly in tax-funded Northern European health care systems. While economic growth rates across Europe have risen a bit in the last year, they remain below the level necessary to provide the needed expansion of public health sector revenues. This continued public revenue shortage has become the central challenge that policymakers in these health systems confront, and increasingly constrains their potential range of policy options. The paper then examines the types of targeted reforms that various European governments have introduced in response to this increased fiscal stringency. Particularly in tax-funded health systems, these efforts have been focused on two types of changes on the production side of their health systems: consolidating and/or centralizing administrative authority over public hospitals, and revamping secondary and primary health services as well as social services to reduce the volume, cost and less-than-optimal outcomes of existing public elderly care programs. While revamping elderly care services also was pursued in the social health insurance (SHI) system in the Netherlands, both the Dutch and the German health systems also made important changes on the financing side of their health systems. Both types of targeted reforms are illustrated through short country case studies. Each of these country assessments flags up new mechanisms that have been introduced and which potentially could be reshaped and applied in other national health sector contexts. Reflecting the tax-funded structure of the Canadian health system, the preponderance of cases discussed focus on tax-funded countries (Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, England, Ireland), with additional brief assessments of recent changes in the SHI-funded health systems in the Netherlands and Germany. The paper concludes that post-2008 European reforms have helped stretch existing public funds more effectively, but seem unlikely to resolve the core problem of inadequate overall public funding, particularly in tax-based health systems. This observation suggests that ongoing Canadian efforts to consolidate and better integrate its health care providers, while important, may not eliminate long-term health sector-funding dilemmas.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133117000445,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29362008/,economics
"Several recent studies have estimated the responsiveness of mortality to English National Health Service spending. Although broadly similar, the studies differ in how they identify the outcome equation. One approach uses conventional socio-economic variables as instruments for endogenous health care expenditure, whereas the other exploits exogenous elements in the resource allocation formula for local budgets. The former approach has usually been applied to specific disease areas (e.g., for cancer and circulatory disease), whereas the other has only been applied to all-cause mortality. In this letter, we compare the two approaches by using them to estimate the direct all-cause elasticity as well as disease-specific elasticities. We also calculate the implied all-cause elasticity associated with the disease-specific results. We find that the ""funding rule"" approach to identification can be successfully replicated and applied to disease area models. This is important because disease area models reduce the danger of aggregation bias present in all-cause analysis, and they offer the opportunity to link estimated mortality effects to more complete measures of health outcome that reflect what is currently known about the survival and morbidity disease burden in different programmes.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3650,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29607571/,economics

"Competitive social health insurance systems (at least) in Western Europe have implemented systems of morbidity based risk adjustment to set a level playing field for insurers. However, many high cost insured still are heavily underfunded despite risk adjustment, leaving incentives for risk selection. In most of these health care systems, there is an ongoing debate about how to deal with such underpaid high cost cases. This study develops four distinct concepts by adding variables to risk adjustment or by setting up a high cost pool for underpaid insured besides the risk adjustment system. Their features, incentives and distributional effects are discussed. With a data set of 6 million insured, performance is demonstrated for Germany. All models achieve a substantial improvement in model fit, measured in terms of R(2) as well as CPM. As the results of the various models are different in different dimensions, the trade-offs that have to be dealt with and should be addressed, when implementing a model to reduce underfunding of high cost cases.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.01.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26806676/,economics

Application of these principles to appropriate antimicrobial treatment requires separate consideration of a sequence of questions: Who needs treatment?

None of these questions is easy to answer, but economic analysis will help the decision maker by making explicit the costs and consequences of the available alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0732-8893(95)00075-l,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7587044/,economics
"The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) employs fixed cost-effectiveness (CE) thresholds that guide their appraisal of an intervention's long-term economic value. Given ICER's rising influence in the healthcare field, we undertook an assessment of the concordance of ICER's CE findings to the published CE findings from other research groups (i.e., ""non-ICER"" researchers including life science manufacturers, academics, and government institutions). Disease areas and pharmaceutical interventions for comparison were determined based on ICER evaluations conducted from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. A targeted literature search was conducted for non-ICER CE publications using PubMed. Studies had to be conducted from the US setting, include the same disease characteristics (e.g., disease severity; treatment history), incorporate the same pharmaceutical interventions and comparison groups, and present incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the healthcare sector or payer perspective. Discordance was measured as the proportion of unique interventions that would have had more favorable valuations (i.e., low, intermediate, high value-for-money) if the CE findings from other research groups had been used for decision making instead of ICER's findings. More favorable valuations were defined as transitioning from low value (as determined by ICER) to intermediate or high value (as determined by other researchers) and from intermediate value (as determined by ICER) to high value (as determined by other researchers). Among the 13 non-ICER studies meeting inclusion criteria, six disease areas and 14 interventions were assessed. Of the 14 interventions, a more favorable valuation would have been recommended for ten therapies if the CE ratios from other research groups had been used for decision making instead of ICER's findings, representing a 71.4% (10/14) discordance rate. Moreover, these discrepancies were found in each of the evaluated disease areas, with the largest number of discordant valuations found in rheumatoid arthritis (five out of six interventions were discordant) followed by one valuation each in multiple sclerosis (one out of three), non-small cell lung cancer (one out of two), multiple myeloma (one out of one), high cholesterol (one out of one), and congestive heart failure (one out of one). Our findings indicate high discordance when comparing ICER's appraisals to the CE findings of non-ICER researchers. To understand the value of new interventions, the totality of evidence on the CE of an intervention-including results from ICER and non-ICER modeling efforts-should be considered when making coverage and reimbursement decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-019-00545-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919779/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Given limited resources compared to the demand for them, spending resources efficiently is important. Key methods applied for supporting efficient resource allocation are health economic evaluations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on secondary literature, we analyze international challenges for using two types of economic evaluations-cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis-in reimbursement decisions and reflect on them for the Austrian case.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The main challenges with the application of economic evaluations are related to the methods, the decision-making culture, and the respective system. The challenges also apply to the Austrian Bismarck system, where almost no formal requirements for using economic evaluations exist, except on a case-by-case basis. Resource allocation in Austria hence occurs, for the most part, implicitly.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      One way forward towards more explicit efficiency considerations may be to consider more descriptive study types and foster capacity building, standardization of methods and presentation of results, and a mandatory detailed guideline.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10354-019-0689-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30868427/,economics
"The rate of increase in health care expenditures has been a central policy concern for well over a decade, yet little empirical research has been conducted to examine expenditure growth rates. This study analyzed health insurance premium growth rates for a selected sample of 95 insured groups over the period 1985 to 1992. During this time, premiums increased by approximately 150% in nominal terms and by 45% in real terms. The observed rate of growth was not constant over time, however. The most rapid growth occurred during the years 1986 to 1989; thereafter, the rate of increase in premiums declined. Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the effects on premium growth rates of selected variables representing insurance benefit design features, market competitive factors, insurance system factors, and group-specific factors. In addition to the percentage increase in benefit payments, other factors found to affect premium growth rates were health maintenance organization market penetration, deductible level, the coinsurance rate, and state insurance mandates. Further, this analysis suggests that the insurance underwriting cycle may play an important role in influencing insurance premium growth rates. These results support the belief that health maintenance organization induced competition has potential to control the rate of increase in health care costs.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005650-199510000-00005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7475402/,economics
"Myanmar's health sector has received low levels of public spending since 1975. Combined with the country's historic political and economic isolation, poor economic management and multiple internal armed conflicts, these limited resources have translated into low coverage of even the most basic services and into poor health outcomes with wide disparities. They have also resulted in out-of-pocket payments for health as a proportion of total health spending being among the highest in the world. The Government of Myanmar has now affirmed its commitment to moving toward Universal Health Coverage. This commitment is reflected in the National Health Plan 2017-2021. Drawing upon analysis of data from the Myanmar Poverty and Living Conditions Survey 2015 and using the country's revised methodology to estimate poverty, this paper explores some of the consequences of Myanmar's excessive reliance on out-of-pocket funding as the main source of health financing. Around 481 000 households in Myanmar experienced catastrophic health spending in 2015. Of this group, 185 000 households lived below the national poverty line. Households that experienced catastrophic health spending spent, on average, 54.7% of their total capacity to pay on health. Of all Myanmar households that went to a health facility in 2015, ∼28% took loans and ∼13% sold their assets to cover health spending. In that same year, ∼1.7 million people fell below the national poverty line due to health spending. The paper then discusses how ongoing reforms could help alleviate the financial hardship associated with care-seeking. With current political will to reform the health system, a conducive macro-economic environment, and the relatively limited vested interests, Myanmar has a window of opportunity to achieve significant progress towards UHC. Continued high-level political support and strong leadership will be needed to keep reforms on track.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czy110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31644797/,economics

Direct cost-benefit analysis is proposed as an alternative. Based on the recently proposed ""life quality index"" (LQI), a rational acceptance criterion and so-called life saving cost are derived. The classical life quality index is reviewed, modified, and imbedded in modern economics theory. The results are then applied to technical facilities. The relation between optimization and the LQI-based acceptance criterion is discussed. The relevant economics literature is reviewed with respect to discount rates applicable for long-term investments into risk reduction. They should be as low as possible according to a recent mathematical result. Modern economic growth theory decomposes the output growth rate into the rate of time preference of consumption and the rate of economical growth multiplied by the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption. It is found that the rate of time preference of consumption should be a little larger than the long-term population growth rate. The public benefit rate (output growth rate) on the other hand should be smaller than the sum of the population growth rate and the long-term growth rate of a national economy, which is around 2% for most industrial countries. Accordingly, the rate of time preference of consumption is about 1%, which is also intergenerationally acceptable from an ethical point of view. Given a certain output growth rate there is a corresponding maximum financial interest rate in order to maintain nonnegativity of the objective function at the optimum. Finally, a simple demonstration example is added.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00467.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15209938/,economics
"Context:
        
      
      Managed care has the potential to transform fundamentally the structure and functioning of the entire health care system, including the care provided to patients who are not enrolled in managed care plans.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether increasing health maintenance organization (HMO) market share is associated with decreased expenditures for the care of patients covered by Medicare's traditional fee-for-service plan, a group cared for well outside the boundaries of managed care.
    


          Design and setting:
        
      
      Data from the Health Care Financing Administration were used to compare expenditures for the care of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for 802 market areas, representing the entire United States, for 1990 to 1994. These data were matched with data on system-wide (Medicare and non-Medicare) HMO market share in these areas.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      All fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries (1990-1994) except for those with end-stage renal disease.
    


          Main outcome measure:
        
      
      Average fee-for-service expenditure per fee-for-service Medicare beneficiary by market area.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In a regression model, increases in system-wide HMO market share were associated with declines in both Part A and Part B fee-for-service expenditures per Medicare beneficiary (P<.001). Increases from 10% market share to 20% market share were associated with 2.0% decreases in Part A fee-for-service expenditures and 1.5% decreases in Part B fee-for-service expenditures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Managed care can have widespread effects on the health care system. Health care for individuals who are not covered by managed care organizations can be influenced by the presence of managed care. Lower expenditures in areas with high HMO market shares may indicate that traditional Medicare beneficiaries in areas with high market shares received fewer or less intensive services than traditional Medicare beneficiaries in other areas.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.281.5.432,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9952203/,economics
"Federal subsidies for health insurance premiums sold through the Marketplaces are tied to the cost of the benchmark plan, the second-lowest-cost silver plan. According to economic theory, the presence of more competitors should lead to lower premiums, implying smaller federal outlays for premium subsidies. The long-term impact of the Affordable Care Act on government spending will depend on the cost of these premium subsidies over time, with insurer participation and the level of competition likely to influence those costs. We studied insurer participation and premiums during the first two years of the Marketplaces. We found that the addition of a single insurer in a county was associated with a 1.2 percent lower premium for the average silver plan and a 3.5 percent lower premium for the benchmark plan in the federally run Marketplaces. We found that the effect of insurer entry was muted after two or three additional entrants. These findings suggest that increased insurer participation in the federally run Marketplaces reduces federal payments for premium subsidies.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0548,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26643622/,economics
"A cost-benefit analysis of smoking, using an attributable risk approach, has been carried out for Canada and for three regions within Canada. The total cost of the consequences of tobacco use--in terms of extra deaths, disability, hospitalization, physician services, and fire losses due to tobacco use--in all cases exceeded the total consumer expenditure for tobacco products. The excess was estimated to have a range from $14 to $127 (1983 Canadian dollars) per person per year. This represents the amount that an individual in society would gain, on average, if tobacco use was eliminated from the society for one year. Tobacco use was also found to be responsible for 12 to 17 per cent of all adult deaths, 4 to 5 per cent of all adult disability days, 12 to 14 per cent of all days of hospitalization, and 2 to 3 per cent of all physician visits.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.4740030306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10312934/,economics
"The introduction of an internal market in the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom necessitated the use of contracts between purchasers and providers. Little thought was given to the nature of these contracts by policy makers, who appeared to assume that the contracts could conform to the classical, complete model. This paper uses socio-legal and economic theories of contract (which provide an alternative model of relational contracts, in contrast to classical contracts) to explore how realistic that assumption was. An analysis of the institutional context in which the contracts were made is provided, including a legal analysis of the relevant legislation. Contracting by health authorities and GP fundholders is examined, using the results of a recent case study of contracting for district nursing services carried out in a health authority in Greater London. The results show that classical contracting is an inappropriate model for NHS contracts, but that relational contracting is not an entirely appropriate model either. Contracting was found to have increased the accountability of providers in respect of some financial matters, but not in respect of the quality of district nursing services. There are negative implications for the use of contracting in publicly financed health services--hierarchies may be more efficient (as lower transaction costs can be incurred) and possibly more effective in improving quality of care.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00025-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11824930/,economics
"Information on the costs and benefits of eHealth interventions is needed, not only to document value for money and to support decision making in the field, but also to form the basis for developing business models and to facilitate payment systems to support large-scale services. In the absence of solid evidence of its effects, key decision makers may doubt the effectiveness, which, in turn, limits investment in, and the long-term integration of, eHealth services. However, it is not realistic to conduct economic evaluations of all eHealth applications and services in all situations, so we need to be able to generalize from those we do conduct. This implies that we have to select the most appropriate methodology and data collection strategy in order to increase the transferability across evaluations. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of how to apply economic evaluation methodology in the eHealth field. It provides a brief overview of basic health economics principles and frameworks and discusses some methodological issues and challenges in conducting cost-effectiveness analysis of eHealth interventions. Issues regarding the identification, measurement, and valuation of costs and benefits are outlined. Furthermore, this work describes the established techniques of combining costs and benefits, presents the decision rules for identifying the preferred option, and outlines approaches to data collection strategies. Issues related to transferability and complexity are also discussed.",https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.4521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552360/,economics

"During the course of the past ten years, the World Bank has become the single largest external financier of health activities in low and middle income countries and an important voice in national and international debates on health policy. This article highlights the Bank's new strategic direction in the health sector aimed at: improving health, nutrition, and population outcomes of the poor; enhancing the performance of health care systems; and securing sustainable health care financing. Millions of preventable deaths and treatable illnesses, together with health systems that are inefficient, inequitable and ineffective, have motivated expanded Bank support for the health sector in many of its client countries. The new policy directions and system-wide reforms observed in these countries are the result of both demand and supply factors. It is part of a general shift in the Bank's approach to development assistance, which sees systemic reform as a way to improve the impact and sustainability of investments in health. On the demand side, the Bank is trying to adapt to ongoing political, technological, economic, demographic, epidemiological and social pressures. On the supply side, the Bank's growing international experience and substantial financial resources are used to complement the development assistance provided by other organizations and the global effort to improve health and health systems in low and middle income countries.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00258-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10619685/,economics

"National and global health policies are increasingly recognizing the key role of the environment in human health development, which is related to its economic and social determinants, such as income level, technical progress, education, quality of jobs, inequality, education or lifestyle. Research has shown that the increase of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita can provide additional funds for health but also for environmental protection. However, often, economic growth is associated with the accelerated degradation of the environment, and this in turn will result in an exponential increase in harmful emissions and will implicitly determine the increasing occurrence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory diseases. In this paper, we investigate the role and effects of economic growth, environmental pollution and non-communicable diseases on health expenditures, for the case of EU (European Union) countries during 2000-2014. In order to investigate the long-term and the short-term relationship between them, we have employed the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method. Using the Pedroni-Johansen cointegration methods, we found that the variables are cointegrated. The findings of this study show that economic growth is one of the most important factors influencing the health expenditures both in the long- and short-run in all the 28 EU countries. With regards to the influence of CO2 emissions on health expenditure, we have found a negative impact in the short-run and a positive impact on the long-run. We have also introduced an interaction between NCDs and environmental expenditure as independent variable, a product variable. Finally, we have found that in all the three estimated models, the variation in environmental expenditure produces changes in NCDs' effect on health expenditure.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16245115,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31847367/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      This article models the cost-effectiveness, from a societal viewpoint, of a dental caries prevention program using salt fluoridation for children 12 years of age, compared with non-intervention (or status quo) in Arequipa, Peru.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods were used. The costs associated with implementing and operating the salt-fluoridation program were identified and measured using 2009 prices. Health outcomes were measured as dental caries averted over a 6-year period. Clinical effectiveness data was taken from published data. Costs were measured as direct treatment costs, programs costs and costs of productivity losses as a result of dental treatments. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. A hypothetical population of 25,000 12-year-olds living in Arequipa, Peru was used in this analysis. Two-way sensitivity analyses were conducted over a range of values for key parameters.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our primary analysis estimated that if a dental caries prevention program using salt-fluoridation was available for 25,000 6-year-old children for 6 years, the net saving from a societal perspective would total S/. 11.95 [1 US$ = S/. (2009) 3.01] per diseased tooth averted when compared with the status quo group. That is, after 6 years, an investment of S/.0.32 per annum per child would result in a net saving of S/.11.95 per decayed/missing/filled teeth prevented.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While the analysis has inherent limitations as a result of its reliance on a range of assumptions, the findings indicate that for the situations prevailing in Peru, there are significant health and economic benefits to be gained from the use of salt fluoridation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-7325.2010.00209.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21774135/,economics

"In classic market theory, increased concentration among providers leads to higher prices for consumers. In the world of contemporary health policy, many stakeholders echo the classic market theory, blaming high health care prices on the increased concentration of providers, such as occurs when hospitals merge or are acquired by other hospitals. Thus, the consolidation of providers has become a convenient target for policy makers who want to be viewed as actively pursuing solutions to the growth in health care spending. Yet many of the factors fueling increased provider concentration are widely believed to be desirable, or practically unavoidable. Meanwhile, health care prices are increasing at historically low levels. Thus, there appears to be a contradiction between efforts to contain health care prices and the fact that aggressive policies aimed at reducing provider concentration might be ineffective and could even have the unintended effect of stunting positive developments. In a group of Health Affairs articles, William Sage and Paul Ginsburg and Gregory Pawlson respond to this conundrum by proposing a range of policy alternatives that, in this author's opinion, are either impractical or counterproductive because they have their roots in classical economic models of an industry with pervasive market failure. More effective and practical responses may be less theoretically elegant but more realistic and more reasonable.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0336,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24841885/,economics
"We sought to compare expected and observed biosimilar and generic entry dates among new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2000 and 2012. We defined expected biosimilar and generic entry dates as the later of the expiration of the key patent term or statutory exclusivity (12 years for biologics, 5 years for small molecule drugs not indicated for a rare disease, and 7 years for small molecule drugs indicated for a rare disease; plus 6 months if a pediatric extension had been granted). For drugs with expected entry prior to 2019, we calculated the proportion with observed biosimilar or generic entry. The expected biosimilar entry dates were estimated to be a median of 12.3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 12.0-14.0, n = 60) after FDA approval. The 12-year biologic statutory exclusivity period comprised 98% of the median expected protection period. By contrast, expected generic entry was estimated to be a median of 12.2 years (IQR 8.4-14.0, n=268), or 7.2 years after the 5-year small molecule statutory exclusivity (59% of the total expected market protection period). By 2019, observed biosimilar entry occurred in 12% of cases (3/25) and observed generic entry in 65% (101/155). We concluded that expected US market exclusivity periods are similar for biologic and small molecule drugs. Statutory exclusivity plays a more substantial role in market exclusivity protection for biologics.

"Given the rising cost of long-term care (LTC) services, the selection of a private long-term care insurance (LTCi) policy with inflation protection has critical implications for the ability of this coverage to protect against potentially catastrophic LTC expenses. This study examines the effect of consumers' numeric abilities on the decision to add inflation protection to private LTCi policies. Over 40% of current LTCi policies lack inflation protection. Higher scores on a three-question numeracy scale are associated with increases in the probability of choosing inflation protection at the time of policy purchase, with households answering all three questions correctly being 12 percentage points more likely to have this benefit type relative to those with a numeracy score of 0 (p = .002). Market reforms that simplify the task of evaluating LTCi plans and assessing the value of indexed benefits may be needed to ensure that LTCi policy purchasers are selecting adequate protection against future LTC costs.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1077558718787742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009685/,economics

"Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa--the countries known as BRICS--represent some of the world's fastest growing large economies and nearly 40% of the world's population. Over the last two decades, BRICS have undertaken health-system reforms to make progress towards universal health coverage. This paper discusses three key aspects of these reforms: the role of government in financing health; the underlying motivation behind the reforms; and the value of the lessons learnt for non-BRICS countries. Although national governments have played a prominent role in the reforms, private financing constitutes a major share of health spending in BRICS. There is a reliance on direct expenditures in China and India and a substantial presence of private insurance in Brazil and South Africa. The Brazilian health reforms resulted from a political movement that made health a constitutional right, whereas those in China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa were an attempt to improve the performance of the public system and reduce inequities in access. The move towards universal health coverage has been slow. In China and India, the reforms have not adequately addressed the issue of out-of-pocket payments. Negotiations between national and subnational entities have often been challenging but Brazil has been able to achieve good coordination between federal and state entities via a constitutional delineation of responsibility. In the Russian Federation, poor coordination has led to the fragmented pooling and inefficient use of resources. In mixed health systems it is essential to harness both public and private sector resources.",https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.13.127951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24940017/,economics
"Recent litigation against the major tobacco companies culminated in a master settlement agreement (MSA) under which the participating companies agreed to compensate most states for Medicaid expenses. Here the terms of the settlement are outlined and its economic implications analyzed using data from Massachusetts. The financial compensation to Massachusetts (and other states) under the MSA is substantial. However, this compensation is dwarfed by the value of the health impacts induced by the settlement. Specifically, Medicaid spending will fall, but only by a modest amount. More importantly, the value of health benefits ($65 billion through 2025 in 1999 dollars) from increased longevity is an order of magnitude greater than any other impacts or payments. The net efficiency implications of the settlement turn mainly on a comparison of the value of these health benefits relative to a valuation of the foregone pleasure of smoking. To the extent that the value of the health benefits is not offset by the value of the pleasure foregone, the economic impacts of the MSA will include a share of these health benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.1037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11887906/,economics

"Globally, annual spending on anticancer drugs is around US$100 billion, and is predicted to rise to $150 billion by 2020. In the USA, a novel anticancer drug routinely costs more than $100,000 per year of treatment. When adjusted for per capita spending power, however, drugs are most unaffordable in economically developing nations, such as India and China. Not only are launch prices high and rising, but individual drug prices are often escalated during exclusivity periods. High drug prices harm patients - often directly through increased out-of-pocket expenses, which reduce levels of patient compliance and lead to unfavourable outcomes - and harms society - by imposing cumulative price burdens that are unsustainable. Moreover, high drug prices are not readily explained by rational factors, including the extent of benefit patients are likely to derive, the novelty of the agents, or spending on research and development. Herein, we summarize the available empirical evidence on the costs of anticancer drugs, probe the origins and implications of these high costs, and discuss proposed solutions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.31,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28290490/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      To analyse the development of pharmaceutical policy in the Dutch market for outpatient prescription drugs since the early 1990s.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      A literature review and document analysis is performed to examine the effects of pharmaceutical policy on the performance of the Dutch market for outpatient prescription drugs since the early 1990s.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Government efforts to control prices of pharmaceuticals were effective in constraining prices of in-patent drugs, but had an opposite effect on the prices of generic drugs. The gradual transition towards managed competition--that particularly gained momentum after the introduction of the new universal health insurance scheme in 2006--appears to be more effective in constraining prices of generic drugs than earlier government efforts to control these prices.
    


          Originality:
        
      
      Comparative analysis of the impact of price regulation and managed competition on generic drug prices in the Netherlands.

"Background:
        
      
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) requires complex care that generate elevated costs, which results in a high economic impact for the family. The aim of this systematic review was to collect and cluster the information currently available on healthcare costs associated with JIA after the introduction of biological therapies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We comprehensively searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Databases for studies from January 2000 to March 2021. Reviewers working independently and in duplicate appraised the quality and included primary studies that report total, direct and/or indirect costs related to JIA for at least one year. The costs were converted to United States dollars and an inflationary adjustment was made.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found 18 eligible studies including data from 6,540 patients. Total costs were reported in 10 articles, ranging from $310 USD to $44,832 USD annually. Direct costs were reported in 16 articles ($193 USD to $32,446 USD), showing a proportion of 55 to 98 % of total costs. Those costs were mostly related to medications and medical appointments. Six studies reported indirect costs ($117 USD to $12,385 USD). Four studies reported costs according to JIA category observing the highest in polyarticular JIA.

"In 1993, President Clinton created the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform as part of the administration's effort to promote economic growth and control the budget deficit. The purpose of the commission, chaired by Senator J. Robert Kerrey (D-NE) and Senator John C. Danforth (R-MO), is to seek bipartisan agreement on long-term entitlement reform and structural changes to the tax system. The final recommendations of the commission, due December 15, will be of great interest to the academic medicine community because of the importance of federal dollars to medical research and education and the crucial role of the Medicare and Medicaid programs in financing the care provided by teaching physicians and teaching hospitals. What follows is a summary of the commission's interim report submitted to the president on August 8; it reflects the commissioners' almost unanimous (30 to 1) agreement on the nature and magnitude of the entitlement problem.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-199412000-00007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7999185/,economics
"When health systems aim to improve, two key considerations tend to be front and centre: cost and quality. On the cost side, health spending in Canada continues to rise. On the quality side, improvement is needed across the country. As the primary funder of healthcare, governments' historical role has focused on managing costs through their powers to set budgets, decide who gets paid, and how. Increasingly, governments are recognizing that the ways in which they choose to pay providers and organizations can also have an impact on the quality of care provided. Using Ontario as an example, we present a Canadian vision for modernizing how healthcare is organized and reimbursed and for using evidence and evaluation as the backbone for iterating new models. Realizing this vision will move Canada closer to international leadership in delivering high-quality, affordable care.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0840470419859388,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31242775/,economics
"This study evaluated the economic impact of a policy change in adult Maryland Medicaid dental benefits that eliminated reimbursements to dentists. We examined all claims for 2 years before and after the change. Reimbursements to dentists fell to zero from their preenactment period annual rate of US 7.6 million dollars; other care settings simultaneously generated an additional US 232,470 dollars savings during the postenactment period. Medicaid's goal to reduce costs was achieved; however, disadvantaged patients may have been confused by the policy change and likely suffered poorer health outcomes and paid for treatment out of pocket, found free clinics, or received free care from generous dentists.",https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2004.0068,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15531823/,economics
"This essay argues for understanding and investigating the history of production, not primarily as a quantifiable economic phenomenon, but as a history of practice that involves the human senses, culture, governance, and material engagement. The vehicle it uses to make its case focuses on a brief examination of production cycles involving salts in various parts of Eurasia during the century that runs from approximately 1750 to 1850. The essay's approach suggests a history of production in Eurasia that was both locally variegated and transregionally networked. It further involved the interaction between people and their sociomaterial environments, the latter understood as the evolving outcome of interplay between material elements and processes; culturally rooted tastes and values; and variously organized efforts to stimulate, manage, and pursue cycles of production and use. This essay further reflects on how contemporary commentators and present-day historians have (re)configured the geography of these practices in a way that emphasizes divergence between Europe and Asia. Part of this reflection involves looking at what can happen when the historical investigation of production is based on economic analysis. So too does it involve thinking about the potential pitfalls of framing comparative histories.",https://doi.org/10.1086/684654,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27024942/,economics
"Japan's universal healthcare system is relatively inexpensive, provides accessible services, and was established nearly 10 years before Canada's. Two aspects of Japan's system are particularly interesting. The first is that there is active competition for patients between a variety of hospital providers, which can be privately or publicly owned. This competition is based on service quality because prices are set centrally. The second feature is that these prices are adjusted biannually by a National Council, the Chuikyo, that includes payers (employers), providers, and third-party experts in public negotiations. This process improves transparency, reduces political stakes, and allows for appropriate fee adjustments. Recent movements in Canada toward more activity-based funding and greater management accountability are developing the capabilities of healthcare executives to embrace these ideas, if introduced in Canada. The increased autonomy afforded to providers will empower their leaders to make strategic decisions to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare services.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0840470417698485,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28929871/,economics
"Disabled people have long advocated for sufficient resources to live a life with the same rights and responsibilities as non-disabled people. Identifying the unique resource needs of disabled people relative to the population as a whole and understanding the source of these needs is critical for determining adequate levels of income support and for prioritising service provision. Previous attempts to identify the resources and costs associated with disability have tended to rely on surveys of current resource use. These approaches have been criticised as being inadequate for identifying the resources that would be required to achieve a similar standard of living to non-disabled people and for not using methods that are acceptable to and appropriate for the disabled community. The challenge is therefore to develop a methodology that accurately identifies these unique resource needs, uses an approach that is acceptable to the disabled community, enables all disabled people to participate, and distinguishes 'needs' from 'wants.' This paper describes and presents the rationale for a mixed methodology for identifying and prioritising the resource needs of disabled people. The project is a partnership effort between disabled researchers, a disability support organisation and academic researchers in New Zealand. The method integrates a social model of disability framework and an economic cost model using a budget standards approach to identify additional support, equipment, travel and time required to live an 'ordinary life' in the community. A survey is then used to validate the findings and identify information gaps and resource priorities of the community. Both the theoretical basis of the approach and the practical challenges of designing and implementing a methodology that is acceptable to the disabled community, service providers and funding agencies are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.08.019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20933315/,economics
"Aims:
        
      
      To date there has been limited analysis of the economic costs and benefits associated with cannabis legalisation. This study redresses this gap. A cost benefit analysis of two cannabis policy options the status quo (where cannabis use is illegal) and a legalised-regulated option was conducted.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A cost benefit analysis was used to value the costs and benefits of the two policies in monetary terms. Costs and benefits of each policy option were classified into five categories (direct intervention costs, costs or cost savings to other agencies, benefits or lost benefits to the individual or the family, other impacts on third parties, and adverse or spill over events). The results are expressed as a net social benefit (NSB).
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The mean NSB per annum from Monte Carlo simulations (with the 5 and 95 percentiles) for the status quo was $294.6 million AUD ($201.1 to $392.7 million) not substantially different from the $234.2 million AUD ($136.4 to $331.1 million) for the legalised-regulated model which excludes government revenue as a benefit. When government revenue is included, the NSB for legalised-regulated is higher than for status quo. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the significant impact of educational attainment and wellbeing as drivers for the NSB result.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Examining the percentiles around the two policy options, there appears to be no difference between the NSB for these two policy options. Economic analyses are essential for good public policy, providing information about the extent to which one policy is substantially economically favourable over another. In cannabis policy, for these two options this does not appear to be the case.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095569,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24755942/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Economic analysis is an important tool in deciding how to allocate scarce public health resources; however, there is currently a dearth of such analysis by public health researchers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Public health researchers and practitioners were surveyed to determine their current use of health economics and to identify barriers to use as well as potential strategies to decrease those barriers in order to allow them to more effectively incorporate economic analyses into their work. Data collected from five focus groups informed survey development. The survey included a demographic section and 14 multi-part questions. Participants were recruited in 2006 from three national public health organizations through e-mail; 294 academicians, practitioners, and community representatives answered the survey.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Survey data were analyzed in 2007. Despite an expressed belief in the importance of health economics, more than half of the respondents reported very little or no current use of health economics in their work. Of those using health economics, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis and determination of public health costs were cited as the measures used most frequently. The most important barriers were lack of expertise, funding, time, tools, and data, as well as discomfort with economic theory. The resource deemed most important to using health economics was collaboration with economists or those with economic training. Respondents indicated a desire to learn more about health economics and tools for performing economic analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Given the importance of incorporating economic analysis into public health interventions, and the desire of survey respondents for more collaboration with health economists, opportunities for such collaborations should be increased.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2008.11.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19215853/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      This review evaluates costs and benefits associated with acquiring, implementing, and operating clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Methods developed for the Community Guide were used to review CDSS literature covering the period from January 1976 to October 2015. Twenty-one studies were identified for inclusion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      It was difficult to draw a meaningful estimate for the cost of acquiring and operating CDSSs to prevent CVD from the available studies ( n = 12) due to considerable heterogeneity. Several studies ( n = 11) indicated that health care costs were averted by using CDSSs but many were partial assessments that did not consider all components of health care. Four cost-benefit studies reached conflicting conclusions about the net benefit of CDSSs based on incomplete assessments of costs and benefits. Three cost-utility studies indicated inconsistent conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness based on a conservative $50,000 threshold.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Intervention costs were not negligible, but specific estimates were not derived because of the heterogeneity of implementation and reporting metrics. Expected economic benefits from averted health care cost could not be determined with confidence because many studies did not fully account for all components of health care.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We were unable to conclude whether CDSSs for CVD prevention is either cost-beneficial or cost-effective. Several evidence gaps are identified, most prominently a lack of information about major drivers of cost and benefit, a lack of standard metrics for the cost of CDSSs, and not allowing for useful life of a CDSS that generally extends beyond one accounting period.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocw160,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049635/,economics
"Economic expansion gives rise to modern and energy-efficient technologies and, thus, contributes to a decline in energy usage. Developing countries, including Pakistan, require tremendous efforts to sustain economic growth. However, to attain economic growth, these countries have to cope with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental problems. This research focuses primarily on the asymmetric impacts of energy consumption and economic growth on Pakistan's environmental quality. Accordingly, secondary data spanning from 1971 to 2018 was used, and carbon dioxide emission (CO2) was considered a target variable (a proxy for environmental quality), whereas energy consumption (E) and gross domestic product (GDP) as a proxy for economic growth, and trade accessibility (TR) and foreign direct investment (FDI) as control variables. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach is used to verify the asymmetric co-integration between the variables selected. Moreover, to examine data stationarity and nonlinearity, we used the Zivot-Andrews structural break unit root and BDS tests, respectively. The findings confirmed the asymmetric and symmetric co-integrations among the considered variables. In addition, the causality analysis reveals that only negative shocks to TR have an effect on CO2 emissions. Similarly, negative shocks to FDI asymmetrically cause CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, GDP symmetrically affects CO2 emissions. Finally, a neutral causal response was observed between E and CO2 emissions. These findings have policy implications in terms of environmental management and carbon neutrality, and they serve as a baseline for future research.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16612-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34611808/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      After licensing of a varicella vaccine in Canada in 1998, Health Canada commissioned a study to evaluate options for a vaccination program. The evaluation of a program of vaccination of 12-month-old children, with and without a catch-up program for susceptible 12-year-olds, is presented here.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An economic model was developed simulating the expected experience, with and without vaccination, of cohorts of children susceptible to varicella. The cohorts were simulated for 70 years, and infection and complication rates were calculated along with the attendant costs, with an assumed vaccine cost of $60.
    


          Results:
        
      
      With an 85% coverage rate vaccination is expected to reduce the number of chickenpox cases by approximately two-thirds and varicella-related complications by up to 75%. The overall costs of varicella are expected to drop by >$4 million (1998 Canadian dollars) per 100,000 eligible vaccinees, but costs to the health care system are expected to increase by >$2 million. From the health care system perspective, vaccination would cost approximately $42 per discounted case avoided.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Routine varicella vaccination would likely substantially reduce the overall costs of managing chickenpox but would result in an increase in health care expenditures.

"Economic evaluations are increasingly being used by those bodies such as government agencies and managed care groups that make decisions about the reimbursement of health technologies. However, several reviews of economic evaluations point to numerous deficiencies in the methodology of studies or the failure to follow published methodological guidelines. This article, written for healthcare decision-makers and other users of economic evaluations, outlines the common methodological flaws in studies, focussing on those issues that are likely to be most important when deciding on the reimbursement, or guidance for use, of health technologies. The main flaws discussed are: (i) omission of important costs or benefits; (ii) inappropriate selection of alternatives for comparison; (iii) problems in making indirect comparisons; (iv) inadequate representation of the effectiveness data; (v) inappropriate extrapolation beyond the period observed in clinical studies; (vi) excessive use of assumptions rather than data; (vii) inadequate characterization of uncertainty; (viii) problems in aggregation of results; (ix) reporting of average cost-effectiveness ratios; (x) lack of consideration of generalizability issues; and (xi) selective reporting of findings.

"Most employees contribute towards the cost of employer-sponsored insurance, despite tax laws that favor zero contributions. Contribution levels vary markedly across firms, and the average contribution (as a percentage of the premium) has increased over time. We offer a novel explanation for these facts: employers raise contribution levels to encourage their employees to obtain coverage from their spouses' employer.

"Economical constraints within the health care system advocate the introduction of tighter control of costs in clinical laboratories. Detailed cost information forms the basis for cost control and financial management. Based on the cost information, proper decisions regarding priorities, procedure choices, personnel policies and investments can be made. This presentation outlines some principles of cost analysis, describes common limitations of cost analysis, and exemplifies use of software to achieve optimized cost control. One commercially available cost analysis software, LabCost, is described in some detail. In addition to provision of cost information, LabCost also serves as a general management tool for resource handling, accounting, inventory management and billing. The application of LabCost in the selection process of a new high throughput analyzer for a large clinical chemistry service is taken as an example for decisions that can be assisted by cost evaluation. It is concluded that laboratory management that wisely utilizes cost analysis to support the decision-making process will undoubtedly have a clear advantage over those laboratories that fail to employ cost considerations to guide their actions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0009-8981(97)00235-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9541753/,economics
"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and often underestimated neurological disorder, with a prevalence ranging from approximately 2.5% to 10% in Western industrialized countries. The aim of the present study was to summarize the research findings on the human and economic costs associated with RLS in populations without any co-morbidities or potentially confounding health conditions. A further objective was to identify studies on the cost effectiveness of RLS treatments. A systematic literature search was performed. Two researchers independently assessed the relevance of each publication. Studies published before August 2008 were included if they assessed quality of life in patients suffering from RLS, determined total or patient-related costs attributable to RLS, and/or evaluated the cost effectiveness of treatment options for RLS. A total of 725 references were identified, including 100 full-text articles. Fifteen of these publications met all of the selection criteria and were included in the present review. Seven abstracts that focused on the economic burden of RLS and/or the cost effectiveness of different treatment strategies in RLS patients were also included. RLS was associated, in the included studies, with reductions in quality of life similar to those seen in patients with other chronic conditions. The cost-of-illness studies were heterogeneous but indicated that RLS was associated with a substantial economic burden, resulting in high direct and indirect costs to society. Although effective and cost-effective treatments appear to be available, further research is warranted, especially regarding the economic burden of RLS and the cost effectiveness of available treatment options.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200927040-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19485424/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Market power among dental insurance carriers is a carrier's ability to reimburse dentists at rates below what would exist in more competitive areas. Competition among carriers for dentists' participation in their networks protects dentists from highly discounted fees. The authors examined the extent to which dental insurance carriers facing less competition increase fee discounts.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The authors selected a sample of dentists from listings of general practitioners. They identified 219 metropolitan areas and contacted 11,542 dentists in those areas by mail, telephone or both. A total of 8,017 dentists completed surveys (a response rate of 69.46 percent). The authors' key focus was the possible relationship between carrier market power and the size of the fee discount. The authors compared discounts across metropolitan areas with their differing levels of insurance coverage and carrier market shares.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Carrier market power was directly related to the sizes of fee discounts. The larger discounts were found where there was significant dental insurance coverage and few carriers providing this coverage. Dentists' net incomes were significantly less in areas with larger fee discounts.
    


          Conclusions and practice implications:
        
      
      Dental insurance carrier market power leads to increased fee discounts. These higher discounts reduce dentists' earnings. Although the larger discounts may result in lower overall patient costs, this patient benefit is temporary. Ultimately, the number of practicing dentists in these communities will decrease as dentists seek improved practicing conditions elsewhere. This reduction will lead to overall fee increases until the earning potential of dentists is restored.",https://doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.2009.0024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19119173/,economics

"The 2006 Enthoven-inspired Dutch health insurance reform, based on regulated competition with a mandate for individuals to purchase insurance, will interest U.S. policy makers who seek universal coverage. This ongoing experiment includes guaranteed issue, price competition for a standardized basic benefits package, community rating, sliding-scale income-based subsidies for patients, and risk equalization for insurers. Our assessment of the first two years is based on Dutch Central Bank statistics, national opinion polls, consumer surveys, and qualitative interviews with policy makers. The first lesson for the United States is that the new Dutch health insurance model may not control costs. To date, consumer premiums are increasing, and insurance companies report large losses on the basic policies. Second, regulated competition is unlikely to make voters/citizens happy; public satisfaction is not high, and perceived quality is down. Third, consumers may not behave as economic models predict, remaining responsive to price incentives. Finally, policy makers should not underestimate the opposition from health care providers who define their profession as more than simply a job. If regulated competition with individual mandates performs poorly in auspicious circumstances such as the Netherlands, how will this model fare in the United States, where access, quality, and cost challenges are even greater? Might the assumptions of economic theory not apply in the health sector?",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2008-033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19038869/,economics
"Rising health care costs are a policy concern across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and relatively little consensus exists concerning their causes. One explanation that has received revived attention is Baumol's cost disease (BCD). However, developing a theoretically appropriate test of BCD has been a challenge. In this paper, we construct a 2-sector model firmly based on Baumol's axioms. We then derive several testable propositions. In particular, the model predicts that (a) the share of total labor employed in the health care sector and (b) the relative price index of the health and non-health care sectors should both be positively related to economy-wide productivity. The model also predicts that (c) the share of labor in the health sector will be negatively related and (d) the ratio of prices in the health and non-health sectors unrelated, to the demand for non-health services. Using annual data from 28 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the years 1995-2016 and from 14 U.S. industry groups over the years 1947-2015, we find little evidence to support the predictions of BCD once we address spurious correlation due to coincident trending and other econometric issues.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3641,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29423941/,economics
"This article examines performance-based risk-sharing agreements for pharmaceuticals from a theoretical economic perspective. We position these agreements as a form of coverage with evidence development. New performance-based risk sharing could produce a more efficient market equilibrium, achieved by adjustment of the price post-launch to reflect outcomes combined with a new approach to the post-launch costs of evidence collection. For this to happen, the party best able to manage or to bear specific risks must do so. Willingness to bear risk will depend not only on ability to manage it, but on the degree of risk aversion. We identify three related frameworks that provide relevant insights: value of information, real option theory and money-back guarantees. We identify four categories of risk sharing: budget impact, price discounting, outcomes uncertainty and subgroup uncertainty. We conclude that a value of information/real option framework is likely to be the most helpful approach for understanding the costs and benefits of risk sharing. There are a number of factors that are likely to be crucial in determining if performance-based or risk-sharing agreements are efficient and likely to become more important in the future: (i) the cost and practicality of post-launch evidence collection relative to pre-launch; (ii) the feasibility of coverage with evidence development without a pre-agreed contract as to how the evidence will be used to adjust price, revenues or use, in which uncertainty around the pay-off to additional research will reduce the incentive for the manufacturer to collect the information; (iii) the difficulty of writing and policing risk-sharing agreements; (iv) the degree of risk aversion (and therefore opportunity to trade) on the part of payers and manufacturers; and (v) the extent of transferability of data from one country setting to another to support coverage with evidence development in a risk-sharing framework. There is no doubt that--in principle--risk sharing can provide manufacturers and payers additional real options that increase overall efficiency. Given the lack of empirical evidence on the success of schemes already agreed and on the issues we set out above, it is too early to tell if the recent surge of interest in these arrangements is likely to be a trend or only a fad.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11314080-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20085386/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this research is to review the economic methods used in complementary medicine (CM).
    


          Method:
        
      
      A comprehensive literature review was undertaken (1995-2007) to identify peer-reviewed articles related to economic methods used in CM.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The literature found 15 full economic evaluations of CM: 3 in the manipulative and body-based practices, 5 in the whole medical systems, and 7 in the biologically based practices. No evaluations were identified for the areas of mind-body medicine, alternative medical systems, or energy medicine. The review failed to locate any articles that used alternate economic methods such as contingent valuation or discrete choice modelling. The overall consensus from the 15 economic evaluations, despite variations in project design and methodological rigor, was that CM, as evaluated in these studies, was cost-effective compared to usual care.
    


          Conclusions:

"This paper presents the findings of a systematic review of full or partial economic evaluations that included questions to service users or their carers to elicit information on the types, amounts or costs of community-based formal social care support provided to people 65 years and older. We have found that studies seldom report use of published validated questions for eliciting information from older people in the UK about their use of formal social care services. Given the political prominence of the debate over funding social care for older people, there remains a need for analysis of policy options. This requires reliable data on the receipt and payment for care. We recommend the development of improved questions on care that are clear, robust and up-to-date with developments in policy and practice.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21751293/,economics
"Several studies that measured the financial impact of hospitals on their local markets are examined. Descriptive analyses were performed to ascertain if there are any identifying characteristics and emerging patterns in the data. After hospitals were categorized into small, medium, and large classifications based on the number of employees, various predictive insights were discovered. Smaller hospitals could be expected to contribute approximately 7.3% to the local economy, whereas medium-sized hospitals would likely contribute approximately 11.4% to the financial value of the local market. Finally, larger hospitals may contribute approximately 16% to their local economies.",https://doi.org/10.1097/hcm.0000000000000144,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28005565/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To describe and compare price regulation and reimbursement in the Czech Republic and Sweden.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Legal documents, government reports, statutory information, annual reports and scientific articles were searched using the keywords: pharmaceutical market regulation, drug policy, drug pricing, drug reimbursement and patients' participation in costs concerning both countries. Approaches to regulation and regulatory steps concerning prices were compared between the countries.
    


          Main outcome measure:
        
      
      (i) Institutional responsibilities in pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals; (ii) principles of patients' participation in costs on pharmaceuticals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Substantial differences were found in terms of pricing. In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance sets maximal prices for pharmaceuticals whereas in Sweden there is a process of price regulation combined with reimbursement decisions taken by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Board. Together with a system of state-owned pharmacies, this ensures that drug prices in Sweden are fixed at the same level throughout the country. In the Czech Republic, prices may differ, since only maximal price levels are set. In both countries, decisions about reimbursement are taken at the national or state level whereas insurance funds or county councils are responsible for covering costs. The private share of pharmaceutical expenditures is substantially lower in the Czech Republic, even though there is no maximal level for patient's co-payment, as there is in Sweden.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Differences in price setting and some other regulations of the pharmaceutical market were found. Both systems are designed to promote rational use of pharmaceuticals; and are based on social solidarity.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-007-9141-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17588212/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Despite the availability of free tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment, TB care still generates substantial costs that push people into poverty. We investigated out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for TB care and assessed the resulting economic burden and economic consequences for those with varying levels of household income in eastern China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study was conducted among TB patients in the national TB programme networks in eastern China. TB-related direct OOP costs, time loss, and coping strategies were investigated across households in different economic strata. Analysis of Variance was used to examine the differences in various costs, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the difference in total costs as a percentage of annual household income.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 435 patients, the mean OOP total costs of TB care were USD 2389.5. In the lower-income quartile, OOP payments were lower, but costs as a percentage of reported annual household income were higher. Medical costs and costs prior to treatment accounted for 66.4 and 48.9% of the total costs, respectively. The lower the household income was, the higher the proportion of medical costs to total costs before TB treatment, but the lower the proportion of medical costs patients spent in the intensive phase. TB care caused 25.8% of TB-affected households to fall below the poverty line and caused the poverty gap (PG) to increase by United States Dollar (USD) 145.6. Patients in the poorest households had the highest poverty headcount ratio (70.2%) and PG (USD 236.1), but those in moderately poor households had the largest increase in the poverty headcount ratio (36.2%) and PG (USD 177.8) due to TB care. Patients from poor households were more likely to borrow money to cope with the costs of TB care; however, there were fewer social consequences, except for food insecurity, in poor households.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medical and pretreatment costs lead to high costs of TB care, especially among patients from the poorest households. It is necessary to train health system staff in general hospitals to promptly identify and refer TB patients. Pro-poor programmes are also needed to protect TB patients from the medical poverty trap.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-0623-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32019611/,economics
"Owing to rising population and increasing energy demand, renewable energy resources become the most convenient and promising solution. Hence, solar power plant investments and photovoltaic module numbers have risen sharply. Turkey is one of the tight followers of the energy trends, thanks to its rising energy demand and economic power. However, the consequences of the massive plant wastes importance in term of economically and environmentally have not been understood yet. Almost 70% of the modules are formed by glass and the rest accumulates economically valuable metal materials, which are silver, aluminium and copper. These three main materials are substantially important in the overall waste. Not only the economic value, but also the environmental impacts of the mining effluents to excavate these metals are causing emission problems. As a chain reaction, the higher energy demand triggers a search for new and renewable energy resources. This is why popularity of solar energy has increased. Solar energy can be absorbed and transformed through photovoltaic modules, which contain glass and three main metals. In order to respond for the production of modules, metals are fundamental. This need triggers the need of metals mining excavations and emissions. In this respect, in the near future, thanks to the rising investments on photovoltaic modules and the CO2 emissions coming from mining, the wastes of photovoltaic modules and the need of recycling will become more important. That is why, in this study it is aimed to present environmental benefits and economic recoveries of recycling photovoltaic module in Turkey.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x19826331,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30786832/,economics
"This article aims to examine barriers to the efficient use of resources relating to medical devices, by focusing specifically on an economic analysis of the market structure of medical devices and on the assessment procedures for medical devices. A desktop analysis was conducted of the health economic literature relating to both of these aspects. This information was structured and analysed with a view to identifying and discussing the major issues that may threaten the efficient use of medical devices. Medical device sectors do not tend to operate as perfectly competitive markets because of the presence of heterogeneous products, information asymmetry and a restricted number of manufacturers. There is a need for government intervention to keep prices down, restrict public reimbursement and promote an efficient use of medical devices. Assessment procedures governing pricing and reimbursement of medical devices are lacking, are in development, or have only recently been established in the majority of developed countries. There is limited transparency and less formal attention of decision makers to assessment of the efficient use of resources in medical device sectors as compared with medicines. In conclusion, there is a need for more studies exploring the safety, effectiveness, cost effectiveness and budget impact of medical devices, so that decision makers can make informed pricing and reimbursement decisions based on objective analyses. Additionally, there is a need for more formal assessment systems for medical devices.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03256154,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19905034/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To calculate and compare costs of neonatal intensive care by micro-costing and gross-costing methods.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The costs of resources of a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit were estimated by the two methods to arrive at specific costs per diagnosis related categories for 33 neonates followed-up prospectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Gross-costing as compared to micro-costing resulted in higher cost per bed (Rs 6315 vs. Rs 4969) and wide variations of costs (-34.8% to +13.4%). Intensity of interventions, relative stay in neonatal intensive care unit compared to the step-down nursery, and total length of hospital admission accounted for these variations.

"This study analyzes a telemedical program for chronic heart failure in Germany with respect to economic and treatment indicators. The program entails a routine data-based preselection of the insured and specific treatment intensities for low- and high-risk patients. This study complements previous research by considering differentiated end points such as mortality and rehospitalization as well as ambulatory, outpatient, and medication costs to account for potential cost shifts. In addition, different time frames and regional characteristics are dealt with. A difference-in-differences approach accounts for potential self-selection into the voluntary program. Our results challenge the current paradigm of program-induced cost shifting between hospital and ambulatory care. Except for a short-term effect in the lower-risk group, the program is associated with raising hospital admission rates as well as higher costs in all categories, while mortality is significantly reduced.

"Using Medicare cost reports, we examined the fifty US hospitals with the highest charge-to-cost ratios in 2012. These hospitals have markups (ratios of charges over Medicare-allowable costs) approximately ten times their Medicare-allowable costs compared to a national average of 3.4 and a mode of 2.4. Analysis of the fifty hospitals showed that forty-nine are for profit (98 percent), forty-six are owned by for-profit hospital systems (92 percent), and twenty (40 percent) operate in Florida. One for-profit hospital system owns half of these fifty hospitals. While most public and private health insurers do not use hospital charges to set their payment rates, uninsured patients are commonly asked to pay the full charges, and out-of-network patients and casualty and workers' compensation insurers are often expected to pay a large portion of the full charges. Because it is difficult for patients to compare prices, market forces fail to constrain hospital charges. Federal and state governments may want to consider limitations on the charge-to-cost ratio, some form of all-payer rate setting, or mandated price disclosure to regulate hospital markups.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1414,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056196/,economics
"With an increasing trend in health care consumption--together with the introduction of an increasing number of new medical technologies-- governments, insurance companies and other third party payers seek new ways of limiting increases in consumption, as well as limiting the use of new medical technologies to the most efficient ones (clinically, economically). One particular area of focus in this context is the pharmaceutical sector, where the innovational rate of new technologies (drugs) has been high. One of the forerunners in the areas of health care cost containment and regulatory health economics is Norway. This country has succeeded in keeping drug prices and drug consumption at moderate levels, as well as keeping the number of new drugs to a relatively modest level. This study describes the Norwegian drug regulatory process, the Norwegian drug market, the Norwegian cost-containment policies and future regulatory perspectives. For many European countries and in North America, where stricter price and reimbursement regulations are considered, the Norwegian drug regulatory process presents an interesting example of how a strict regulatory environment may affect the availability of drugs, as well as drug prices, drug reimbursement and drug consumption.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(92)90126-v,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10171032/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Measures taken over the past four years in Greece to reduce pharmaceutical expenditure have led to significant price reductions for medicines, but have also changed patient cost-sharing rates for prescription drugs. This study attempts to capture the resulting increase in patients' out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses for prescription drugs during the 2011-2014 period.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The authors conducted a retrospective review of financial data derived from 39 883 prescriptions, dispensed at three randomly chosen pharmacies located in Lamia, central Greece.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study recorded an average contribution rate per prescription as follows: 11.28% for 2011 (95% CI: 10.76-11.80), 14.10% for 2012, 19.97% for 2013, and 29.08% for 2014. Correspondingly, the mean patient charge per prescription for 2011 was €6.58 (95% CI: 6.22-6.94), €8.28 for 2012, €8.35 for 2013, and €10.87 for 2014. During the 2011-2014 period, mean percentage rate of patient contribution increased by 157.75%, while average patient charge per prescription in current prices increased by 65.22%. The use of a newly introduced internal reference price (IRP) system increased the level of prescription charge at a rate of 2.41% for 2012 (100% surcharge on patients), 26.24% for 2013 (49.95% on patients and 50.04% on the appropriate health insurance funds), and 47.72% for 2014 (85.06% on patients and 14.94% on funds).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Increased cost-sharing rates for prescription drugs can reduce public pharmaceutical expenditure, but international experience shows that rising OOP expenses can compromise patients' ability to pay, particularly when it comes to chronic diseases and vulnerable populations.

"Previous studies of economic content in medical journal advertisements have not examined all types of economic content and have not included advertisements for medical devices. To examine trends in the economic content of medical device and pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals. Three reviewers examined pharmaceutical and medical device advertisements in six leading medical journals from 1997 through 2006. Product characteristics, economic claims and evidence to support those claims were evaluated. Economic content appeared in 23.5% (561/2389) of pharmaceutical and device advertisements; 11.9% made market share claims and 12.7% made other economic claims. From 1997 through 2006, the percentage of medical device advertisements containing economic content declined from 26.7% to 6.7% (p = 0.02), whereas the percentage of pharmaceutical advertisements containing economic content remained stable (21.6-22.0%; p = 0.99). For pharmaceuticals, price claims declined significantly (15.7-4.2%; p < 0.01) and market share claims increased (2.8-11.5%; p = 0.09), and both consistently presented evidence (83% and 98%, respectively) while other types did not (e.g. 13.5% of formulary claims). Medical device economic claims differed from pharmaceutical economic claims; they made fewer market share claims (1.1% vs 12.8%) but more cost-effectiveness (6.5% vs 0.6%) and reimbursement (4.9% vs 0.8%) claims. Fewer than 2% of device advertisements with economic claims provided supporting evidence. The prevalence and type of economic content in pharmaceutical and device advertisements changed between 1997 and 2006, which may reflect evolving market dynamics, such as changes in reimbursement systems. Furthermore, the lack of supporting evidence in medical device advertisements and pharmaceutical formulary claims are potential areas of concern that require additional scrutiny by regulators and journal editors.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11318780-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20402543/,economics
"Papers dealing with the economic evaluation of health care have proliferated in the clinical literature. They provide an evidence-based element to help policy makers allocate resources among competing projects. These studies are generally done from a the perspective of a health provider (public or practice) or a public health professional, they do not take into account the special nature of the patient-physician relationship. The value of these studies for a clinician caring for an individual patient is questioned because the perspective used and the values measured represent those of society or a health provider, not those of patients. In addition, since cost-effectiveness analysis fails to take into account important societal ethical beliefs that are relevant to the care of individuals, its application to individual care is limited.

"Background:
        
      
      The increasing number of patients co-affected with Diabetes and TB may place individuals with low socio-economic status at particular risk of persistent poverty. Kyrgyz health sector reforms aim at reducing this burden, with the provision of essential health services free at the point of use through a State-Guaranteed Benefit Package (SGBP). However, despite a declining trend in out-of-pocket expenditure, there is still a considerable funding gap in the SGBP. Using data from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, this study aims to explore how households cope with the economic burden of Diabetes, TB and co-prevalence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study uses cross-sectional data collected in 2010 from Diabetes and TB patients in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Quantitative questionnaires were administered to 309 individuals capturing information on patients' socioeconomic status and a range of coping strategies. Coarsened exact matching (CEM) is used to generate socio-economically balanced patient groups. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression are used for data analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TB patients are much younger than Diabetes and co-affected patients. Old age affects not only the health of the patients, but also the patient's socio-economic context. TB patients are more likely to be employed and to have higher incomes while Diabetes patients are more likely to be retired. Co-affected patients, despite being in the same age group as Diabetes patients, are less likely to receive pensions but often earn income in informal arrangements. Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments are higher for Diabetes care than for TB care. Diabetes patients cope with the economic burden by using social welfare support. TB patients are most often in a position to draw on income or savings. Co-affected patients are less likely to receive social welfare support than Diabetes patients. Catastrophic health spending is more likely in Diabetes and co-affected patients than in TB patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study shows that while OOP are moderate for TB affected patients, there are severe consequences for Diabetes affected patients. As a result of the underfunding of the SGBP, Diabetes and co-affected patients are challenged by OOP. Especially those who belong to lower socio-economic groups are challenged in coping with the economic burden.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-016-1369-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27048370/,economics
The implications of competition amongst providers in both private and public systems for the quality of service and the number of care providers are analysed. Strong conditions must be imposed on preferences and cost conditions for quality to be efficiently supplied. In a median voter model of a public system the capitation fee and quality are lower than under competitive market equilibria and the number of practices inefficiently small. Entry control by a union which maximises gross provider income reduces the number of practices until the market is only just covered.,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(98)00046-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10537898/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Asynchrony between patient and ventilator breaths is associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) controls MV through an esophageal reading of diaphragm electrical activity via a nasogastric tube mounted with electrode rings. NAVA has been shown to decrease asynchrony in comparison to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The objective of this study was to conduct a health economic evaluation of NAVA compared with PSV.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We developed a model based on an indirect link between improved synchrony with NAVA versus PSV and fewer days spent on MV in synchronous patients. Unit costs for MV were obtained from the Swedish intensive care unit register, and used in the model along with NAVA-specific costs. The importance of each parameter (proportion of asynchronous patients, costs, and average MV duration) for the overall results was evaluated through sensitivity analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Base case results showed that 21% of patients ventilated with NAVA were asynchronous versus 52% of patients receiving PSV. This equals an absolute difference of 31% and an average of 1.7 days less on MV and a total cost saving of US$7886 (including NAVA catheter costs). A breakeven analysis suggested that NAVA was cost effective compared with PSV given an absolute difference in the proportion of asynchronous patients greater than 2.5% (49.5% versus 52% asynchronous patients with NAVA and PSV, respectively). The base case results were stable to changes in parameters, such as difference in asynchrony, duration of ventilation and daily intensive care unit costs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study showed economically favorable results for NAVA versus PSV. Our results show that only a minor decrease in the proportion of asynchronous patients with NAVA is needed for investments to pay off and generate savings. Future studies need to confirm this result by directly relating improved synchrony to the number of days on MV.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1753465815603659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26424363/,economics

Under the assumption that there are two groups of consumers who are segmented by their insurance status, high insurance coverage and low insurance coverage consumers, the models indicate that the decisive factor is the market share of the high insurance coverage consumer and the size of cross-substitute factor relative to certain characteristics of market demand. The paper analyses both the case of only true generic entry and the case of pseudo-generic and true generic entry. The models prove that a brand-name price will increase when both the market share of high insurance coverage consumer and the factor of cross-substitute are small.

"Objective:
        
      
      The growing demand for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) associated with the efforts to contain healthcare expenditure by advanced economies necessitates the use of economically effective technologies in TKA. The present analysis based on activity-based costing (ABC) model was carried out to estimate the economic value of patient-matched instrumentation (PMI) compared to standard surgical instrumentation in TKA.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      The costs of the two approaches, PMI and standard instrumentation in TKA, were determined by the use of ABC which measures the cost of a particular procedure by determining the activities involved and adding the cost of each activity. Improvement in productivity due to increased operating room (OR) turn-around times was determined and potential additional revenue to the hospital by the efficient utilization of gained OR time was estimated.

      Increased efficiency in the usage of OR and utilization of surgical trays were noted with patient-specific approach. Potential revenues to the hospital were estimated with the use of PMI by efficient utilization of time saved in OR. Additional revenues of <euro>78,240 per year were estimated considering utilization of gained OR time to perform surgeries other than TKA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The analysis suggests that use of PMI in TKA is economically effective when compared to standard instrumentation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-012-1667-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23242451/,economics
"Several European countries have followed the USA in introducing prospective payment for hospitals with the expectation of achieving cost efficiency gains. This article examines whether theoretical expectations of cost efficiency gains can be empirically confirmed. In contrast to previous studies, the analysis of hospitals in Switzerland provides a comparison of a retrospective per diem payment system with a prospective global budget and a payment per patient case system. Using a sample of approximately 90 public financed Swiss hospitals during the years 2004-2009 and Bayesian inference of a standard and a random parameter frontier model, cost efficiency gains are found, particularly with payment per patient case. Prospective payment, designed to put hospitals at operating risk, is more effective in terms of cost reduction than the retrospective alternative. However, hospitals are heterogeneous with respect to their production technologies, making a random parameter frontier model the superior specification for Switzerland.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-014-0581-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24715440/,economics
"The economic evaluation of health technologies has become a major tool in health policy in Europe for prioritizing the allocation of health resources and the approval of new technologies. The objective of this proposal was to develop guidelines for the economic evaluation of health technologies in Spain. A group of researchers specialized in economic evaluation of health technologies developed the document reported here, following the initiative of other countries in this framework, to provide recommendations for the standardization of methodology applicable to economic evaluation of health technologies in Spain. Recommendations appear under 17 headings or sections. In each case, the recommended requirements to be satisfied by economic evaluation of health technologies are provided. Each recommendation is followed by a commentary providing justification and compares and contrasts the proposals with other available alternatives. The economic evaluation of health technologies should have a role in assessing health technologies, providing useful information for decision making regarding their adoption, and they should be transparent and based on scientific evidence.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-010-0244-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20405159/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The goal of the authors' research was to determine the national economic impact of expenditures arising from the provision of dental services.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The authors used a well-known and accepted methodology in economics known as input-output analysis to measure the economic impact. These models describe--among other things--the interrelationships between businesses, government, households and the foreign sector with regard to where inputs come from and where outputs go.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For 2000, national expenditures attributable to the provision of dental services were calculated at dollar 203.6 billion. Dentistry accounted for more than two million jobs nationwide. Taxes generated directly or indirectly from dental activity totaled more than dollar 33 billion. The annual impact of one additional dentist on the economy was estimated at dollar 1,278,253.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dentistry provides substantial local and national economic benefits, including increased economic activity, employment and tax revenues. For small counties, an additional dentist provides a significant boost to the local economy.",https://doi.org/10.14219/jada.archive.2004.0186,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15058625/,economics
"What has been the effect of competition from parallel imports on prices of locally sourced on-patent drugs? Did the 2002 Swedish mandatory substitution reform increase this competition? To answer these questions, we carried out difference-in-differences estimation on monthly data for a panel of all locally sourced on-patent prescription drugs sold in Sweden during the 40 months from January 2001 to April 2004. On average, facing competition from parallel imports caused a 15-17% fall in price. While the reform increased the effect of competition from parallel imports, it was only by 0.9%. The reform, however, did increase the effect of therapeutic competition by 1.6%.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-014-0646-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25404013/,economics
"The paper seeks to analyse the evolution of expenditure on private health insurance (PHI) in Spain. We consider the factors that influence PHI demand and level of spending before and during the economic recession, along with identifying the effect of the recession on these factors.

Due to the data structure and the demand function, the analysis is performed using a sample selection model in order to avoid sample selection bias. We estimate three models: a pre-recession model (2006), a model for the recession period (2012) and a third one covering both periods (2006 and 2012) and where we include a dummy variable that establishes the effect of the economic recession.

"This study examines the determinants of spending on social security programs. We draw predictions from industrialism and dependency theories for the explanation of social security programs. The explanations are tested with data on seventy-five nations, representative of core, semipheripheral and peripheral nations. Industrialization variables such as the percentage of older adults and economic productivity have strong effects in models involving all nations, as does multinational corporate (MNC) penetration in extraction, particularly when region is controlled; such penetration is negatively associated with spending on social security. We then look at industrialism and dependency effects for peripheral and non-core nations alone. The effects of all industrialization variables, except economic productivity, appear insignificant for peripheral nations, while the effects of region and multinational corporate penetration in extractive and agricultural industries appears significant. Models involving all non-core nations (peripheral and semi-peripheral) look more like models for all nations than for peripheral nations alone.",https://doi.org/10.2190/wfr2-tc6a-jx3l-f0qa,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2055660/,economics
"The last century has seen the ascendance of a core economic model, which we will refer to as Walrasian economics. This model is driven by the psychological assumptions that humans act only in a self-referential and narrowly rational way and that production can be described as a self-contained circular flow between firms and households. These assumptions have critical implications for the way economics is used to inform conservation biology. Yet the Walrasian model is inconsistent with a large body of empirical evidence about actual human behavior, and it violates a number of basic physical laws. Research in behavioral science and neuroscience shows that humans are uniquely social animals and not self-centered rational economic beings. Economic production is subject to physical laws including the laws of thermodynamics and mass balance. In addition, some contemporary economic theory, spurred by exciting new research in human behavior and a wealth of data about the negative global impact of the human economy on natural systems, is moving toward a world view that places consumption and production squarely in its behavioral and biophysical context. We argue that abandoning the straightjacket of the Walrasian core is essential to further progress in understanding the complex, coupled interactions between the human economy and the natural world. We call for a new framework for economic theory and policy that is consistent with observed human behavior, recognizes the complex and frequently irreversible interaction between human and natural systems, and directly confronts the cumulative negative effects of the human economy on the Earth's life support systems. Biophysical economics and ecological economics are two emerging economic frameworks in this movement.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01563.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20825448/,economics
"Micro-costing data collection tools often used in literature include standardized comprehensive templates, targeted questionnaires, activity logs, on-site administrative databases, and direct observation. These tools are not mutually exclusive and are often used in combination. Each tool has unique merits and limitations, and some may be more applicable than others under different circumstances. Proper application of micro-costing tools can produce quality cost estimates and enhance the usefulness of economic evaluations to inform resource allocation decisions. A common method to derive both fixed and variable costs of an intervention involves collecting data from the bottom up for each resource consumed (micro-costing). We scanned economic evaluation literature published in 2008-2018 and identified micro-costing data collection tools used. We categorized the identified tools and discuss their practical applications in an example study of health interventions, including their potential strengths and weaknesses. Sound economic evaluations of health interventions provide valuable information for justifying resource allocation decisions, planning for implementation, and enhancing the sustainability of the interventions. However, the quality of intervention cost estimates is seldom addressed in the literature. Reliable cost data forms the foundation of economic evaluations, and without reliable estimates, evaluation results, such as cost-effectiveness measures, could be misleading. In this project, we identified data collection tools often used to obtain reliable data for estimating costs of interventions that prevent and manage chronic conditions and considered practical applications to promote their use.",https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2019-000301,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32030205/,economics
"Many statements on the allocation of health care resources show an appreciation of the two criteria ""efficiency"" and ""fairness"" as two values which are to be weighed against each other in case of conflict. This article provides a critique of this model, which is conceived to rest on a hybrid (partly utilitarian, partly counter-utilitarian) basis. The most important fairness-related argument, or so it is argued, is of a sort which is incompatible with the reasons utilitarianism (or, indeed, consequentialism) provides as a basis for the efficiency criterion. If the argument is right, we have to provide another basis, at least as far as moral inhibitions are strong about taking efficiency into account. The present article does not go into detail about such an alternative. It relates to the on-going discussion on John Taurek's (1977) article about ""numbers"", especially on the so-called aggregation argument against Taurek's ""no-worse-claim"", and argues against the majority of commentators, consequentialist and deontological alike, that Taurek was right.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2005-858221,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15918120/,economics

We find that the prices for the services provided by acquired physicians increase by an average of 14.1% post-acquisition. Nearly half of this increase is attributable to the exploitation of payment rules. Price increases are larger when the acquiring hospital has a larger share of its inpatient market.

"As more people lose their health insurance, an increasing volume of uncompensated care is absorbing billions of dollars of limited resources of the nation's hospitals, health systems, and other provider organizations. As yet, no provider organization has developed a comprehensive management approach to address this growing problem. Currently, the money spent on uncompensated care is viewed as a drain on institutional bottom lines rather than as a fund dedicated to improving the health of uninsured patients and prospective patients. If an accountable executive were made responsible for managing this problem by paying for all of this care on a case-by-case basis as third parties do, uncompensated care could be eliminated. Payment for each case would come from the institutional resources no longer required for uncompensated care. There is reason to hypothesize that with effective management, a significant amount of the resources currently absorbed by uncompensated care could be shifted from excessive inpatient care to more productive, innovative community initiatives. This paper outlines a six-point management program designed to increase the income and decrease the expense currently associated with uncompensated care, while improving quality, patient satisfaction, and outcomes. The program can be carried out by an individual provider organization, or as a collaborative program involving two or more organizations. Recommended are demonstration projects to test the feasibility and net cost or cost savings of such an approach, preferably starting in one-hospital towns.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_41.4.365,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15835596/,economics

Although the alkali-catalyzed process using virgin vegetable oil had the lowest fixed capital cost, the acid-catalyzed process using waste cooking oil was more economically feasible overall, providing a lower total manufacturing cost, a more attractive after-tax rate of return and a lower biodiesel break-even price. On the basis of these economic calculations, sensitivity analyses for these processes were carried out. Plant capacity and prices of feedstock oils and biodiesel were found to be the most significant factors affecting the economic viability of biodiesel manufacture.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-8524(03)00150-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575945/,economics
"Payers are concerned that one-off ""cures"" bring great uncertainty with the consequential risk of incorrect adoption decisions, and significant budget impact from large one-off payments. Innovators worry about bias against ""cures"" in favor of repeat treatment, which is not in patients' interests. We find that even in the absence of a difference in uncertainty of outcomes, adverse pay-offs differ. The greater financial risk associated with a cure is related to the issue of treatment discontinuation, driven by irreversibility. This paper uses a stylized example to illustrate the need to separate three different elements of the issue: (i) one-off versus repeat or ongoing treatment, (ii) duration of treatment effect, and (iii) the potential role of financial arrangements or risk sharing to mitigate the financial risk to the payer. It concludes that: (i) prevalence and discontinuation issues mean that the impact on the payer of an incorrect decision is greater with a one-off treatment than a repeat therapy; (ii) with evidence collection this risk diminishes over time (a form of CED or OWR); and (iii) financial arrangements or risk sharing can eliminate differences for the payer as between one-off and repeat therapy. The impact of (iii) also addresses payer concerns about budget impact.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.03.013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31198185/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The treatment of an infected total hip arthroplasty is becoming an increasing economic problem. The additional costs of treatment are insufficiently represented in the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) categories. The aim of this study was to clarify whether the costs can be covered under the German DRG system and to identify the extent of the surplus or negative balance.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis of the treatment costs of total hip arthroplasty was carried out. Data from all patients treated at the orthopedic clinic of the University Hospital in Rostock were collected from patient records and from the hospital information system and calculation of the personnel and material costs using data from the central pharmacy and control centre of the University of Rostock.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In this study a total of 49 patients were included. The average treatment costs were 29,331.36 EUR per patient for an infected and 6,263.59 EUR for a primarily non-infected total hip arthroplasty. A comparison between the calculated and compensated costs resulted in an average deficit of 12,685.60 EUR per patient and an average surplus of 781.41 EUR per patient in the control group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      An economically viable treatment of infected total hip arthroplasty was not possible mostly due to the increased personnel and material costs but also to the lack of inclusion of the procedures in the DRG system. Further multicenter cost analysis studies and extensive quality assurance measures are necessary with respect to a comprehensive medical standard for a medically meaningful and economically reasonable treatment of periprosthetic infections.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00132-012-1939-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22653328/,economics

"A fundamental debate in social sciences concerns how individual judgments and choices, resulting from psychological mechanisms, are manifested in collective economic behavior. Economists emphasize the capacity of markets to aggregate information distributed among traders into rational equilibrium prices. However, psychologists have identified pervasive and systematic biases in individual judgment that they generally assume will affect collective behavior. In particular, recent studies have found that judged likelihoods of possible events vary systematically with the way the entire event space is partitioned, with probabilities of each of N partitioned events biased toward 1/N. Thus, combining events into a common partition lowers perceived probability, and unpacking events into separate partitions increases their perceived probability. We look for evidence of such bias in various prediction markets, in which prices can be interpreted as probabilities of upcoming events. In two highly controlled experimental studies, we find clear evidence of partition dependence in a 2-h laboratory experiment and a field experiment on National Basketball Association (NBA) and Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA World Cup) sports events spanning several weeks. We also find evidence consistent with partition dependence in nonexperimental field data from prediction markets for economic derivatives (guessing the values of important macroeconomic statistics) and horse races. Results in any one of the studies might be explained by a specialized alternative theory, but no alternative theories can explain the results of all four studies. We conclude that psychological biases in individual judgment can affect market prices, and understanding those effects requires combining a variety of methods from psychology and economics.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1206326110,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23818628/,economics

"This study examines whether American hospitals continued to engage in non-price or quality competition over the recent past as health care markets underwent fundamental structural changes and the economic incentives facing hospital managers were correspondingly altered. It also investigates the degree to which such rivalrous behavior contributes to losses in economic welfare. An econometric model of quality competition is specified that tests, among other things, for the effect of spending by the hospital to enhance the quality of output on annual changes in its share of the local (inpatient) market as well as the effects of competitive conditions in the local market on the annual sum spent on quality enhancement. The model is estimated with panel data on 195 acute care hospitals in the State of Florida for the years 1982-1988. The results suggest that quality competitive behavior continued unabated over this period and that it was stimulated as much by the growth in physician supply and alternative delivery mechanisms as it was by other competing hospitals in the local market. Furthermore, the results show that quality competition yields some inefficiency or waste, but much of it also meets the test of the market.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(92)90132-a,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1631601/,economics

Health care expenditure disaggregated on different age groups show for Sweden that in the age group 15-64 years, health care expenditure has not increased in constant prices between 1976 and 1985, but in the oldest age group, health care expenditure has increased considerable during this period. Health care expenditure in Sweden is as high as would be expected, taking into account the degree of economic development and the growth of expenditure during the 80s, and has followed that in comparable OECD countries.

"The issue of time horizons has received scant attention in discussions pertaining to health economic evaluations unlike discounting or translation of health outcomes into life-cycle measures (e.g. quality-adjusted life years or disability-adjusted life years). The available guidelines do not offer clear and consistent guidance for many problems addressed in health economic evaluations. In practice, variation of time horizons between studies for the same diseases is a matter of concern, as results on cost-effectiveness depend on the time horizon. Our paper contributes to establishing a consistent approach to setting time horizons across common types of health economic evaluations and mitigating potential bias where the choice of a time horizon may affect results of the evaluation. We find that available guidance is clear only for patient-focused interventions, but not in the presence of population-level effects owing to transmission of infections or other linkages. We distinguish between a policy period-over which an intervention is delivered or initiated-and an evaluation period over which the effects are measured. One important challenge in establishing a time horizon for evaluation is that, at least for infectious diseases, the state of the epidemic at the end of the policy period cannot be evaluated precisely and incorporated in the results of an economic evaluation. While longer policy periods partly mitigate this challenge, they are subject to greater uncertainty, and outcomes may not adequately reflect the cost-effectiveness of current policies because outcomes reflect an average over the policy period. Incremental analysis on interventions implemented in sub-periods of the policy period (especially at the beginning) potentially improves accuracy and helps to identify potential for improving cost-effectiveness by varying the path of implementation or the mix of interventions offered over time.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czaa073,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33450767/,economics

In the remaining market, the measured effect was zero. Our results suggest that some, but not all, consolidations of competing hospitals facilitate price increases.

"Despite a sound foundation in economic welfare theory, willingness to pay (WTP) has not been used as a measure of benefits in economic evaluations of health and health care to the same extent as in other fields. Some have suggested that this is due to non-economists' reluctance to placing dollar values on the benefits of health care. However, another potential reason could be uncertainties about the validity of the WTP measure. In this paper, we outline the bias problems with the WTP method, and specifically focus on hypothetical bias; i.e. whether the WTP from hypothetical elicitation methods overstates the real WTP or not. This is done by examining the literature in this field, with emphasis on economic experiments where there is a greater possibility for comparison. The findings are that hypothetical WTP in general significantly overestimates real WTP, but that calibration methods to reduce or eliminate this difference are currently being developed. We conclude that while the area is still very much under development, there seem to be reasons to view the use of cost-benefit analysis as a reasonable alternative to the more common cost-effectiveness analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(00)00067-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10899644/,economics

"Introduction:
        
      
      We simulate and analyze Total Health Expenditure (THE) in financial sources and other economic indicators (such as THE per capita, GDP, etc.) in a province of China from 2002 to 2012 on System Dynamics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Based on actual data and certain mathematical methods, we use system dynamic software to construct a logic model for THE and changing proportions, and thus simulate the actual conditions of development and changes in THE.
    


          Results:
        
      
      According to the simulation results, the government possess the largest investment in the average annual growth rate of THE, which was 25.16% in 2012. Social investment comprises the majority of the possession ratio, which was up to 41.20%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The personal investment growth rate decreased by almost 21%, but the total amount of personal investment increased by 28075 million yuan, which is far higher than the increase in government investment.

The Swedish welfare state is facing the greatest threat since its inception. Attacks stem from the country's sharp economic downturn since 1989 and the related currency crisis of September 1992. Politicians of the right and left have responded to the economic crisis by initiating cutbacks in social welfare programs and supporting policies that will lead to a massive transfer of income from working people to corporations. The focus on cutting social programs is misplaced. The Swedish economy flourished for decades with the network of social service programs in place; the welfare state cannot be blamed for economic problems that have only recently arisen.,https://doi.org/10.2190/vp4b-6d7l-wb4l-h4db,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8375950/,economics
"Current economic conditions and budget constraints in publicly funded biomedical research have brought about a renewed interest in analyzing the cost and economic viability of research infrastructures. However, there are no proposals for specific cost accounting models for these types of organizations in the international scientific literature. The aim of this paper is to present the basis of a cost analysis model useful for any biobank regardless of the human biological samples that it stores for biomedical research. The development of a unique cost model for biobanks can be a complicated task due to the diversity of the biological samples they store. Different types of samples (DNA, tumor tissues, blood, serum, etc.) require different production processes. Nonetheless, the common basic steps of the production process can be identified. Thus, the costs incurred in each step can be analyzed in detail to provide cost information. Six stages and four cost objects were obtained by taking the production processes of biobanks belonging to the Spanish National Biobank Network as a starting point. Templates and examples are provided to help managers to identify and classify the costs involved in their own biobanks to implement the model. The application of this methodology will provide accurate information on cost objects, along with useful information to give an economic value to the stored samples, to analyze the efficiency of the production process and to evaluate the viability of some sample collections.",https://doi.org/10.1089/bio.2013.0021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24835258/,economics

"Aims:
        
      
      This paper synthesises patient safety research and insights from economic theory to generate guidance for nurse managers. The paper describes the key roles nurses and nurse managers can play in improving patient safety, and explains how insights from health economics can help inform and enhance this role, helping nurse managers to set priorities for improvement and for future research.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Awareness of the need to improve patient safety is high, but insufficient attention has been paid to the cost-effectiveness of safety improvements, leading to difficulty in setting priorities. This paper suggests specific methods that nurses can and should use to prioritize and evaluate safety improvements.
    


          Evaluation:
        
      
      This is a review article, synthesising the results of research on patient safety.
    


          Key issues:
        
      
      Because of their close connection to patients, nurses (and nurse managers in particular) have key roles to play in improving patient safety. Improving patient safety will also benefit nurses and other practitioners directly, because caregivers suffer lasting distress from being involved in incidents that harm patients. Reducing harmful incidents should also reduce attrition and alleviate chronic staffing shortages. Insights from health economics can help nurse managers to set priorities for improvement and to more effectively evaluate the changes made.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Evidence on the costs and effects of most safety improvements is still lacking. Nurses can and should take a leadership role in implementing changes and evaluating their costs and effects.
    


          Implications for nursing management:
        
      
      To lead improvements in patient safety, nurse managers need to learn to use the Plan-Do-Study-Act Improvement Cycle, and need to develop an awareness of and ability to measure the costs and effects of changes. These changes would allow nurse managers to better make the business case for patient safety.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2009.00992.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19416426/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      This paper estimates productivity loss using the health of the patient in order to allow indirect estimation of these costs for inclusion in economic evaluation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from two surveys of inpatients [Health outcomes data repository (HODaR) sample (n = 42,442) and health improvement and patient outcomes (HIPO) sample (n = 6046)] were used. The number of days off paid employment or normal activities (excluding paid employment) was modelled using the health of the patients measured by the EQ-5D, international classification of diseases (ICD) chapters, and other health and sociodemographic data. Two-part models (TPMs) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models were identified as the most appropriate specifications, given large spikes at the minimum and maximum days for the dependent variable. Analysis was undertaken separately for the two datasets to account for differences in recall period and identification of those who were employed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Models were able to reflect the large spike at the minimum (zero days) but not the maximum, with TPMs doing slightly better than the ZINB model. The EQ-5D was negatively associated with days off employment and normal activities in both datasets, but ICD chapters only had statistically significant coefficients for some chapters in the HODaR.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      TPMs can be used to predict productivity loss associated with the health of the patient to inform economic evaluation. Limitations include recall and response bias and identification of who is employed in the HODaR, while the HIPO suffers from a small sample size. Both samples exclude some patient groups.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-017-0326-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28364369/,economics
"This paper reviews the economic case for patents and the potential for differential pricing to increase affordability of on-patent drugs in developing countries while preserving incentives for innovation. Differential pricing, based on Ramsey pricing principles, is the second best efficient way of paying for the global joint costs of pharmaceutical R&D. Assuming demand elasticities are related to income, it would also be consistent with standard norms of equity. To achieve appropriate and sustainable price differences will require either that higher-income countries forego trying to ""import"" low drug prices from low-income countries, through parallel trade and external referencing, or that such practices become less feasible. The most promising approach that would prevent both parallel trade and external referencing is for payers/purchasers on behalf of developing countries to negotiate contracts with companies that include confidential rebates. With confidential rebates, final transactions prices to purchasers can differ across markets while manufacturers sell to distributors at uniform prices, thus eliminating opportunities for parallel trade and external referencing. The option of compulsory licensing of patented products to generic manufacturers may be important if they truly have lower production costs or originators charge prices above marginal cost, despite market separation. However, given the risks inherent in compulsory licensing, it seems best to first try the approach of strengthening market separation, to enable originator firms to maintain differential pricing. With assured market separation, originators may offer prices comparable to the prices that a local generic firm would charge, which eliminates the need for compulsory licensing. Differential pricing could go a long way to improve LDC access to drugs that have a high income market. However, other subsidy mechanisms will be needed to promote R&D for drugs that have no high income market.",https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1025384819575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14625999/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      To describe the economics of teaching hospitals in an increasingly price-conscious managed care marketplace by determining the relationships between a teaching hospital's operations and cost per discharge.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A quantitative correlational regression analysis was undertaken of 1993 operational and financial data from the Health Care Financing Administration for a national sample of 100 major urban, non-federal teaching hospitals. The sample was systematically selected from membership in the Association of American Medical Colleges' Council of Teaching Hospitals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The analysis indicated that the new economics of managed competition requires teaching hospitals to focus on reducing costs through five main areas: decreasing poorly utilized beds, increasing the numbers of discharges, renovating facilities to modernize and streamline patient flow, utilizing fewer employees and thus boosting productivity, and improving the internal financing of operations and investments through working-capital management.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Achieving efficiency in operations in each of the five main areas will help teaching hospitals to survive the turbulence of market evolution toward managed care.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-199611000-00022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9217514/,economics
"In their quest for universal health coverage (UHC), many developing countries use alternative financing strategies including general revenues to expand health coverage to the whole population. Unless a policy adjustment is undertaken, future generations may foot the bill of the UHC. This raises the important policy questions of who bears the burden of UHC and whether the UHC-fiscal stance is sustainable in the long term. These two questions are addressed using an overlapping generations model within a general equilibrium (OLG-CGE) framework applied to Palestine. We assess and compare alternative ways of financing the UHC-ridden deficit (viz. deferred-debt, current and phased-manner finance) and their implications on fiscal sustainability and intergenerational inequalities. The policy instruments examined include direct labour-income tax and indirect consumption taxes as well as health insurance contributions. Results show that in the absence of any policy adjustment, the implementation of UHC would explode the fiscal deficit and debt-GDP ratio. This indicates that the UHC-fiscal stance is rather unsustainable in the long term, thus, calling for a policy adjustment to service the UHC debt. Among the policies we examined, a current rather than deferred-debt finance through consumption taxation emerged to be preferred over other policies in terms of its implications for both fiscal sustainability and intergenerational inequality.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czaa041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32556159/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      There is a gap between health economic evaluation methods and the value judgments of coverage decision makers, at least in Germany. Measuring preference satisfaction has been claimed to be inappropriate for allocating health care resources, e.g. because it disregards medical need. The existing methods oriented at medical need have been claimed to disregard non-consequentialist fairness concerns. The aim of this article is to propose a new, contractarian argument for justifying needs-based economic evaluation. It is based on consent rather than maximization of some impersonal unit of value to accommodate the fairness concerns.
    


          Main text:
        
      
      This conceptual paper draws upon contractarian ethics and constitution economics to show how economic evaluation can be viewed as an institution to overcome societal conflicts in the allocation of scarce health care resources. For this, the problem of allocating scarce health care resources in a society is reconstructed as a social dilemma. Both disadvantaged patients and affluent healthy individuals can be argued to share interests in a societal contract to provide technologies which ameliorate medical need, based on progressive funding. The use of needs-based economic evaluation methods for coverage determination can be interpreted as institutions for conflict resolution as far as they use consented criteria to ensure the social contract's sustainability and avoid implicit rationing or unaffordable contribution rates. This justifies the use of needs-based evaluation methods by Pareto-superiority and consent (rather than by some needs-based value function per se).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The view of economic evaluation presented here may help account for fairness concerns in the further development of evaluation methods. This is because it directs the attention away from determining some unit of value to be maximized towards determining those persons who are most likely not to consent and meeting their concerns. Following this direction in methods development is likely to increase the acceptability of health economic evaluation by decision makers.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-018-0294-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29895268/,economics
"In this Perspective on the preceding paper by Joseph Newhouse, I point out a number of features of the pharmaceutical industry that differentiate it from other health care sectors.

"New Medicare regulations have replaced the cost-based system of reimbursement of capital expenditures by hospitals with a fixed payment per case based on assigned diagnostic-related groups. For the first time, hospitals must pay the governmental share of their capital costs. At the same time, overall reform points toward more capitation or fixed payments from all payers. This article discusses possible responses to legislative and competitive reforms by hospital management and the resulting effectiveness of the changes. To identify the potential effect of capital payment reform, we highlight some of the key provisions and assumptions of the new regulations, discuss the management implications of a changed capital payment system, and explore alternative models of hospital investment behavior in a world where one price for services for all buyers is a probable scenario.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-20-2-303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7636125/,economics
"Little is known about how prospective provider payment affects the provision of services led by unpredictable demand. We investigate hospital responses to a 32% increase in price for two treatments in emergency departments in England in April 2011 using data on 11,532,304 attendances (79 hospitals) between 2009/2010 and 2013/2014. We compare changes in the volumes of these two treatments to a treatment not attracting additional reimbursement using a difference-in-differences framework. Additional reimbursement led to 76% and 152% increases in the volumes of the two incentivised treatments. Hospitals received an additional £64.4 M between April 2011 and March 2014 for providing these treatments, of which 40% (£25.9 M) was attributable to the unanticipated hospital response to the price increase. We use time in treatment to distinguish real increases in treatment from reductions in undercoding or increases in upcoding. The association between the recorded receipt of these treatments and time spent in treatment was the same before and after the price increase, and there was no association between hospital-specific increases in recorded treatment volumes and changes in treatment times. The persistence of the treatment time increment suggests the increase in recorded treatment was a real increase in provision of treatments.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.3890,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237096/,economics

"Most real medical spending growth is accounted for by beneficial but costly new technology. This paper argues that a missing dimension of our concepts of competition among health plans is a focus on their policy toward new technology. In principle, plans could choose to move rapidly or slowly, inclusively or selectively, toward adopting new technologies, broadly defined. These policies would affect the rates of growth of their premiums, and consumers could choose among plans depending on both the technology policy and premium growth. Legal impediments, physician resistance, and membership turnover are all possible obstacles. Further thought should be given to making technology policy an explicit dimension of plan competition.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1523,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16284024/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      In 2003, the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC)-based payment system was introduced on a trial basis in 82 major Japanese hospitals. We analyzed the influence of this system on hospital revenue and expenditure, focusing on whether it reduces the length of stay in hospital (LOS), particularly in the surgical sector.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We studied 120 patients hospitalized at the University of Tokyo hospital between May and July 2003, including 93 surgical patients who underwent operations for gastric, colon, rectal, hepatic, or mammary carcinoma; arteriosclerosis obliterans; appendicitis; adult hernia inguinalis; or varicose veins, and 27 nonsurgical patients hospitalized for recurrent gastric carcinoma, ileus, appendicitis, or mild acute pancreatitis. We analyzed the changes in profit per day in patients with a reduced LOS using the simulation model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Reducing the LOS of the surgical patients resulted in a greater profit; however, there was minimal if any profit increase achieved by reducing the LOS of the medical patients. In fact, when material costs were high, profit decreased.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The DPC-based payment system does not usually offer an economic incentive to shorten the LOS. Expanding our current system will reduce the LOS only in major hospitals, but it will reduce the national average LOS. Thus, the current DPC-based payment system needs to be improved further.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-006-3203-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16794790/,economics

"This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effect of cost-based reimbursement (CBR) on hospital costs and charges. It takes issue with previous analyses which have treated CBR as paying economic costs plus a mark-up, and have concluded that the mark-up is too small to significantly distort hospital decision-making. The basic thesis here is that if reimbursement is based on costs, accounting costs become a price to cost-paying patients, and will be optimized to maximize revenue. A hospital serving both cost and charge-paying (private) patients can set two price schedules. Accounting profits (ratio of charges to costs) are not a measure of economic profit but of relative prices to these two groups of patients. In the absence of constraints from regulation or patient co-payment, the optimum level of accounting costs would be infinite. In practice, the Medicare reimbursement formula links allowable costs to charges received from charge-paying patients. This formula creates incentives for the hospital to raise charges above the single-price, profit-maximizing monopoly level. This inflationary effect of the Medicare formula does not presuppose that Medicare pays less than full cost. The empirical analysis of hospital laboratory costs and charges generally supports the predictions; for other departments, the conclusions are consistent but more tentative because of data limitations. Overall, evidence suggests minimal cross-subsidy between cost and charge-paying patients. Comparisons of cost and charge levels in for-profit, voluntary non-profit and government hospitals are presented, but it is emphasized that inferences about relative efficiency and profitability cannot be drawn from accounting data, given the incentives created by CBR.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6296(82)90020-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10317387/,economics
"Issues of physician ownership and referral could cause major shifts in the structure of medical care and make the financing of U.S. hospital services problematic.

Research findings thus far confirm that physicians' ownership and referral present conflicts of interest through medical and economic patient selection and potentially excessive utilization.

"One of the most prominent features of the Affordable Care Act has been the promotion of individual health plans chosen by consumers in the Marketplaces. These plans are subject to regulation and paid by risk-adjusted capitation, a set of policies known as managed competition. Individual health insurance markets, however, are vulnerable to what economists describe as efficiency problems stemming from adverse selection, and Marketplaces are no exception. Health plans have incentives to discriminate against services used by people with certain chronic illnesses, including mental health conditions. Parity regulations, which dictate coverage for mental health benefits on par with medical and surgical benefits, can eliminate discrimination in coverage but redirect discrimination toward hard-to-regulate tactics from managed care such as restrictive network design and provider payment. This article reviews policy options to contend with ongoing selection issues. ""Better enforcement"" of parity has less chance of success than more fundamental but feasible changes in the way plans are paid or in the way competition among plans is structured.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27269019/,economics
"The 'limited list' or 'formulary' concept has been used to promote rational use of drugs and to set standards for drug use. Recently the concept has been aimed more toward containment of drug costs. Effective hospital formulary systems assist in purchasing and inventory management. Application of the formulary concept has resulted in savings within specific classes of drugs and in total hospital drug costs. Key features which promote effectiveness are development of policies by prescriber consensus and continued education along with feedback on drug usage. The formulary concept also provides a foundation for appropriate use of drugs in hospitals. In the community setting, limited lists can achieve cost savings and can assist in the rational use of drugs. National limited lists have been less successful in controlling overall drug costs, probably because they have focused on economic effects, rather than education, feedback or user participation. Properly organised drug rationalisation policies embracing the limited list concept can improve health outcomes by promoting rational drug use. They can also contain or reduce drug costs.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199201030-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10147029/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Budget impact analyses (BIAs) are an essential part of a comprehensive economic assessment of a health care intervention and are increasingly required by reimbursement authorities as part of a listing or reimbursement submission.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objective of this report was to present updated guidance on methods for those undertaking such analyses or for those reviewing the results of such analyses. This update was needed, in part, because of developments in BIA methods as well as a growing interest, particularly in emerging markets, in matters related to affordability and population health impacts of health care interventions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Task Force was approved by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Health Sciences Policy Council and appointed by its Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of BIAs; worked in academia and industry and as advisors to governments; and came from several countries in North America and South America, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Task Force solicited comments on the drafts from a core group of external reviewers and, more broadly, from the membership of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Task Force recommends that the design of a BIA for a new health care intervention should take into account relevant features of the health care system, possible access restrictions, the anticipated uptake of the new intervention, and the use and effects of the current and new interventions. The key elements of a BIA include estimating the size of the eligible population, the current mix of treatments and the expected mix after the introduction of the new intervention, the cost of the treatment mixes, and any changes expected in condition-related costs. Where possible, the BIA calculations should be performed by using a simple cost calculator approach because of its ease of use for budget holders. In instances, however, in which the changes in eligible population size, disease severity mix, or treatment patterns cannot be credibly captured by using the cost calculator approach, a cohort or patient-level condition-specific model may be used to estimate the budget impact of the new intervention, accounting appropriately for those entering and leaving the eligible population over time. In either case, the BIA should use data that reflect values specific to a particular decision maker's population. Sensitivity analysis should be of alternative scenarios chosen from the perspective of the decision maker. The validation of the model should include at least face validity with decision makers and verification of the calculations. Data sources for the BIA should include published clinical trial estimates and comparator studies for the efficacy and safety of the current and new interventions as well as the decision maker's own population for the other parameter estimates, where possible. Other data sources include the use of published data, well-recognized local or national statistical information, and, in special circumstances, expert opinion. Reporting of the BIA should provide detailed information about the input parameter values and calculations at a level of detail that would allow another modeler to replicate the analysis. The outcomes of the BIA should be presented in the format of interest to health care decision makers. In a computer program, options should be provided for different categories of costs to be included or excluded from the analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We recommend a framework for the BIA, provide guidance on the acquisition and use of data, and offer a common reporting format that will promote standardization and transparency. Adherence to these good research practice principles would not necessarily supersede jurisdiction-specific BIA guidelines but may support and enhance local recommendations or serve as a starting point for payers wishing to promulgate methodology guidelines.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2013.08.2291,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24438712/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Workplace injuries and fatalities in the US create significant economic costs to society. Although economic costs should measure the opportunity cost to society arising from injuries and fatalities, estimating them often proves difficult as a practical matter. This leads to a range of estimates for valuing these costs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This paper compares methods of economic valuation, focusing in particular on how different methods diverge to varying degrees from measuring the ""true"" economic costs of injuries and illnesses. In so doing, it surveys the literature that has arisen in the past 25 years to measure different aspects of economic consequences.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Estimates of the costs of injuries and fatalities tend to understate the true economic costs from a social welfare perspective, particularly in how they account for occupational fatalities and losses arising from work disabilities.

"Objective:
        
      
      The expected value of sample information (EVSI) quantifies the economic benefit of reducing uncertainty in a health economic model by collecting additional information. This has the potential to improve the allocation of research budgets. Despite this, practical EVSI evaluations are limited partly due to the computational cost of estimating this value using the gold-standard nested simulation methods. Recently, however, Heath et al. developed an estimation procedure that reduces the number of simulations required for this gold-standard calculation. Up to this point, this new method has been presented in purely technical terms.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      This study presents the practical application of this new method to aid its implementation. We use a worked example to illustrate the key steps of the EVSI estimation procedure before discussing its optimal implementation using a practical health economic model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The worked example is based on a three-parameter linear health economic model. The more realistic model evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a new chemotherapy treatment, which aims to reduce the number of side effects experienced by patients. We use a Markov model structure to evaluate the health economic profile of experiencing side effects.

      This EVSI estimation method offers accurate estimation within a feasible computation time, seconds compared to days, even for more complex model structures. The EVSI estimation is more accurate if a greater number of nested samples are used, even for a fixed computational cost.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This new method reduces the computational cost of estimating the EVSI by nested simulation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30442277/,economics
"Over the last decade, there has been a proliferation in the number of economic evaluations of pharmaceuticals to meet the growing demand for information about the economic benefits of healthcare technologies. The majority of these studies have been commissioned by pharmaceutical companies for the purposes of drawing attention to the resource and quality-of-life aspects of new or existing products. Such information has become important in overcoming a new obstacle, namely the demonstration of cost effectiveness (the so-called 'fourth hurdle'), in addition to the three well-established criteria of quality, tolerability and efficacy. To ensure the maintenance of standards, guidance for economic evaluations has emerged lately in the form of guidelines, regulations, principles, policies and positions. Drummond outlined three purposes of these guidelines, as follows: as a requirement prior to reimbursement, as statements of methodological standards, and as a statement of ethical standards. Such guidelines are designed to assist both the economic analyst and the decision-maker. In laying out the state of the art regarding the methodology of economic evaluation, guidelines assist the analyst in performing high-quality, scientifically valid studies, and assist the decision-maker in properly interpreting and assessing their quality. In response to these growing requirements for cost-effectiveness data globally, it has become increasingly common for economic evaluations to be conducted on an international scale. However, the recommendations in pharmacoeconomics guidelines regarding the manner in which these multinational economic evaluations should be designed, analysed and presented are too limited to be of any real value. This article examines the various issues that must be taken into consideration when conducting multinational studies, and provides a review of the techniques and approaches that have been suggested to date. It concludes with recommendations for potential inclusion in future sets of pharmacoeconomic guidelines.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200220020-00001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11888360/,economics
"Paying insurers risk-adjusted prices for covering different individuals can correct selection incentives and induce the market to provide optimal insurance policies. To calculate the optimal risk-adjusted prices we need to know (a) what the optimal policies are; (b) how much they cost; and (c) how competitive the market is. We examine these issues in a model with spatial heterogeneity and adverse selection. Market equilibrium is characterized, and delivery of the socially optimal insurance policies is possible, as long as providers are paid risk-adjusted fees for each individual they serve. When the payment can be made on the basis of an individual's risk, it should be sufficient to cover the expected cost of the socially optimal policy for that person, plus a mark-up. If payments can be made only on the basis of a partially informative signal, the optimal risk-based payments should be adjusted according to a simple linear transformation, identified by Glazer and McGuire [Glazer, J., McGuire, T., 2000. Optimal risk adjustment of health insurance premiums: an application to managed care.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.01.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16712986/,economics
"While the distinct behaviors of for-profit and non-profit providers in the healthcare market have been compared in the economic literature, their choices regarding market entry and exit have only recently been debated. Since 2000, when public Long-Term Care Insurance was introduced in Japan, for-profit providers have been able to provide formal long-term homecare services. The aim of this study is to determine which factors have affected market entry of for-profit providers under price regulation and in competition with existing non-profit providers. We used nation-wide panel data from 2002 to 2010, aggregated at the level of local public insurers (n = 1557), a basic area unit of service provision. The number of for-profit providers per elderly population in the area unit was regressed against factors related to local demand and service costs using first-difference linear regression, a fixed effects model, and Tobit regression for robustness checking. Results showed that demand (the number of eligible care recipients) and cost factors (population density and minimum wage) significantly influenced for-profit providers' choice of market entry. These findings indicate that for-profit providers will strategically choose a local market for maximizing profit. We believe that price regulation should be redesigned to incorporate quality of care and market conditions, regardless of the profit status of the providers, to ensure equal access to efficient delivery of long-term care across all regions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.10.018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23182594/,economics

"Public health and the environment are the most essential pillars, and play a vital role in the economy. In order to better public health, the economic and environmental atmosphere must be stable and clean, respectively. Thus, this paper emphasizes on nexus between economic, public health, and the environment. Therefore, the objective of this paper is whether healthcare and environmental expenditures affect economic efficiency and vice versa. So, this study evaluates the performance of the country's economic efficiency and investigates the effect of healthcare and environmental expenditures for 62 Belt and Road Initiative countries for the period from 1996 to 2020. Suitable input-output variables are employed under the framework of DEA-window and Malmquist Index Productivity, and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). In addition, this study estimates the relationship between economic efficiency, healthcare, and environmental expenditures by fixed and random effects models. Therefore, the analytical outcomes reveal that countries are economically efficient. On the contrary, SFA estimation concludes that countries are found to be inefficient, because higher variation is exists in efficiency change compared to technological efficiency change and total factor productivity change on average. In addition, it is worth notable that healthcare and environmental expenditures improve the country's economic efficiency. Furthermore, public health is also influenced by economic efficiency. Thus, this study suggests that countries should better utilize given resources and invest a specific portion of national income in order to improve economic efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.842070,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35223748/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      We investigated the relationship between the number of generic medicines and pharmaceutical prices over time in Australia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A dataset was utilised containing 76 items for 4 years (2003-2007) on the national subsidy scheme - the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) - for which a generic brand is available. The PBS price was used as the dependent variable, and the number of generics available the key explanatory variable. The ordinary least-squares estimator was adopted for estimation. In the robustness analysis, an instrumental-variables method was used to account for potential endogeneity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results suggested that the effect of increased generic medicine sellers on reducing the prices paid for generics is marginal but statistically significant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is suggested that structural changes to the way generic prices are determined needs to be reconsidered by the Australian government if the policy aim of using increased 'competition' to lower prices is to be maximised.",https://doi.org/10.1071/ah13024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24160374/,economics
"Pharmaceutical policy in Italy has been reshaped as a result of the 1993-4 crisis in which it was revealed that pharmaceutical companies, policy makers and top Department of Health officers had constructed an illegal system to set prices. Following this crisis, the rise of technical competency and leadership in the Italian Department of Health and, since 2000, in the Drug Regulatory Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco; AIFA) has achieved major improvements in many aspects of Italian pharmaceutical policy. These improvements have included increased transparency of decision making, the use of evidence-based medicine principles for reimbursement and pricing, and the use of generic drugs to lower prices.As a result of these changes, pharmaceutical expenditure has been controlled and equity has improved, mainly because co-payments have been reduced, thus reducing private expenditure on reimbursable drugs. However, a short-term approach to cost containment has prevailed, and Italian pharmaceutical policy has neglected industrial parameters. Hence, the trend in pharmaceutical expenditure has been erratic, and Italy has not favoured localization of research and development and production in its territory. The dominant issue of Italian health policy in recent years has been devolution of powers to regions, the intermediate tier of the Italian State. Overall, devolution has increased regional accountability on healthcare spending. However, regions react to enhanced freedom in different ways, reflecting their institutional capacity and competencies. This process has also affected pharmaceutical policy, more than in other decentralized healthcare systems (such as Germany and Spain). Such a situation is causing increasing regional variations and geographical equity concerns. In addition, the regional level appears rather inadequate to promote an industrial perspective unless it is supported by national initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200826010-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18088155/,economics
"To facilitate the comparison of different treatment strategies, measures have been developed that bring together clinical, quality-of-life, and economic outcomes into summary measures such as the quality-adjusted life year, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility ratios. A number of different types of economic evaluations have been developed, including cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analyses. Performance of economic analyses in association with randomized, controlled trials (RCT) has gained increasing enthusiasm in recent years. However, economic measures in RCTs are often outcomes of secondary interest and associated with frequent missing data and inadequate sample size. Variability in the cost measures used and the lack of agreement on clinically meaningful cost differences further limit the conclusions derived from such studies. Economic analyses should be limited to large trials with important trade-offs between efficacy and cost. The strengths and limitations of such analyses are discussed, and guidelines are offered for proper economic analyses in randomized, controlled trials.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11912-001-0025-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11489239/,economics
"Denmark, Finland and Sweden have experienced two major recessions during the last 25 years. The adjustments to the earlier crisis in the late 1980s (Denmark) and early 1990s (Finland and Sweden) resembled the policies in many other European countries during the present crisis. The analysis of relationship of deep economic crises and growth period between them to the health system policies and institutions in the three countries from the 1980s to 2013 is based on a categorisation of reactions to external shocks as path conforming or path breaking. The results of the empirical long-term trends show that the reactions to deep recessions have been mainly temporary adjustments and acceleration of changes already prepared before economic crisis. The economic crisis in the three countries has not been 'good enough' to enable paradigmatic changes in the Nordic public, decentralised and equity-oriented health systems. Changes such as the slow privatisation in care funding and production and the adoption of new management practices indicate an ongoing paradigmatic change related to longer-term societal, ideological and political developments rather than directly to economic crises or growth.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133114000243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25662197/,economics
"In order to encourage performance improvements, the English government has set targets for acute hospitals to reduce their unit costs. Targets are based on analysis of costs across all acute hospitals. This policy has parallels with that of 'yardstick competition', advocated as a means to encourage efficiency in industries that lack competitive pressures. However, the prospect of cost improvements may not be realised in England. Firstly, there are insufficient incentives to respond appropriately to the provision of comparative cost information. Secondly, there is more than one index purporting to measure relative hospital costs. As comparison of unit costs is highly dependent on the measurement technique adopted, caution should be exercised when setting performance targets.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(01)00133-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11459629/,economics
"Many immunization strategies have been proposed to prevent infectious viruses from spreading through a network. In this work, we study efficient immunization strategies to prevent a default contagion that might occur in a financial network. An essential difference from the previous studies on immunization strategy is that we take into account the possibility of serious side effects. Uniform immunization refers to a situation in which banks are ""vaccinated"" with a common low-risk asset. The riskiness of immunized banks will decrease significantly, but the level of systemic risk may increase due to the de-diversification effect. To overcome this side effect, we propose another immunization strategy, called counteractive immunization, which prevents pairs of banks from failing simultaneously. We find that counteractive immunization can efficiently reduce systemic risk without altering the riskiness of individual banks.",https://doi.org/10.1038/srep03834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24452277/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      Although awareness is increasing that cancer can have an adverse financial and economic impact for patients, the overall burden remains poorly understood. To elucidate these issues, we used qualitative methods to explore the financial impact of a cancer diagnosis in Ireland, which has a mixed public-private healthcare system and where sick leave and sick pay are at employers' discretion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with hospital-based oncology social workers (OSWs; 21 OSWs from 11 hospitals) and patients (20 from eight hospitals; 11 breast, 5 prostate and 4 lung cancer). Participants were asked about the (1) extra expenses incurred, (2) cancer's impact on work and income, and (3) accessing financial assistance/social welfare benefits. The two interview sets were analysed separately using thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Broad themes that emerged included the wide range of additional cancer-related medical and non-medical expenses incurred by all patients, including those with medical cards (which entitle the bearer to receive health services free of charge) and those with private health insurance; the major impact of cancer and its treatment on work and patient/household income (all patients who were working at diagnosis experienced a drop in income); and difficulties in accessing medical cards and benefits.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study reveals the complex, multidimensional nature of the financial and economic burden cancer imposes on patients and the whole family unit. Changes in income post-cancer exacerbate the effects of cancer-related out-of-pocket expenses.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To analyze whether the adoption of a societal perspective would alter the results and conclusions of economic evaluations for rare disease-related healthcare technologies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A search strategy involving all the active substances considered as orphan drugs by the European Medicines Agency plus a list of 76 rare diseases combined with economic-related terms was conducted on Medline and the Cost-Effectiveness Registry from the beginning of 2000 until November 2018. We included studies that considered quality-adjusted life years as an outcome, were published in a scientific journal, were written in English, included informal care costs or productivity losses, and separated the results according to the applied perspective.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found 14 articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Productivity losses were considered in 12 studies, the human capital approach being the method most frequently used. Exclusively, informal care was considered in 2 articles, being valued through the opportunity cost method. The 14 articles selected resulted in 26 economic evaluation estimations, from which incremental cost-utility ratio values changed from cost-effective to dominant in 3 estimates, but the consideration of societal costs only modified the authors' conclusion in 1 study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The presence of societal costs in the economic evaluation of rare diseases did not affect the conclusions of the studies except in a single specific case. In those studies where the societal perspective was considered, we did not find significant changes in the economic evaluation results due to the higher costs of treatments and the low quality-adjusted life-years gained.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33641778/,economics
"A deterministic bio-economic model was developed and applied to evaluate biological and economic variables that characterize smallholder pig production systems in Kenya. Two pig production systems were considered namely, semi-intensive (SI) and extensive (EX). The input variables were categorized into biological variables including production and functional traits, nutritional variables, management variables and economic variables. The model factored the various sow physiological systems including gestation, farrowing, lactation, growth and development. The model was developed to evaluate a farrow to finish operation, but the results were customized to account for a farrow to weaner operation for a comparative analysis. The operations were defined as semi-intensive farrow to finish (SIFF), semi-intensive farrow to weaner (SIFW), extensive farrow to finish (EXFF) and extensive farrow to weaner (EXFW). In SI, the profits were the highest at KES. 74,268.20 per sow per year for SIFF against KES. 4026.12 for SIFW. The corresponding profits for EX were KES. 925.25 and KES. 626.73. Feed costs contributed the major part of the total costs accounting for 67.0, 50.7, 60.5 and 44.5 % in the SIFF, SIFW, EXFF and EXFW operations, respectively.

"Treatment of cancer in childhood is an expensive undertaking for the health-care system and for the affected families. As there is a substantial burden of treatment-related morbidity, it is important to determine whether the effects of treatment are worth these monetary costs, especially from a societal perspective. Economic evaluation affords a comparison of the costs and consequences (effects) of relevant therapeutic alternatives. Preference-based measures of health-related quality of life are particularly useful for assessing the effects of treatment, for these tools integrate mortality and morbidity. These measures provide utility scores that can be used as weights on survival data to compute quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs are incurred both within and outside of the health-care system. The former should include those in front-line patient care departments (e.g. nursing); the pro-rated share of the expenses of service departments (e.g. materials management) to those in the front line; and the fully allocated costs for capital invested in lands, building and equipment. The latter are costs borne by families that are both out-of-pocket (e.g. for over-the-counter drugs) as well as related to time spent in providing care, which may involve foregone income. Costs and consequences should be subject to discounting; a process for converting those items incurred in the future into contemporary equivalents. Economic evaluation provides estimates of incremental discounted costs per discounted QALY gained. By almost any interpretative standard this appears attractive with respect to cancer in childhood. Examples are provided with the encouragement that economic evaluation be undertaken in more clinical trials in paediatric oncology.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2004.01.033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15177493/,economics
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Use of budget-based payment methodologies (capitation and episode-based bundled payment) has been demonstrated to drive value in healthcare delivery. With a focus on high-volume, high-cost surgical procedures, inclusion of anaesthesiology services in these methodologies is likely. This review provides a summary of budget-based payment methodologies and practical information necessary for anaesthesiologists to prepare for participation in these programmes.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Although few examples of anaesthesiologists' participation in these models exist, an understanding of the structure of these programmes and opportunities for participation are available. Prospective preparation in developing anaesthesiology-specific bundled payment profiles and early participation in pathway development associated with selected episodes of care are essential for successful participation as a gainsharing partner.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      With significant opportunity to contribute to care coordination and cost management, anaesthesiology can play an important role in budget-based payment programmes and should expect to participate as full gainsharing partners. Precise costing methodologies and accurate economic modelling, along with identification of quality management and cost control opportunities, will help identify participation opportunities and appropriate payment and gainsharing agreements. Anaesthesiology-specific examples with budget-based payment models are needed to help guide increased participation in these programmes.",https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000239,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26308510/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Patients with palliative care needs do not access specialist palliative care services according to their needs. Clinical Nurse Specialists working across a variety of fields are playing an increasingly important role in the care of such patients, but there is limited knowledge of the extent to which their interventions are cost-effective.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To present results from a systematic review of the international evidence on the costs, resource use and cost-effectiveness of Clinical Nurse Specialist-led interventions for patients with palliative care needs, defined as seriously ill patients and those with advanced disease or frailty who are unlikely to be cured, recover or stabilize.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Systematic review following PRISMA methodology.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library up to 2015. Studies focusing on the outcomes of Clinical Nurse Specialist interventions for patients with palliative care needs, and including at least one economic outcome, were considered. The quality of studies was assessed using tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute.

      Clinical Nurse Specialist interventions may be effective in reducing specific resource use such as hospitalizations/re-hospitalizations/admissions, length of stay and health care costs. There is mixed evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. Future studies should ensure that Clinical Nurse Specialists' roles and activities are clearly described and evaluated.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216317711570,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28655289/,economics
"Although choledochoscopy for the prevention of retained bile duct stones has been postulated as cost effective, no economic evaluation exists to substantiate this claim. We performed a cost-minimization analysis on 287 patients who underwent choledochoscopy during operations for biliary tract calculi between 1981 and 1987 to assess the economic impact of choledochoscopy versus noncholedochoscopic alternatives in obtaining a stone-free duct. Common duct exploration was positive for calculi in 75% of patients. Choledochoscopy-detected residual stones after duct exploration in 10% of patients. Residual stones were more frequent after positive (12.5%) than negative (2.7%) duct explorations. retained stones occurred in 4.5% of patients after operation. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values of choledochoscopy were 67%, 100%, and 95%, respectively. Cost-minimization analysis showed that total cost of either selective ($75,250) or routine ($110,450) choledochoscopy significantly exceeded the total cost of obtaining a stone-free duct for patients with retained stones via either extraction through a T-tube tract ($17,545) or by endoscopic papillotomy ($45,675). Because choledochoscopy was not economically competitive with noncholedochoscopic, nonoperative alternatives, reduction of choledochoscopy fees was implemented to economically justify continued use of choledochoscopy. We conclude that choledochoscopy is clinically efficacious in obtaining a stone-free duct, but endorsement of either routine or selective choledochoscopy by cost-minimization analysis requires careful assessment of fee structure to make choledochoscopy competitive economically.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00000658-199003000-00007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2106842/,economics

      To examine the effects of parallel simvastatin importation on drug price in three of the main parallel importing countries in the European Union, namely the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To estimate the market share of parallel imported simvastatin and the unit price -both locally produced and parallel imported- adjusted by defined daily dose in the importing country and in the exporting country (Spain). Ordinary least squares regression was used to examine the potential price competition resulting from parallel drug trade between 1997 and 2002.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The market share of parallel imported simvastatin progressively expanded (especially in the United Kingdom and Germany) in the period examined, although the price difference between parallel imported and locally sourced simvastatin was not significant. Prices tended to rise in the United Kingdom and Germany and declined in the Netherlands. We found no evidence of pro-competitive effects resulting from the expansion of parallel trade.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The development of parallel drug importation in the European Union produced unexpected effects (limited competition) on prices that differ from those expected by the introduction of a new competitor. This is partially the result of drug price regulation scant incentives to competition and of the lack of transparency in the drug reimbursement system, especially due to the effect of informal discounts (not observable to researchers). The case of simvastatin reveals that savings to the health system from parallel trade are trivial. Finally, of the three countries examined, the only country that shows a moderate downward pattern in simvastatin prices is the Netherlands. This effect can be attributed to the existence of a system that claws back informal discounts.",https://doi.org/10.1157/13099121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17306187/,economics
"Political analysis can enrich our understanding of the interface between health and society. Here, a theoretical framework called 'the biomarket' is proposed, one that describes the interaction between life, power and the market, and the progressive institutionalisation of this dynamic by state actors. This framework expands upon 'biopower', a social concept developed by Michel Foucault. The role of the biomarket is illustrated by analysis of a range of cases, namely the relationships between global health and the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries. The potential adverse consequences of the biomarket are demonstrated, revealing how in some instances, important social measures of welfare are discarded for the sake of economic efficiency and profit. The authors conclude that the biomarket may serve to deepen our understanding of the authority and control exerted by corporations over life, positing that the biomarket must be further regulated for sustainable advances in global health.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2012.758300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23311637/,economics
"Rationale:
        
      
      The health economy is a significant part of a national economy accounting typically for about 8% of GDP spent. As national economies respond to the dual challenges of severe economic turbulence on the global scale and climate change mitigation, the health economy is coming under increasing pressure to respond. Indications for sharp reductions in budgets and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, are widespread.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      In this paper an analysis is undertaken of the diverse forces acting on a typical health care enterprise. The forces, both economic and carbon related, are investigated in terms of their effects through the enterprise and across its boundaries on the supply, demand and waste sides. The overall aim is to show how the enterprise and whole supply chains may flip synchronously into a low-carbon evolutionary pathway.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      By illustrating how different elements of the health care enterprise may respond to these developments, diverse opportunities for cost reduction, carbon reduction and product (goods and services) development are identified. These opportunities involve a variety of waste reduction and energy and materials conservation measures as well as new ways of collaborating with other enterprises going through similar transformations. The overall objective is to show that the carbon-constrained health care enterprise and the low-carbon health economy in which it sits may broaden its role in the coming decades to include a degree of responsibility for the health of the environment. This broader role is likely to supplement and entangle with the traditional role of the health economy, currently focused narrowly on human health, and lead to extensive organisational transformation, and infrastructure and product developments.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01356.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367839/,economics
"In health economic evaluations, value added tax is commonly treated as a transfer payment. Following this argument, resources are valued equal to their net-of-tax prices in economic evaluations applying a societal perspective. In this article we argue that if there is the possibility that a new healthcare intervention may expand the healthcare budget, the social cost of input factors should be the gross-of-tax prices and not the net-of-tax prices. The rising interest in cost-benefit analysis and the use of absolute thresholds, net benefit estimates and acceptability curves in cost-effectiveness analysis makes this argument highly relevant for an appropriate use of these tools in prioritisation.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00148365-200605040-00003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17249838/,economics
"Introduction: Economic topics appear in the medical studies curriculum at different times. Despite socio-political relevance, there is hardly any information about the degree of understanding that medical students have of ""economics in medicine"". The present study addresses the questions: What understanding of ""economics in medicine"" do medical students have before the start of the Practical Year? To what extent is economic teaching content understood as ""economization"" from outside the profession? Method: Magdeburg medical students in the 5th year of study, who participated in preparatory seminars for the Practical Year (PY) in 2014 and 2015 (60 participants each), assessed the relevance of various seminar topics four months prior to the start of the semester. On the basis of a three-stage qualitative-reconstructive partial evaluation, students' economic understanding is explored through secondary analysis: deductive derivation of the analysis units; integrative basic method (""segmentation"", ""micro-linguistic detailed analysis"", ""central theme""); development of a theoretical model by placing the central themes in context following Grounded Theory. Results: Based on the theory, 19 free-text answers with economic reference were identified from the total of all free-text answers. Each answer was assigned to at least one of a total of six themes of the students' understanding of economics: de-professionalizing economization, deciding and working economically, ambivalent requirements for efficiency and equity, the doctor as an entrepreneur, economics as relevant learning content, PY as a conflict-laden setting for economized working and learning. The theoretical model contains social, praxeological and professional references, which can themselves be ambivalent and conflicting. Conclusion: Despite their critical attitude, the surveyed medical students are neither hostile to economics nor do they regard economics in medicine as a taboo subject. Economic learning content is recognized as relevant. Educational formats that tackle the tension between patient and system orientation in a problem-oriented manner can be a productive setting for economic reflection.",https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001249,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31544141/,economics

"We build a nonlinear dynamic model with currency, demand deposits and bank reserves. Monetary base is controlled by central bank, while money supply is determined by the interactions between central bank, commercial banks and public.

"The need to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions has led to a rapid increase in the use of economic tools within pharmaceutical evaluations. Pharmacoeconomics is employed at many stages of the evaluation process, helping to predict which products are likely to be economically viable at an early stage, and providing information to aid price and reimbursement negotiations as well as formulary and purchasing decisions in conjunction with phase III and IV clinical trials. The ability of economic evaluations to accurately determine the best use of society's scarce resources, however, is strongly influenced by the existence of areas of confusion, controversy and dispute which hinder the researcher at every step. A good economic evaluation requires a number of ingredients including: (i) relevant, good quality clinical data, raising issues of trial design, sample size and perspective; (ii) relevant costs and outcomes, measured, valued and discounted credibly and accurately; (iii) appropriate methods of data analysis (statistical, incremental and sensitivity); and, once the trial is over, (iv) presentation of the results in a way which maximises the generalisability of the results and, hence, the usefulness of the research.

"During and immediately after the recent recession, national health expenditures grew exceptionally slowly. During 2009-11 per capita national health spending grew about 3 percent annually, compared to an average of 5.9 percent annually during the previous ten years. Policy experts disagree about whether the slower health spending growth was temporary or represented a long-term shift. This study examined two factors that might account for the slowdown: job loss and benefit changes that shifted more costs to insured people. Based on an examination of data covering more than ten million enrollees with health care coverage from large firms in 2007-11, we found that these enrollees' out-of-pocket costs increased as the benefit design of their employer-provided coverage became less generous in this period. We conclude that such benefit design changes accounted for about one-fifth of the observed decrease in the rate of growth. However, we also observed a slowdown in spending growth even when we held benefit generosity constant, which suggests that other factors, such as a reduction in the rate of introduction of new technology, were also at work. Our findings suggest cautious optimism that the slowdown in the growth of health spending may persist--a change that, if borne out, could have a major impact on US health spending projections and fiscal challenges facing the country.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1297,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650315/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Typically, little consideration is given to the allocation of indirect costs (overheads and capital) to hospital services, compared to the allocation of direct costs. Weighted service allocation is believed to provide the most accurate indirect cost estimation, but the method is time consuming.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether hourly rate, inpatient day, and marginal mark-up allocation are reliable alternatives for weighted service allocation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The cost approaches were compared independently for appendectomy, hip replacement, cataract, and stroke in representative general hospitals in The Netherlands for 2005.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Hourly rate allocation and inpatient day allocation produce estimates that are not significantly different from weighted service allocation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Hourly rate allocation may be a strong alternative to weighted service allocation for hospital services with a relatively short inpatient stay. The use of inpatient day allocation would likely most closely reflect the indirect cost estimates obtained by the weighted service method.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00475.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19138307/,economics
"Traditional ideas of science as being separate and separable from ideology and politics have to be reconsidered. Each interpretation of sustainable development is not only scientific but at the same time ideological. For this reason our ideas about good science should also be related to normal imperatives of democracy. Mainstream neoclassical economics is specific in scientific and ideological terms. This paradigm is useful for some purposes and has played a role as a mental map in guiding us towards economic growth and other ideas about progress in society and the economy. Sustainable development, however, represents an ideological turn in our ideas about progress and it is no longer clear that neoclassical theory will be enough. Alternative perspectives in economics are being developed as part of a pluralistic strategy and the monopoly position of neoclassical economists at university departments of economics is thereby challenged. A 'political economic person' is suggested as alternative (complement) to Economic Man assumptions and a 'political economic organization' to be compared with the neoclassical profit maximizing firm. Alternative ways of understanding markets and international trade, efficiency, decision-making, monitoring and assessment are also needed. It is argued that such an alternative mental map is useful for actors who take the challenge of sustainable development seriously.",https://doi.org/10.1039/b811379n,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19037489/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      Gout is a painful and disabling joint disease that constitutes the most common inflammatory arthritis in the US. To clarify the economic impact of gout, we systematically reviewed the literature on the direct and indirect costs associated with this disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, NHS Economic Evaluation, and CINAHL databases to identify studies of gout and economics. We systematically reviewed published studies that met our inclusion criteria and extracted and summarized all relevant economic parameters. Reported costs were inflation-adjusted to 2013 US dollars (USD).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 15 studies met all eligibility criteria. Three controlled studies reported all-cause total direct costs based on specific populations (i.e., $4733, $16,925, and $18,362 per capita among employed, elderly, and treatment-refractory gout populations, respectively, and $2562, $10,590, and $7188 among corresponding non-gout patients). Two additional studies, although uncontrolled, allowed for estimation of total all-cause direct costs in unselected gout populations ($11,080 and $13,170). Gout-related costs ranged from $172 to $6179, depending on population characteristics. Six studies reported positive associations of direct costs with SUA level, gout attack frequency, or presence of tophi. Four studies reported on indirect costs, which were estimated to be as high as $4341 USD.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The available data suggest that gout patients incur substantially greater direct and indirect costs as compared with gout-free individuals among elderly and treatment-refractory gouty patients, whereas the costs are considerably less among younger, employed gouty patients. Further, direct costs increased with worsening disease characteristics.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2015.02.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25912932/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      This paper surveys the effects of day-based lump-sum remuneration as defined by the PEPP system on the patients' length of stay and compares its incentives to the mechanisms of the German DRG system and the former remunera-tion system for stationary psychiatric and psychosomatic treatments.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The analysis identifies the economically optimal length of stay defined as the profit maximising duration of treatment by comparing marginal revenues and marginal costs. Since it is economically optimal to extend the treatment until the marginal costs exceed the marginal revenues, psychiatric and psychosomatic facilities are incentivised to minimise the time gap between average duration of treatment as expected duration of treatment and the economically optimal length of stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared to the German DRG system, which provides a strong incentive to reduce length of stay, the incentives set by the PEPP system imply either a reduction or an extension of treatment duration depending on the underlying cost function. If a degressive cost function is assumed, which is typical for treatments of psychiatric and psychosomatic illnesses, the economically optimal duration of treatment will be at the last upper boundary of the interval of the marginal revenue function in which the average marginal revenues exceed the average marginal costs. It is also feasible that it is economically optimal to treat the patient for as long as possible. The hospital is incentivised to extend or reduce the time of treatment to this point in time.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Psychiatric and psychosomatic hospitals are able to increase their profits by reducing or extending time of treatment. Therefore these facilities have to justify the extent of treatment to the health insurance companies. Since the incentives of the PEPP system and the DRG system diverge, the results of research on supply induced demand in the DRG system cannot be transferred to the discussion about the effects of the introduction of the PEPP system. As long as the average duration of treatment as expected duration of treatment deviates from the economically optimal length of stay, policy makers should consider the options of adaptations, i. e., increase of time intervals or calculating cost weights based on variable costs combined with separate remuneration of fixed costs. The TEPP system and PEPPplus are already being discussed as adaptions or additions.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1374618,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24937352/,economics

"The development of managed care is described as an unexpected product of competition between public and private purchasers of health care. Managed care is a series of purchasing techniques that employers have applied to reduce the cost of their employees' health benefits. Its most significant use has been as a device for bargaining with individual health care providers by encouraging or requiring employees to purchase health care services from a select set of providers. Selective contracting has broken a 40-year-old barrier to price competition among health care providers, who have responded to this negotiating tactic by forming or joining larger organizational units to strengthen their bargaining power. Although the so-called managed care revolution has reduced the rate of increase in health care costs by creating a more competitive price environment, it is simply a start toward a more effective health care market. It is very much a work in progress that will affect and be affected by both political and market changes occurring over the remainder of this century.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.277.7.560,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9032163/,economics
"The novel finding of Balakrishnan, Miller & Shankar (2008) that investors, overwhelmed by the plethora of stock investment offerings, limit their analysis and daily choices to only a small subset of stocks (i.e., herding behavior) now seems to be common wisdom (Iosebashvili, 2019). We investigate whether the introduction of an innovation in financial products designed to allow investors to trade the entire product bundle of S&P 500 stocks, namely S&P 500 index funds, altered ""herding behavior"" by creating a new class of index investors. We model the distribution of daily trading concentration as a power law function and examine changes over the last six decades. Intriguingly, we discover a unique pattern in the trading concentration distribution that exhibits two distinct trends. For the period 1960-75, the trading concentration of the S&P 500 stocks tracks the increasing trend for the entire market, i.e., the unevenness in trading has steadily increased. However, after the introduction of S&P 500 index funds in 1975, concentration of trading in the S&P 500 stocks has steadily decreased, i.e., trading distribution has become more even across all 500 stocks, contrary to the current belief of equity analysts. This is also in sharp contrast to the case of U.S. stocks that are not in the S&P 500 index where trading concentration has steadily increased. We further corroborate the uniqueness of the inverted V-shape by a counterfactual investigation of the trading concentration patterns for other sets of 500 stock portfolios. This uniquely distinctive trading concentration pattern for S&P 500 stocks appears to be driven by the increasing dominance of bundle trading by index investors.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230393,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32208426/,economics
"To face the economic pressures arising from the current socio-economic conjuncture, hospital laboratories are endangered by an increasing trend towards the outsourcing of clinical laboratory tests to external (mega-) laboratories. This should allow hospitals to meet their economic requirements, but with an increased risk of loss of medical quality and, mid- to long-term, loss of cost effectiveness of healthcare at the national level. To anticipate current developments (economical and technological) that inevitably will affect the future of laboratory medicine, hospital laboratories should be proactive and enhance efficiency, reduce costs by consolidation, integrate into regional networks, and form alliances or partnerships. To create additional value, the core competency of laboratory professionals must be refocused to provide medical knowledge services (consultative support to clinicians) related to in vitro diagnostic testing. To integrate cost-efficiency with medical quality, implementation of a matricial organization - operational vs. biomedical level - could be an interesting approach.

"The point of departure of this Editorial is the fact that we all are engaged in self-rationing in our everyday lives. We would like to spend more money on all sorts of nice things and devote more time to our cherished activities. Imposed rationing is characteristic of wartime governments, who seek to prevent the rich from gobbling up the resources left by the army. Since the publication in 1987 of David Callahan's Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society (Callahan, Setting limits: medical goals in an aging society, Simon & Schuster, New York, 1987), rationing of health care has become a widely debated issue (the Internet is full of pertinent entries). While rationing has also been addressed by health economists, there are three puzzling observations. First, Callahan (Callahan, Setting limits: medical goals in an aging society, Simon & Schuster, New York, 1987) wrote for an American audience whereas rationing was introduced by the British National Health Service (NHS) well before 1987, with little debate. Second, the economic theory of rationing had been laid out by James Tobin [Ectrica 20(4): 521-533, 1952] as early as 1952--but health economists seem to have neglected his groundwork when writing about rationing. Third, they accept government-imposed rationing as inevitable in the case of health care, as though the self-rationing alternative was unavailable.

"Purpose:
        
      
      In 2015 the remuneration system for psychiatric and psychosomatic stationary treatments will be revised. The remuneration for a case is calculated by the product of base rate, a cost weight and the number of days of treatment. The cost weight varies depending on the number of days of treatment. This paper surveys the incentives, the casemix structure and the consistency of the modified PEPP system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Under the assumption of a profit-maximising supplier it is possible to define the economically optimal length of stay by comparing marginal revenues and marginal costs. Therefore a revenue function is derived from the new structure of the PEPP system. Since the determination of the marginal revenues is not mathematically possible, the revenues per additional day of treatment are calculated. On that basis it is possible to determine the economically optimal length of stay and to assess the consistency of the system changes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In an early stage of treatment the revenues per additional day of treatment are degressive. After a defined amount of days these additional revenues stay constant, which will be relevant for the majority of the cases. It is economically optimal for the hospitals to treat patients as long as possible, if the marginal costs lie or sink below these constant revenues per additional day of treatment. Furthermore the system changes result in a more complex casemix structure and the calculation of the cost weights is partially inconsistent, since the marginal revenues do not monotonically decrease.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The modifications lead to a reduction of degressive elements in the PEPP system, which might also be accompanied by a decrease of economically induced pressure on length of stay. The inconsistent calculation of the cost weights and the more complicated casemix structure can be viewed critically.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1548850,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26335654/,economics
"We focus on automatic strategies to optimize life cycle savings and investment. Classical optimal savings theory establishes that, given the level of risk aversion, a saver would keep the same relative amount invested in risky assets at any given time. We show that, when optimizing lifecycle investment, performance and risk assessment have to take into account the investor's risk aversion and the maximum amount the investor could lose, simultaneously. When risk aversion and maximum possible loss are considered jointly, an optimal savings strategy is obtained, which follows from constant rather than relative absolute risk aversion. This result is fundamental to prove that if risk aversion and the maximum possible loss are both high, then holding a constant amount invested in the risky asset is optimal for a standard lifetime saving/pension process and outperforms some other simple strategies. Performance comparisons are based on downside risk-adjusted equivalence that is used in our illustration.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/510531,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24711728/,economics

"With Medicare spending projected to increase to 24 percent of all federal spending and to equal 6 percent of the gross domestic product by 2037, policy makers are again considering ways to curb the program's spending growth.

We found that the scenarios would lead to reductions in cumulative Medicare spending in 2012-36 of 2.4-24.0 percent. However, the scenarios also would increase out-of-pocket spending for enrollees and, in some cases, cause millions of seniors not to enroll in the program and to be left without coverage. To achieve substantial cost savings without causing substantial lack of coverage among seniors, policy makers should consider benefit changes in combination with other options, such as some of those now being contemplated by the Obama administration and Congress.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650322/,economics
"This empirical study examines the short- and long-run relationship between GDP as an economic growth indicator and CO2 emissions as an environmental pollution indicator in Myanmar by using annual time series data over the period of 1970-2014. It also carefully considered other proxies, such as trade openness, financial openness and urbanization, and structural breaks in the country. The fundamental objective of this study is to test the validity of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in the context of Myanmar. The dynamic estimates of the long- and short-term relationship among greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), GDP, trade intensity, financial openness, and urbanization growth are built through an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. The empirical findings indicate that there is positive short- and long-run relationship between CO2 and GDP and thus, no evidence of EKC hypothesis is found for CO2 in Myanmar. Nevertheless, the existence of the EKC is observed for CH4 and N2O. On the other hand, trade and financial openness have inverse relationship with CO2 emissions. These results demonstrate that trade liberalization and financial openness will improve the environment quality in Myanmar in the long run.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9567-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28710732/,economics
"According to the final consensus of a panel of intense discussions, the health care system should/can not be excluded from the economic laws of efficiency. Appropriate adaptation of various methods and instruments of economics make these tools applicable for use in the health care system. Due to errors in the implementation of economic methods, though, the question arises who is economically responsible in the health care system. The answer is found at three different levels of the health care system. The physician plays a leading role, both personally and professionally, in being primarily responsible for the direct medical treatment of the patient. The physician's dependence, however, on the health care system reduces his independence, which markedly affects his decision-making and treatment. Management of and in health care institutions is largely independent of the profession learned. Managers and physicians acting as managers must be appropriately and duly educated in the necessary specific talents and knowledge. The organisation of a health care system should also be reserved for trained specialists where the physicians as well as other professionals are obliged to acquire the skills necessary.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zgesun.2007.05.008,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17902409/,economics

In the second part of the paper, we also include fixed costs. While showing that our model without fixed costs has essentially the same simple solution as the model by Lefèvre [1] and Dayananda and Hogarth [2], the largest part of the paper deals with new structural properties such as an asymptotic behavior for large horizon and concavity of the minimal cost functions. The solutions in the model with and without fixed costs differ considerably.

"The physiotherapy industry can be analysed using Porter's (1979) five forces. Physiotherapy uses medical, geographic and funding segmentation. The power of the buyers in these segments is considerable. Substitutes are posing a threat to physiotherapy with few barriers to entry to operate in the health care environment. The suppliers, particularly doctors, have significant power in referring clients. Competitive rivalry for these clients can exist between individual physiotherapists and multi-disciplinary clinics. The difference in orientation of private and public physiotherapy can also be a basis for rivalry.

"Objectives:
        
      
      To inform allocation decisions in any healthcare system, robust cost data are indispensable. Nevertheless, recommendations on the most appropriate valuation approaches vary or are nonexistent, and no internationally accepted gold standard exists. This costing analysis exercise aims to assess the impact and implications of different calculation methods and sources based on the unit cost of general practitioner (GP) consultations in Austria.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six costing methods for unit cost calculation were explored, following 3 Austrian methodological approaches (AT-1, AT-2, AT-3) and 3 approaches applied in 3 other European countries (Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom). Drawing on Austrian data, mean unit costs per GP consultation were calculated in euros for 2015.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean unit costs ranged from €15.6 to €42.6 based on the German top-down costing approach (DE) and the Austrian Physicians' Chamber's price recommendations (AT-3), respectively. The mean unit cost was estimated at €18.9 based on Austrian economic evaluations (AT-1) and €17.9 based on health insurance payment tariffs (AT-2). The Dutch top-down (NL) and the UK bottom-up approaches (UK) yielded higher estimates (NL: €25.3, UK: €29.8). Overall variation reached 173%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study is the first to systematically investigate the impact of differing calculation methods on unit cost estimates. It shows large variations with potential impact on the conclusions in an economic evaluation. Although different methodological choices may be justified by the adopted study perspective, different costing approaches introduce variation in cross-study/cross-country cost estimates, leading to decreased confidence in data quality in economic evaluations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.06.001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32940231/,economics
"Incentive pricing programs have potential to promote economically efficient water use patterns and provide a revenue source to compensate for environmental damages. However, incentive pricing may impose disproportionate costs and aggravate poverty where high prices are levied for basic human needs. This paper presents an analysis of a two-tiered water pricing system that sets a low price for subsistence needs, while charging a price equal to marginal cost, including environmental cost, for discretionary uses. This pricing arrangement can promote efficient and sustainable water use patterns, goals set by the European Water Framework Directive, while meeting subsistence needs of poor households. Using data from the Rio Grande Basin of North America, a dynamic nonlinear program, maximizes the basin's total net economic and environmental benefits subject to several hydrological and institutional constraints. Supply costs, environmental costs, and resource costs are integrated in a model of a river basin's hydrology, economics, and institutions. Three programs are compared: (1) Law of the River, in which water allocations and prices are determined by rules governing water transfers; (2) marginal cost pricing, in which households pay the full marginal cost of supplying treated water; (3) two-tiered pricing, in which households' subsistence water needs are priced cheaply, while discretionary uses are priced at efficient levels. Compared to the Law of the River and marginal cost pricing, two-tiered pricing performs well for efficiency and adequately for sustainability and equity. Findings provide a general framework for formulating water pricing programs that promote economically and environmentally efficient water use programs while also addressing other policy goals.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.09.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18241978/,economics

"With the development of economic globalization and information technology, enterprises pay more attention to the sustainable development of their e-commerce. Under this trend, we study the subsidy strategy commonly used by pharmaceutical e-commerce platforms in two-sided market. Based on the two-sided market theory, we set up the two-sided user's utility function and formulate the subsidy strategy as the decision of platform profit optimization. We show that the platform chooses to subsidize consumers only if the net income from consumer is lower than the total revenue of drug retailers and platforms in each transaction; the maximum profit for platform increases with the intensity of the network externality.

"Background:
        
      
      Since 1 January 2004, inpatient treatment services in German hospitals have been reimbursed using a prospective payment method based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) rather than daily rates. The aim of the payment system reform was to decrease the length of inpatient stays and reduce overall healthcare expenditure, the latter of which had increased markedly during previous decades.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The primary objective of our study was to analyse and describe the health-economic consequences of implementing a DRG-based system of prospective payment in Germany.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search of the literature was performed on MEDLINE. Inclusion criteria were a focus on health economic variables from the German perspective and a publication date after 1 January 2004. The search was supplemented by a manual review of references, as well as internet-based hand search. The main health-economic conclusions were subsequently extracted from all of the included studies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 19 quantitative and qualitative studies were included. There were substantial differences between them in terms of medical focus and hospital characteristics. The most common health-economic variables analysed were revenue generated by patient treatment, and length of inpatient stay. As expected, both variables showed a decreasing trend following the introduction of DRGs. The included studies also investigated the development of case numbers, the proportion of outpatient services provided, the number of diagnoses per case, and the homogeneity of case groups. For these variables, the studies showed a wide range of results.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Similar to the experience with DRGs in many other countries, the introduction of DRGs in Germany has led to a reduction in the length of inpatient stay and a decrease in hospital revenues. The effects on other health-economic parameters are inconsistent.

"We consider a therapeutic market with potentially three pharmaceutical firms. Two of the firms offer horizontally differentiated brand-name drugs. One of the brand-name drugs is a new treatment under patent protection that will be introduced if the profits are sufficient to cover the entry costs. The other brand-name drug has already lost its patent and faces competition from a third firm offering a generic version perceived to be of lower quality. This model allows us to compare generic reference pricing (GRP), therapeutic reference pricing (TRP), and no reference pricing (NRP). We show that competition is strongest under TRP, resulting in the lowest drug prices (and medical expenditures). However, TRP also provides the lowest profits to the patent-holding firm, making entry of the new drug treatment least likely. Surprisingly, we find that GRP distorts drug choices most, exposing patients to higher health risks.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.11.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17188769/,economics

"In 2005, competition was introduced in part of the hospital market in the Netherlands. Using a unique dataset of transactions and list prices between hospitals and insurers in the years 2005 and 2006, we estimate the influence of buyer and seller concentration on the negotiated prices. First, we use a traditional structure-conduct-performance model (SCP-model) along the lines of Melnick et al. (J Health Econ 11(3): 217-233, 1992) to estimate the effects of buyer and seller concentration on price-cost margins. Second, we model the interaction between hospitals and insurers in the context of a generalized bargaining model similar to Brooks et al. (J Health Econ 16: 417-434, 1997). In the SCP-model, we find that the market shares of hospitals (insurers) have a significantly positive (negative) impact on the hospital price-cost margin. In the bargaining model, we find a significant negative effect of insurer concentration, but no significant effect of hospital concentration. In both models, we find a significant impact of idiosyncratic effects on the market outcomes. This is consistent with the fact that the Dutch hospital sector is not yet in a long-run equilibrium.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-010-0273-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20853127/,economics
"We present a model of contracting between a purchaser of health services and a provider (a hospital). We assume that hospitals provide two alternative treatments for a given diagnosis: a less intensive one (for example, a medical treatment) and a more intensive one (a surgical treatment). We assume that prices are set equal to the average cost reported by the providers, as observed in many OECD countries (yardstick competition). The purchaser has two options: (1) to set one tariff based on the diagnosis only and (2) to differentiate the tariff between the surgical and the medical treatment (i.e. to refine the tariff). We show that when tariffs are refined, the provider has always an incentive to overprovide the surgical treatment. If the tariff is not refined, the hospital underprovides the surgical treatment (and overprovides the medical treatment) if the degree of altruism is sufficiently low compared with the opportunity cost of public funds. Our main result is that price refinement might not be optimal.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1547,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19780065/,economics
"Study objective:
        
      
      To measure the direct and indirect costs of maintaining a ventilator-assisted individual (VAI) at home.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A cross-sectional survey was conducted of primary family caregivers of VAIs residing in 37 states.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Surveys were delivered to the homes of VAIs.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Two hundred seventy-seven (19.7%) of 1,404 primary family caregivers of patients who were ventilator-dependent and who were living at home. Interventions. None.
    


          Measures:
        
      
      Participants received the modified Katz Index and an investigator-developed Home Ventilator Care Cost and Utilization Survey (HVCCUS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Total cost of care was determined by summing total direct medical and nonmedical costs of home care and lost wages. Using LPN rates for private duty care, the average total cost of care was estimated to be $7,642 per month (median=$5,406). Using RN rates for private duty care, the average total cost of home care was estimated to be $8,596 per month (median=$5,911). Variation with VAI characteristics is discussed.

"In a period of generalized economic crisis, it seems particularly appropriate to try to manage a continuing growing sector such as healthcare in the best possible way. The crucial aim of optimization of available healthcare resources is obtaining the maximum possible benefit with the minimum expenditure. This has important social implications, whether individual citizens or tax-funded national health services eventually have to pay the bill. The keyword here is efficiency, which means either, maximizing the benefit from a fixed sum of money, or minimizing the resources required for a defined benefit. In order to achieve these objectives, economic evaluation is a helpful tool. Five different types of economic evaluation exist in the health-care field: cost-minimization, cost-benefit, cost-consequences, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the principal methods used for economic evaluation in healthcare. Economic evaluation represents a starting point for the allocation of resources, the decision of the valuable investments and the division of budgets across different health programs. Moreover, economic evaluation allows the comparison of different procedures in terms of quality of life and life expectancy, bearing in mind that cost-effectiveness is only one of multiple facets in the decision making-process. Economic evaluation is important to critically evaluate clinical interventions and ensure that we are implementing the most cost-effective management protocols.

"Purpose of review:
        
      
      To describe pharmacoeconomics and its relationship to drug interventions.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Pharmacoeconomics is the branch of economics which applies cost-minimization, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses to compare the economics of different pharmaceutical products or to compare drug therapy to other treatments. Among the four instruments, cost-utility analysis is the most sophisticated, relevant and clinically applicable as it measures the value conferred by drugs for the monies expended. Value-based medicine incorporates cost-utility principles but with strict standardization of all input and output parameters to allow the comparability of analyses, unlike the current situation in the healthcare literature.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Pharmacoeconomics is assuming an increasingly important role with regard to whether drugs are listed on the drug formulary of a country or province. It has been estimated that the application of standardized, value-based medicine drug analyses can save over 35% from a public healthcare insurer drug formulary while maintaining or improving patient care.",https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0b013e328129089e,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17435427/,economics
"The existing literature on modelling provides two main ways of viewing model migration: a modular view, which seeks to decompose models in their constitutive elements, and thus provides a view on what it is that migrates; and a practice-based view, which focuses on modelling as an activity, and understands a model as intricately entangled with its context of use. This article brings together these two sensitivities by focusing on ontologies of modelling. The paper presents a case study of the appropriation of modern finance theory's 'no-arbitrage' models by British actuaries - a process that gradually unfolded at around the turn of the century and led to significant friction within the UK's insurance industry. We can distinguish two main modelling ontologies: a 'risk-neutral ontology', which underpins no-arbitrage models and holds that the value of financial instruments is determined by 'arbitrage'; and, a 'real-world ontology', which assumes that the economic world consists of real probabilities that may be approximated through a combination of archival-statistical methods and expert judgment. The appropriation of the risk-neutral modelling ontology was made possible by the declining legitimacy of actuarial expertise as 'financial stewards' of life insurance companies. The risk-neutral modelling ontology provided an 'objective' alternative to the traditional actuarial models, which explicitly required actuaries to make 'prudent' judgments. Despite the fact that the no-arbitrage modelling was considered an 'objective' affair, the valuation models that insurers use today are strongly shaped by political compromises, a result of the 'rough edges' of models.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312719893465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31808731/,economics

We study the role of the distinct types of trader on the return statistics: specifically, correlation properties (or lack thereof), volatility clustering, heavy tails, and the degree to which the distribution can be described by a log-normal.

"Objective:
        
      
      To systematically review and appraise the quality of economic evaluations assessing centralisation of specialised healthcare services.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review to identify economic evaluations on centralisation of any specialised healthcare service. Full economic evaluations comparing costs and consequences of centralisation of any specialised healthcare service were eligible for inclusion. Methodological characteristics of included studies were appraised using checklists adapted from recommended guidelines.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 64 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. Two studies were conducted in the UK. Most of the studies used volume of activity as a proxy measure of centralisation. The methods used to assess centralisation were heterogeneous. Studies differed in terms of study design used and aspect of centralisation they considered. There were major limitations in studies. Only 12 studies reported the study perspective. Charges which are not true representation of costs were used by 17 studies to assess cost outcomes. Only 10 reported the detailed breakdown of the cost components used in their analysis. Discounting was necessary in 14 studies but was reported only in 7 studies. Sensitivity analyses were included by less than one-third of the studies. The applicability of the identified studies to a setting other than the one they were conducted in is questionable, given variations in the organisation of services and healthcare costs. Centralisation as a concept has also been variably and narrowly defined as activity of specific services which may not reflect the wider aspects of centralisation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Confounded and biased information coming from studies without standardised methods may mislead decision-makers towards making wrong decisions on centralisation.

"In order to assess the characteristics and influence on healthcare decision making of the economic assessment of drugs in Spain, pharmacoeconomic studies carried out between 1982 and 1992 were examined. We identified and analysed 16 pharmacoeconomic studies. The commonnest type of economic assessment was cost-effectiveness analysis. Only one study included measures of health-related quality of life. Only one study was carried out in conjunction with a controlled clinical trial. Evidence of influence on decision making was found in 6 studies. Two studies implemented hepatitis vaccination programmes, one set up a telephone follow-up of antituberculosis chemoprophylaxis, one developed the official procedures for using epoetin (recombinant human erythropoietin), one initiated clinical discussion meetings about the cost effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering therapy, and one strengthened the decision to register nebacumab (HA-1A, Centoxin), the monoclonal antibody against endotoxin. The quality of the studies was acceptable according to generally agreed checklists, although somewhat lower than those in other countries with longer traditions in this field. Improvement of the scientific quality of the studies and an increased use of the results for decision making need to be promoted. At present the number of studies of economic assessment of drugs in Spain is low, as is the influence of these studies on healthcare decision making. The movement of the Spanish healthcare authorities towards a selective drugs funding policy is likely to increase the number of studies and their impact on healthcare decision making.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199405020-00006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10146905/,economics
"This paper examines the influence of episode attribution methodology and cost outlier methodology on the accuracy of physicians' economic profiles. Four years of claims data from a mixed model HMO were processed using the leading episode grouper software. Episode grouped results then were applied to construct input distributions for a simulation model. For each of four specialties (cardiology, family practice, general surgery, and neurology), we employed sets of 18 simulations to investigate the effects of three alternative episode attribution methodologies and six alternative cost outlier methodologies on sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive error in classifying cost-efficient and cost-inefficient physicians. For identification of cost-efficient physicians, the most accurate profiling results were obtained when Winsorizing outliers at 2% and 98% of episode-type cost distributions, and attributing responsibility for episode costs to physicians who accounted for at least 30% of associated professional and prescribing fees. No consistent combination of outlier methodology and episode attribution rule was found to be superior for identifying cost-inefficient physicians.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_43.3.271,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17176969/,economics
"Climate change and increased greenhouse gas emissions boost the global average temperature to less than 2°C, which is the estimated breakeven point. The globe is moving into blue pollution economies as the environmental sustainability objective becomes more distorted. The study looked at three United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, namely (i) affordable and clean energy; (ii) industry, innovation, and infrastructure; and (iii) climate change, to see how far the Chinese economy has progressed toward green and clean development strategy. In the context of China, the ""pollution damage function"" was intended to refer to carbon damages related to carbon pricing, technological variables, sustained economic growth, incoming foreign investment, and green energy. The data was collected between 1975 and 2019 and analyzed using various statistical approaches. The results of the autoregressive distributed lag model suggest that carbon taxes on industrial emissions reduce carbon damages in the short and long run. Furthermore, a rise in inbound foreign investment and renewable energy demand reduces carbon damages in the short term, proving the ""pollution halo"" and ""green energy"" hypotheses; nonetheless, the results are insufficient to explain the stated results in the long run. In the long run, technology transfers and continued economic growth are beneficial in reducing carbon damages and confirming the potential of cleaner solutions in pollution mitigation. The causal inferences show the one-way relationship running from carbon pricing and technology transfer to carbon damages, and green energy to high-technology exports in a country. The impulse response estimates suggested that carbon tax, inbound foreign investment, and technology transfers likely decrease carbon damages for the next 10 years. On the other hand, continued economic growth and inadequate green energy sources are likely to increase carbon pollution in a country. The variance decomposition analysis suggested that carbon pricing and information and communication technology exports would likely significantly influence carbon damages over time. To keep the earth's temperature within the set threshold, the true motivation to shift from a blue to a green economy required strict environmental legislation, the use of green energy sources, and the export of cleaner technologies.

"Aim:
        
      
      We introduce a grouping system for clinical practice which allows the separation of DRG coding in specific orthopaedic groups based on anatomic regions, operative procedures, therapeutic interventions and morbidity equivalent diagnosis groups. With this, a differentiated aim-oriented analysis of illustrated internal DRG data becomes possible.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The group-specific difference of the coding quality between the DRG groups following primary coding by the orthopaedic surgeon and final coding by the medical controlling is analysed. In a consecutive series of 1600 patients parallel documentation and group-specific comparison of the relevant DRG parameters were carried out in every case after primary and final coding.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysing the group-specific share in the additional CaseMix coding, the group ""spine surgery"" dominated, closely followed by the groups ""arthroplasty"" and ""surgery due to infection, tumours, diabetes"". Altogether, additional cost-weight-relevant coding was necessary most frequently in the latter group (84%), followed by group ""spine surgery"" (65%). In DRGs representing conservative orthopaedic treatment documented procedures had nearly no influence on the cost weight.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The introduced system of case group analysis in internal DRG documentation can lead to the detection of specific problems in primary coding and cost-weight relevant changes of the case mix. As an instrument for internal process control in the orthopaedic field, it can serve as a communicative interface between an economically oriented classification of the hospital performance and a specific problem solution of the medical staff involved in the department management.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-965254,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17607637/,economics
"Eligibility for and enrollment in Medicaid can vary with economic recessions, recoveries, and changes in personal income. Understanding how Medicaid responds to such forces is important to budget analysts and policy makers tasked with forecasting Medicaid enrollment. We simulated eligibility for Medicaid for the period 2005-14 in two scenarios: assuming that each state's eligibility rules in 2009, the year before passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were in place during the entire study period; and assuming that the ACA's expanded eligibility rules were in place during the entire period for all states. Then we correlated the results with unemployment rates as a measure of the economy. Each percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate was associated with an increase in the share of people eligible for Medicaid of 0.32 percentage point under the 2009 eligibility rules and 0.77 percentage point under the ACA rules. Our simulations showed that the ACA expansion increased Medicaid's responsiveness to changes in unemployment. For states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility, our analysis demonstrates that increased responsiveness to periods of high unemployment is one benefit of expansion.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1076,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28069844/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The detrimental impact of smoking on health has been widely documented since the 1960s. Numerous studies have also quantified the economic cost that smoking imposes on society. However, these studies have mostly been in high income countries, with limited documentation from developing countries. The aim of this paper is to measure the economic cost of smoking-attributable diseases in countries throughout the world, including in low- and middle-income settings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Cost of Illness approach is used to estimate the economic cost of smoking attributable-diseases in 2012. Under this approach, economic costs are defined as either 'direct costs' such as hospital fees or 'indirect costs' representing the productivity loss from morbidity and mortality. The same method was applied to 152 countries, which had all the necessary data, representing 97% of the world's smokers.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The amount of healthcare expenditure due to smoking-attributable diseases totalled purchasing power parity (PPP) $467 billion (US$422 billion) in 2012, or 5.7% of global health expenditure. The total economic cost of smoking (from health expenditures and productivity losses together) totalled PPP $1852 billion (US$1436 billion) in 2012, equivalent in magnitude to 1.8% of the world's annual gross domestic product (GDP). Almost 40% of this cost occurred in developing countries, highlighting the substantial burden these countries suffer.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Smoking imposes a heavy economic burden throughout the world, particularly in Europe and North America, where the tobacco epidemic is most advanced. These findings highlight the urgent need for countries to implement stronger tobacco control measures to address these costs.",https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053305,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28138063/,economics
"Since the passage of the environmental legislation in the early 1970's, critics have attacked these laws as being unnecessary and for contributing significantly to the problem of inflation in the United States. This paper is an attempt to put the inflationary costs of air pollution into perspective by considering them in light of the cost, especially to public health, of not proceeding with pollution control. There is now a great deal of evidence that the concentration of certain pollutants in the air can contribute significantly to the incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and to certain forms of cancer. On the basis of the results of a recent study of the impacts of pollution control on inflation, the annual reduction in purchasing power of the average family is calculated to be $31 per family. To determine the average costs of air pollution on human health, research by Lave and Seskin is utilized. First, the implications of air pollution for mortality and morbidity rates are determined. Then, the reduction in direct health costs and indirect costs (lost productivity of workers) as a result of pollution abatement is estimated. These annual health costs from pollution total approximately $250 per family. The results suggest that the inflationary costs of air pollution control are more than offset by the damages to public health from unabated air pollution.",https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.8034185,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6771129/,economics

"We investigate the determinants of suicide in Finland using annual data for consumption and suicides from 1860 to 2010. Instead of using some ad hoc measures of cyclical movements of the economy, we build our analysis on a more solid economic theory. A key feature is the habit persistence in preferences, which provides a way to measure individual well-being and predict suicide. We estimate time series of habit levels and develop an indicator (the hardship index) to describe the economic hardship of consumers. The higher the level of the index, the worse off consumers are. As a rational response to such a bad situation, some consumers might commit suicide. We employ the autoregressive distributed lags cointegration method and find that our index works well in explaining the long-term behavior of people committing suicide in Finland.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-014-0658-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446657/,economics

"Falls in older people result in substantial health burden. Compelling evidence indicates that falls can be prevented. We developed comprehensive guidelines for economic evaluations of fall prevention interventions to facilitate publication of high-quality economic evaluations of the effective strategies and aid decision making.
    


          Introduction:
        
      
      The importance of economics applied to falls and fall prevention in older people has largely been overlooked. The use of different methodologies to assess the costs and health benefits of the interventions and their comparators and the inconsistent reporting in the studies limits the usefulness of these economic evaluations for decision making. We developed guidelines to encourage and facilitate completion of high-quality economic evaluations of effective fall prevention strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a generic checklist for economic evaluations as a platform to develop comprehensive guidelines for conducting and reporting economic evaluations of fall prevention strategies. We considered the many challenges involved, particularly in identifying, measuring, and valuing the relevant cost items.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We recommend researchers include cost outcomes and report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of falls prevented and quality adjusted life years in all clinical trials of fall prevention interventions. Studies should include the following cost categories: (1) implementing the intervention, (2) delivering the comparator group intervention, (3) total health care costs, (4) costs of fall-related health care resource use, and (5) personal and informal carer opportunity costs.

      This paper provides a timely benchmark to promote comparability and consistency for conducting and reporting economic evaluations of fall prevention strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-010-1482-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21104231/,economics
"In the prevailing climate of cost containment, doctors are increasingly expected to consider the economic consequences of treatment choices. Clinical (or medical) economics attempts to apply economic principles to the description and analysis of the costs of medical interventions, so as to identify how best to spend scarce health care resources. Such economic evaluations may assess the overall financial burden of a disease to society as a whole (macro-economics), or attempt to compare alternative treatment strategies for a specific clinical situation (micro-economics). In addition to expenditure on drugs and investigations (direct medical costs), economic studies may consider a variety of other costs. These include direct costs borne by patients (e.g. prescription charges, travel, food), indirect costs to society owing to lost productivity (resulting from morbidity or premature mortality) and even intangible costs which assign a monetary value to outcomes of disease such as pain, distress and anxiety. Four main types of economic analysis are in current use. Cost-minimization analysis attempts to identify the least expensive option in situations where there are a range of equally effective treatments for a given clinical condition, whereas cost-effectiveness analysis allows management strategies differing both in cost and efficacy to be compared. The cost-effectiveness of health care programmes targeting different disease states may also be compared using cost-utility analysis, in which health benefits are translated into a common utility-based unit of outcome, such as the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Cost-benefit analysis attempts to quantify health outcomes in monetary terms, so that the net result provides an assessment of value-for-money of health interventions. Gastrointestinal disorders are amongst the commonest of complaints, and considerable health care resources are consumed in treatment. Issues of cost-effectiveness are likely to assume increasing importance in gastroenterology because of the ever expanding range of drug choice, the increasing number of high cost treatments and the development of new therapeutic interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.1996.tb00177.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8871444/,economics
"The US Medicare program consumes an ever-rising share of the federal budget. Although this public spending can produce health and social benefits, raising taxes to finance it comes at the cost of slower economic growth. In this article we describe a model incorporating the benefits of public programs and the cost of tax financing. The model implies that the ""one-size-fits-all"" Medicare program, with everyone covered by the same insurance policy, will be increasingly difficult to sustain. We show that a Medicare program with guaranteed basic benefits and the option to purchase additional coverage could lead to more unequal health spending but slower growth in taxation, greater overall well-being, and more rapid growth of gross domestic product.

"Background:
        
      
      In low- and middle-income countries, multisite costing studies are increasingly used to estimate healthcare program costs. These studies have employed a variety of estimators to summarize sample data and make inferences about overall program costs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic review and simulation study to describe these estimation methods and quantify their performance in terms of expected bias and variance.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed the published literature through January 2017 to identify multisite costing studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries and extracted data on analytic approaches. To assess estimator performance under realistic conditions, we conducted a simulation study based on 20 empirical cost data sets.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The most commonly used estimators were the volume-weighted mean and the simple mean, despite theoretical reasons to expect bias in the simple mean. When we tested various estimators in realistic study scenarios, the simple mean exhibited an upward bias ranging from 12% to 113% of the true cost across a range of study sample sizes and data sets. The volume-weighted mean exhibited minimal bias and substantially lower root mean squared error. Further gains were possible using estimators that incorporated auxiliary information on delivery volumes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The choice of summary estimator in multisite costing studies can significantly influence study findings and, therefore, the economic analyses they inform. Use of the simple mean to summarize the results of multisite costing studies should be considered inappropriate. Our study demonstrates that several alternative better-performing methods are available.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.05.007,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31563257/,economics

"According to the accepted credo of German science policy the organization of research has to be reshaped to fit the needs of the national economy better than it did so in the past. This is seen as a conditio sine qua non to help German corporations to prevail in the global competition as well as to protect national welfare. The author argues that reorganizing research on a strictly mission-oriented line under economic imperatives will partly suspend the code of science in favor of the code of economy. The focal aim of science, which is to reach at the most reliable information in a methodical and impartial way, will be partly replaced by the aim to reach at the best sellable information in any way which is cheap and profitable. The probability that any information which might endanger the market performance of a product is clandestinely kept under cover by the selling corporation will be greatly enlarged.

These methods were then assessed. Indirect costs, as they have been measured, significantly influence efficiency ratios. A wide variation exists among studies in how they incorporate each of the components of indirect costs. All of the four components that were identified will affect the measurement of indirect cost.

"Background:
        
      
      Many of public hospitals in Japan have had a deficit for a long time. Japanese local governments have been encouraging public hospitals to use group purchasing of drugs to benefit from the economies of scale, and increase their bargaining power for obtaining discounts in drug purchasing, thus improving their financial situation. In this study, we empirically investigate whether or not the scale of public hospitals actually affects their bargaining power.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using micro-level panel data on public hospitals, we examine the effect of the scale of public hospitals (in terms of the number of occupancy beds) on drug purchasing efficiency (DPE) (the average discount rate in purchasing drugs) as a proxy variable of the bargaining power. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of the presence or absence of management responsibility in public hospital for economic efficiency as the proxy variable of an economic incentive and its interaction with the hospital scales on the bargaining power. In the estimations, we use the fixed effects model to control the heterogeneity of each hospital in order to estimate reliable parameters.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The scale of public hospitals does not positively correlate with bargaining power, whereas the management responsibility for economic efficiency does. Additionally, scale does not interact with management responsibility.
    


          Conclusion:

"Local hospital markets have been shown to vary extensively in per capita expenditures for hospital services and in the reimbursements paid per Medicare enrollee and per Blue Cross subscriber. Insurance premiums do not reflect these differences among local markets, resulting in intermarket subsidies (transfer payments) and distortion of competition between health-maintenance organizations and the fee-for-service system. Regulatory strategies to ""cap"" hospital costs have ignored these market variations and thus perpetuated the established pattern of expenditures and transfer payments. The plans for implementing a voucher system for the Medicare program set the value of the voucher according to average reimbursements at the county or state level. Since several markets can exist within one county's boundaries, the cash value established for the voucher in some low-cost markets will substantially exceed current per capita rates of reimbursement, permitting large profits and an increase in total costs to the Medicare program. If the price of health insurance were adjusted to correspond more closely to local market conditions, transfer payments would be reduced, and more effective regulation, competition, and consumer involvement might result.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198211253072204,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6813738/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Over the years, business valuation techniques have been widely used to appraise the financial worth of medical practices. However, it has been argued that medical practices are one of the most complex and difficult types of business enterprises to value.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of the current study is to develop a theoretical framework that sheds additional light on the determinants of a medical practice's value and to provide practitioners with a theory-based model on which to base valuations to avoid ""wild west"" scenarios where individual valuators use his or her own unique models that can lead to wild variations in the value amount of the same medical practice.
    


          Approach:
        
      
      The article starts by discussing standard approaches to valuing any business including medical practices. We then develop a theoretical framework that sheds additional light on the determinants of a medical practice's value by showing how strategic choice and environmental determinism affect the value of a medical practice. Once the framework is developed, the practice implications related to the framework are discussed.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      In this article, determinants of a medical practice's potential for sustained profitability are identified. Specifically, a framework is presented that shows how the combination of strategic choice and environmental determinism can affect a medical practice's chances of sustained profitability. Developing such a framework is an important contribution to the literature given that one of the most problematic areas of medical practice valuation is determining the factors that a valuator must assess to arrive at an appropriate fair market value for a practice.
    


          Practice implications:
        
      
      The development of a framework that sheds additional light on the determinants of a medical practice's value is important in light of the difficulty of obtaining reliable market data regarding sales of medical practices, which tend to be closely held private entities.",https://doi.org/10.1097/hmr.0b013e3181afc0d3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858920/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      Sustaining achievements in malaria control and making progress toward malaria elimination requires coordinated funding. We estimated domestic malaria spending by source in 106 countries that were malaria-endemic in 2000-16 or became malaria-free after 2000.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We collected 36 038 datapoints reporting government, out-of-pocket (OOP), and prepaid private malaria spending, as well as malaria treatment-seeking, costs of patient care, and drug prices. We estimated government spending on patient care for malaria, which was added to government spending by national malaria control programmes. For OOP malaria spending, we used data reported in National Health Accounts and estimated OOP spending on treatment. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to ensure estimates were complete and comparable across time and to generate uncertainty.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      In 2016, US$4·3 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 4·2-4·4) was spent on malaria worldwide, an 8·5% (95% UI 8·1-8·9) per year increase over spending in 2000. Since 2000, OOP spending increased 3·8% (3·3-4·2) per year, amounting to $556 million (487-634) or 13·0% (11·6-14·5) of all malaria spending in 2016. Governments spent $1·2 billion (1·1-1·3) or 28·2% (27·1-29·3) of all malaria spending in 2016, increasing 4·0% annually since 2000. The source of malaria spending varied depending on whether countries were in the malaria control or elimination stage.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Tracking global malaria spending provides insight into how far the world is from reaching the malaria funding target of $6·6 billion annually by 2020. Because most countries with a high burden of malaria are low income or lower-middle income, mobilising additional government resources for malaria might be challenging.

"The Medicare program reimburses dialysis providers a flat rate for a bundle of services that comprise the basic dialysis treatment. This payment system is being modified to incorporate case-mix adjustment for age and body size, which have been shown to influence dialysis costs. This study simulated the economic impact of the recently issued Medicare rule on case-mix adjustment by estimating the variation in payments across patients, facilities, and broad classes of facilities. Case-mix adjustment results in considerable patient-level variation in payments (dollar 12.99 SD in case-mix adjusted payments). The variation across dialysis facilities is smaller but still economically significant (dollar 3.77 SD). However, there was little evidence that particular classes of facilities (e.g., ownership, chain membership, size) will be substantially advantaged or disadvantaged by case-mix adjustment. There do seem to be modest changes in the regional distribution of payments.",https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2004110950,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15800122/,economics
"In order to evaluate the extent to which economic factors influence the life choices of people with mental illness, we interviewed 50 mentally ill people living in Boulder, Colorado. Subjects experience significant financial disincentives to work. The average total cash and noncash income of part-time employed subjects ($1,028 a month) is only modestly higher than that of unemployed subjects ($929 a month). Most clients calculate that $5 is the minimum hourly wage which makes work economically practical. Work disincentives could be improved by a more appropriately graduated scheme for reducing disability benefits for beginning workers. A wage subsidy would provide a work incentive to underproductive clients. Psychiatric treatment costs for unemployed subjects in this sample are twice those for the part-time employed. We suggest that research is needed to determine if treatment costs can be reduced by paying clients a wage subsidy.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02188618,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8556854/,economics
"According to data from the working reports of China's 244 prefecture-level city governments from 2004 to 2016, we used the instrumental variable method to identify the effects of governments' behavior of setting economic growth targets on regional green technology innovation. The results show that the setting and top-down amplification of economic growth targets have significant inhibitory effects on green technology innovation. The inhibitory effect is more prominent in cities with rapid economic growth and over fulfilment of economic growth targets. In addition, the higher the degree of over fulfilment of the economic target becomes, the more prominent the inhibiting effect is. An impact mechanism analysis reveals that economic growth target constraints affect regional green technology innovation through an industrial structure effect and foreign investment introduction effect.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112765,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34022652/,economics

"The process of innovation is inherently complex, and it occurs within an even more complex institutional environment characterized by incomplete information, market power, and externalities. There are therefore different competing approaches to supporting and financing innovation in medical technologies, which bring their own advantages and disadvantages. This article reviews value- and cost-based pricing, as well direct government funding, and cross-cutting institutional structures. It argues that performance-based risk-sharing agreements are likely to have little effect on the sustainability of financing; that there is a role for cost-based pricing models in some situations; and that the push towards longer exclusivity periods is likely contrary to the interests of industry.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-016-0416-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27251182/,economics
"To determine the economic impact of federal prospective payments and the potential effect if private insurance payers were to implement similar prospective payments, we examined payments under Medicare diagnosis-related grouping (DRG) reimbursement policies for 105 Medicare and 357 non-Medicare patients admitted to a tertiary care center via air transport. Among the 105 Medicare patients, the average length of stay was 11.4 days and the mortality rate was 24%. Hospital charges exceeded DRG reimbursement for 74% of Medicare patients. A comparison of previous Medicare payment policies to current federal DRG reimbursement resulted in a revenue loss to the hospital of $667,229 ($6335 per patient). For the 357 non-Medicare patients, the average length of stay was 10.8 days, the mortality rate was 10%, and hospital charges exceeded Medicare DRG reimbursement for 78% of the patients. Implementation of DRG-like payments by non-Medicare insurers would create a hospital revenue loss of $2,493,048 ($6983 per patient). We conclude that unless current and planned prospective payment policies are modified, the use of aeromedical transport services to recruit large numbers of critically ill patients to tertiary care centers is economically prohibitive.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00003246-198603000-00012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3080276/,economics
"The societies of western countries are facing enormous economic and social challenges.

The bottleneck within the surgical specialties in case of efficient scheduling will be the capacity utilization of the operating theatres.

"The increasing costs of health-care and the need for cost containment have resulted in a 'fourth hurdle' in the establishment of drug approval and reimbursement policies. This hurdle is the demonstration of a drug's cost-effectiveness through the process of economic evaluation. The role of models in the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals is becoming increasingly accepted with the recent trend towards developing models with greater transparency and clinical relevance. However, health-care decisions do not, and should not, rely solely on the cost-effectiveness of a drug or intervention. Factors such as disease severity, availability of alternative treatment strategies, cost of drugs to patients, compliance with therapy and patients' satisfaction with overall treatment effectiveness should also be considered, and in some cases can be incorporated into economic evaluation. The Arthritis Cost Consequences Evaluation System (ACCES) is provided as an example of the attributes and limitations that should be considered in determining the usefulness of a model for economic evaluations with the purpose of determining reimbursement policy decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keg499,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14585919/,economics

"The pharmacoeconomics is relatively new field in pharmaceutical science. In August, Pharmaceutical Society of Japan published ""model core curriculums for pharmacy education"" and pharmacoeconomics is included in it. As the Japanese health insurance system is composed of fee for service system and small patients' co-payment, physicians as well as patients have not needed pharmacoeconomic analysis. However the recent economic squeeze begin to direct their attention to the pharmacoeconomics research. The pharmacoeconomic analysis is intended to show alternatives to the decision maker for their consideration. The analyst should not impose his of her conclusion on the decision maker. The analysis must reflect the actual medical practice under the circumstances where the decision-making will be done. Pharmacists in hospitals are expected to conduct pharmacoeconomic analysis for themselves, using their hospital's data, for their decision maker, hospital manager.

"The social security counterreform, initiated in 1997, forms part of the neoliberal reorganization of Mexican society. The reform implies a profound change in the guiding principles of social security, as the public model based on integrality, solidarity, and redistribution is replaced by a model based on private administration of funds and services, individualization of entitlement, and reduction of rights. Its economic purpose is to move social services and benefits into the direct sphere of private capital accumulation. Although these changes will involve the whole social security system--old-age and disability pensions, health care, child care, and workers' compensation--they are most immediately evident in the pension scheme. The pay-as-you-go scheme is being replaced by privately managed individual retirement accounts which especially favor the big financial groups. These groups are gaining control over huge amounts of capital, are authorized to charge a high commission, and run no financial risks. The privatization of the system requires decisive state intervention with a legal change and a sizable state subsidy (1 to 1.5 percent of GNP) over five decades. The supposed positive impact on economic growth and employment is uncertain.

"Canada's health care institutions are under pressure to limit expenditures, maintain or increase productivity, and assimilate new technology. Even though more than 75% of hospital operating expenditures are controllable, according to a study by the Economic Council of Canada, cost systems are needed to provided essential management information. The new Canadian Management Information System (MIS) Guidelines for health care are designed to provide accurate cost measurement of patient treatment and to help managers evaluate the impact of planned program changes on areas of operational responsibility. Other potential benefits of implementing the MIS guidelines include correcting dysfunctional funding of health care units with benchmarking and setting high reporting standards for resource use at the patient level (MIS, 1991). This paper focuses on one important aspect of bringing these costs under control by examining the relation between cost deviations (variances) and underlying cost drivers. Our discussion will lead to the conclusion that incompatibility of DRG methodology and traditional cost accounting models may be an important source of cost variability within diagnostically-related disease groupings.",https://doi.org/10.1177/095148489500800402,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10153271/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      With an increasing burden of non-communicable disease in Nepal and limited progress towards universal health coverage, country- and disease-specific estimates of financial hardship related to healthcare costs need to be evaluated to protect the population effectively from healthcare-related financial burden.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To estimate the cost and economic burden of illness and to assess the inequality in the financial burden due to catastrophic health expenditure from 1995 to 2010 in Nepal.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study used nationally representative Nepal Living Standards Surveys conducted in 1995 and 2010. A Bayesian two-stage hurdle model was used to estimate average cost of illness and Bayesian logistic regression models were used to estimate the disease-specific incidence of catastrophic health payment and impoverishment. The concentration curve and index were estimated by disease category to examine inequality in healthcare-related financial hardship.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Inflation-adjusted mean out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for chronic illness and injury increased by 4.6% and 7.3%, respectively, while the cost of recent acute illness declined by 1.5% between 1995 and 2010. Injury showed the highest incidence of catastrophic expenditure (30.7% in 1995 and 22.4% in 2010) followed by chronic illness (12.0% in 1995 and 9.6% in 2010) and recent acute illness (21.1% in 1995 and 7.8% in 2010). Asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, malaria, jaundice and parasitic illnesses showed increased catastrophic health expenditure over time. Impoverishment due to injury declined most (by 12% change in average annual rate) followed by recent acute illness (9.7%) and chronic illness (9.6%) in 15 years. Inequality analysis indicated that poorer populations with recent acute illness suffered more catastrophic health expenditure in both sample years, while wealthier households with injury and chronic illnesses suffered more catastrophic health expenditure in 2010.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To minimize the economic burden of illness, several approaches need to be adopted, including social health insurance complemented with an upgraded community-based health insurance system, subsidy program expansion for diseases with high economic burden and third party liability motor insurance to reduce the economic burden of injury.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29617393/,economics
"Policymakers fear that health insurers when exposed to competition will engage in cream-skimming (i.e. selection of good risks) rather than trying to improve their benefit to premium ratio. This fear surfaced also when Swiss federal government proposed pro-competitive Law on social health insurance, which barely passed a popular referendum in 1994. While a risk equalization mechanism based on age, gender, and place of residence has already been created, there is a considerable interest in improving its formula. This paper shows that a dummy variable indicating an individual's death during the period of observation causes the coefficient of determination to jump from 0.039 to 0.111. More-over, simulations of the risk selection process suggest that risk equalization should be made a permanent institution rather than being limited to a life of 10 years as prescribed by present legislation. In fact, the formula in use, with all its shortcomings, can be shown to neutralize to a great extent insurer interest in cream skimming provided he takes a longer-run view.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-5681-7_11,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10662405/,economics
"A broad consensus holds that increased medical capability-technology-is the primary driver of health spending growth. However, technology does not expand independently of historical context; it is fueled by rising incomes and more generous insurance coverage. We estimate that medical technology explains 27-48 percent of health spending growth since 1960-a smaller percentage than earlier estimates. Income (gross domestic product, or GDP) growth plays a critical role, primarily through the actions of governments and employers on behalf of pools of consumers. The contribution of insurance is likely to differ, with less of a push from increasing generosity of coverage and more of a push from changes in provider payment.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.28.5.1276,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19738242/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      Competition from ""follow-on"" drugs has been a highly controversial issue. Manufacturers launching new molecules in existing drug classes have often been criticized for inflating health systems' expenses, but it has been argued that such drugs increase therapeutic options. Economic theory suggests that follow-on drugs induce price competition. We contribute to this discussion by addressing the topic of pricing at market entry and price development in the German market.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We measure determinants of price strategies of follow-on drugs using regression analyses, considering all new molecules launched in the German market from 1993 to 2008. Prices of products are standardized on defined daily dosages controlling for sales volumes based on data from the IMS Health DPM database and for the therapeutic quality of a new product using ratings by Fricke/Klaus as a proxy for innovation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identify prices correlating with therapeutic value at market entry. While the first two molecules engage in quality competition, price discounts below the market price can be observed from the third entrant on. Price discounts are even more distinct in development races with several drugs entering the market within 2 years and in classes with a low degree of therapeutic differentiation. Prices remain relatively constant over time.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study contributes to assessments of competition in pharmaceutical markets focusing on price strategies of new market entrants. After an initial phase of market building, further follow-on products induce price competition. Largely unchanged prices after 4 years may be interpreted as quality competition and can be attributed to prices in Germany being anchor points for international price referencing.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-013-0555-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24370790/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      There is a growing need to evaluate the factors contributing to the increase in health expenditures, as well as the cost of medicines used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the economically developed countries.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      A systematic searching of studies describing the direct cost of T2DM and medicine cost of treating T2DM. The quality of the studies found eligible for this study were assessed using a methodological quality appraisal tool. Nine studies were included in this review. All the included studies had data on direct cost and antidiabetic medicine cost of health care. Mean annual direct cost per person/year ranged between US$220 and US$7600. The two components with the greatest impact on direct cost were found to be medicines and hospitalization. The mean annual medicines cost per person/year was found to range between US$140 and US$2990.

"In this paper, we outline how to use cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective and the arguments that could be made for using data such as a model for economic evaluation of health care. We show that to include all the costs in the analysis, a price per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained rather than a given budget should be used as the decision rule. Using cost-utility analysis this way is based on a willingness to pay per QALY gained that is constant and the same for everyone. To use a fixed price per QALY gained is consistent with societal utility maximization if aggregated QALYs are a measure of societal utility and if the mix of financing sources is the same for all health care programmes. If, furthermore, the price per QALY gained is set at the optimal level, cost-utility analysis will lead to a maximization of societal utility. To get more information on the willingness to pay per QALY gained so as to provide cost-utility analysis with a useful decision rule should be a research priority.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-8510(96)00878-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10165464/,economics

We use theoretical and empirical evidence to address the question, ""How will employers' offerings of health insurance change under health reform?"" First, we describe the economic reasons why employers offer insurance. Second, we recap the relevant provisions of health reform and use our economic framework to consider how they may affect employers' offerings. Third, we review the various predictions that have been made about those offerings under health reform.

"Economic evaluations are analytic techniques to assess the relative costs and consequences of health care programmes and technologies. Their role is to provide rigorous data to inform the health care decision-making process. Economic evaluation may oversimplify complex health care decisions. These analyses often ignore important health consequences, contextual elements, relationships or other relevant modifying factors, which might not be appropriate in a multi-objective, multi-stakeholder issue. One solution would be to develop a new paradigm based on the issues of perspective and context. Complexity theory may provide a useful conceptual framework for economic evaluation in health care. Complexity thinking develops an awareness of issues including uncertainty, contextual issues, multiple perspectives, broader societal involvement, and transdisciplinarity. This points the economic evaluation field towards an accountability and epistemology based on pluralism and uncertainty, requiring new forms of lay-expert engagement and roles of lay knowledge into decision-making processes. This highlights the issue of reflexivity in economic evaluation in health care. A reflexive approach would allow economic evaluators to analyze how objective structures and subjective elements influence their practices. In return, this would point increase the integrity and reliability of economic evaluations. Reflexivity provides opportunities for critically thinking about the organization and activities of the intellectual field, and perhaps the potential of moving in new, creative directions.

"The scarcity of resources available to meet the growing demand for healthcare services has increased interest in economic evaluation as a tool to inform resource allocation. The aim of economic evaluation is to compare various alternatives for action, in terms of their costs and effects on health, by using several techniques: cost minimization analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. Irrespective of the methodology used, any assessment must include scope of the problem, selection of alternatives for comparison, explication of the perspective of analysis and the time horizon, measurement and evaluation of costs and health effects, presentation of results, and sensitivity analysis. In Spain, evaluation of currently ongoing preventive interventions, and adherence to the existing economic evaluation guidelines by researchers would be desirable.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0213-9111(11)70005-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22055548/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      As part of the proposed changes to re-design the Irish health-care system, the Department of Health (money follows the patient-policy paper on hospital financing, 2013b) outlined a new funding model for Irish hospitals-money follows the patient (MFTP). This will replace the existing system which is predominately prospective with hospitals receiving a block grant per annum. MFTP will fund episodes of care rather than hospitals. Thus, hospital revenue will be directly linked to activity [activity-based funding (ABF)].
    


          Theory and literature review:
        
      
      With ABF there is a fundamental shift to a system where hospitals generate their own income and this changes incentive structures. While some of these incentives are intended (reducing cost per case and increasing coding quality), others are less intended and less desirable. As a result, there may be reductions in quality, upcoding, cream skimming and increased pressure on other parts of the health system. In addition, MFTP may distort health system priorities. There are some feasibility concerns associated with the implementation of MFTP. Data collection, coding and classification capacity are crucial for its success. While MFTP can build on existing systems, significant investment is required for its success. This includes investment in coding and classification, infrastructure, skills, IT, contracting, commissioning, auditing and performance monitoring systems.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite the challenges facing implementers, MFTP could greatly improve the transparency and accountability of the system. Thus if the downside risks are managed, there is potential for MFTP to confer significant benefits to Irish hospital care.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-013-1050-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24310378/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the direct and indirect cost of care incurred by patients with schizophrenia attending a tertiary care psychiatry unit in Colombo.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Study was carried out at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Systematic sampling selected every second patient with an ICD-10 clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia presenting to the clinic during a two month period. Investigator administered semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sample consisted of 91 patients. Direct cost was defined as cost incurred by the patient (out of pocket expenditure) for outpatient care. Mean cost of a clinic visit was Rs. 500. Of the clinic visit cost, highest proportions were travel cost (39.8%) and medication (26.4%). Sixty four (70.3%) had received informal care. The mean cost of informal care during the entire course of the illness was Rs. 33, 540. Mean indirect cost was Rs. 150,190.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite low direct cost of care, indirect cost and cost of informal treatment results in substantial economic impact on patients and their families. It is recommended that economic support should be provided for patients with disabling illnesses such as schizophrenia, especially when patients are unable to engage in full time employment. There is a need to educate the public regarding higher cost of care by traditional healers and other informal modes of treatment compared to Western medical care.",https://doi.org/10.4038/cmj.v57i1.4195,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22453706/,economics
"The fact that sick elderly people without prescription drug coverage pay far more for drugs than do people with private health insurance has created a call for state and federal governments to take action. Antitrust cases have been launched, state price control legislation has been enacted, and proposals for expansion of Medicare have been offered in response to price and spending levels for prescription drugs. This paper offers an analysis aimed at understanding pricing patterns of brand-name prescription drugs. I focus on the basic economic forces that enable differential pricing of products to exist and show how features of the prescription drug market promote such phenomena. The analysis directs policy attention toward how purchasing practices can be changed to better represent groups that pay the most and are most disadvantaged.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.20.2.115,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11260933/,economics
"We use a 575,000-subject, 28-day experiment to investigate monetary policy in a virtual setting. The experiment tests the effect of virtual currency endowments on player retention and virtual currency demand. An increase in endowments of a virtual currency should lower the demand for the currency in the short run. However, in the long run, we would expect money demand to rise in response to inflation in the virtual world. We test for this behavior in a virtual field experiment in the football management game Top11. 575,000 players were selected at random and allocated to different ""shards"" or versions of the world. The shards differed only in terms of the initial money endowment offered to new players. Money demand was observed for 28 days as players used real money to purchase additional virtual currency. The results indicate that player money purchases were significantly higher in the shards where higher endowments were given. This suggests that a positive change in the money supply in a virtual context leads to inflation and increased money demand, and does so much more quickly than in real-world economies. Differences between virtual and real currency behavior will become more interesting as virtual currency becomes a bigger part of the real economy.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186407,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29045494/,economics
"Italy has a national health service (SSN) that is moving toward decentralization and empowerment of local health enterprises (LHEs)-the arms of the regions for delivering health services. Drug policy and spending decisions are both influenced by central government and local authorities. At the ""macro"" level, the government holds the power to decide the amount of drug expenditure, currently at 13% of total SSN expenditure; the pricing policy, price negotiation, reference price, and price cuts; criteria for reimbursement, inclusion in the positive list, and restrictive notes; and the copayments and exemptions. So far, the government concern has been predominantly on cost containment, and its approach in selecting drugs for reimbursement has been cost minimization. Italy has no centralized office for health technology assessment and this hinders the search for an efficient use of drugs. At the ""micro"" level, however, the LHEs are showing a great vitality in fostering a better use of drugs by general practitioners. One of the tools employed is local voluntary agreements between LHEs and general practitioners (GPs) that may be supported by economic incentives, in cash or in kind. In 2000 there were 61 agreements in place, 31% of total LHEs, which concerned the respect of drug expenditure ceilings and the local development and implementation of clinical guidelines (47% of LHEs). A traditional and widespread tool for controlling drug expenditure is providing GPs with regular reports on their drug prescriptions (59% of LHEs). Monitoring, moral suasion, and clinical guidelines are the main incentives for efficiency at local level, but focus on health outcomes is limited. The cost-containment mentality still prevails and the use of drug budget for purchasing better health is at its very early stage.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1524-4733.6.s1.4.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12846924/,economics

The model derives the behaviour of patients, pharmacists, drug producers and parallel-importers from microeconomic principles and recognizes the interactions between the various actors. The latter is important since the general-equilibrium effects are sometimes at odds with intuition from a partial-equilibrium approach. A calibrated version of the model is used to evaluate the effects of various policy experiments on the bill for pharmaceutical care in the Netherlands. These experiments include an incentive policy to encourage cost-conscious drug distribution, an increase of copayments for pharmaceutical care, a reduction of trade barriers for parallel-importers, and market entry by producers of generic substitutes.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199908)8:5<391::aid-hec457>3.0.co;2-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10470546/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      The pharmaceutical industry in Iran is influenced by various parameters such as internal factors caused by the financial information of each economic unit and external factors including major economic and non-economic variables.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study is aiming to examine the effect of such variables on the stock return of 34 pharmaceutical companies in the Tehran Securities Exchange market using quarterly data from 1995 to 2016. In this research, an autoregressive model was utilized to examine the way that variables affect the stock market index. In such patterns, there is no need for explicit short-term structural relationships and structural knowledge is extracted from causal relationships. Finally, to analyze the results, impulse-response functions, forecast error variance, and historical decomposition were collected.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results of this research show that positive shock to the variables, namely the currency rate, collection period of quests, and healthcare costs lead to a decrease in the return of pharmaceutical companies. On the other hand, a positive shock to the variables such as GDP, and money volume, leads to an increase in the stock return of pharmaceutical companies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Different factors contribute to the stock return of pharmaceutical companies. Among the variables examined in this study, market currency rate, money volume, pharmaceutical sector inflation, bank interest rate, GDP in the healthcare sector, healthcare costs, and collection period of quests have the most effect on describing changes within the stock return of pharmaceutical companies.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4735-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31888627/,economics
"One of the critical policy questions raised by the AIDS epidemic is the proper size of the United States federal government's commitment to AIDS-related research. The extent of the federal government's investment in AIDS-related research in relation to research investments in cancer, coronary heart disease, and unintentional injuries is examined. Appropriation levels for fiscal year 1986 are divided by indexes of projected disease burden for 1991 to create a research investment ratio for each health impairment. Indexes of disease burden include numbers of total deaths, early deaths, expected life years lost, and discounted life years lost and direct economic costs. Despite the uncertainty about the future of the AIDS epidemic, there is no indication that AIDS is being overfunded relative to cancer and heart disease. Injuries appear to receive relatively low funding priority. Confident conclusions about research priority depend upon resolution of qualitative considerations and better understanding of the dynamics of the AIDS epidemic.",https://doi.org/10.1093/clinids/10.1.159,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3353627/,economics
"Pharmaceutical firms have been criticized for concentrating efforts of R&D on the so-called me-too or follow-on drugs. There have been many comments for and against the dissemination of these incremental innovations but few papers have broached the subject from an econometric point of view, possibly because identification of me-too or follow-on drugs is not so obvious. This paper focuses on the impact of entry order on follow-on drug competition in the French market between the years 2001 and 2007. More precisely, this study examines the effects on market share of first entrants in the follow-on drug market and how this possible competitive advantage changes over time. First results are coherent with theoretical microeconomic issues concerning the importance of being first. We find evidence that first movers in the follow-on drug market have the ability to capture and maintain greater market share for a long period of time. The hierarchical market position of follow-on drugs does not seem to be affected by generic drug emergence. From a dynamic perspective, our analysis shows that market share is positively correlated with the ability of follow-on drugs to set prices higher than the average follow-on drug prices in a specific therapeutic class, which means that market power remains considerably important for first movers. Moreover, we found that the optimum level of innovation to maximize market share is the highest one.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-014-0654-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25501258/,economics

"Background:
        
      
      China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) enables insured citizens to enjoy the same benefit package by paying a flat-rate premium. However, it still remains uncertain whether economically disadvantaged enrollees receive insurance benefits that at least match those of non-disadvantaged enrollees. This article, therefore, estimates the distribution of benefits under the NCMS across economic groups and compares the magnitude of economic-related inequity changes in the NCMS benefits.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were drawn from two-wave large-scale representative and comparable cross-sectional household health survey datasets conducted in Shaanxi Province in 2008 and 2013. In total, 9506 (2008) and 38,010 (2013) NCMS enrollees were included. The benefits from the NCMS are measured in two ways: via the probability of receiving reimbursements and via the absolute amount of the obtained reimbursements. Two-part models were used to estimate the benefit distribution and to adjust benefits for health care needs. Concentration curve, dominance test of the concentration curve, and concentration index (CI) were used to estimate the overall degree of economic-related inequality. The degree of horizontal inequity was estimated via indirectly standardized measures based on the ""equal treatment for equal needs"" concept.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our results indicate that economically affluent groups were more likely to receive reimbursements from the NCMS, and these reimbursements were also higher. Positive need-adjusted CIs for the probability of receiving reimbursements (CIs: 0.2027/0.1056 in 2008/2013) and the absolute amount of reimbursements (CIs: 0.3002/0.1660 in 2008/2013) further suggest the existence of clear pro-rich horizontal inequities in the benefits distribution under the NCMS. Encouragingly, a decreasing trend could be observed from 2008 to 2013, which suggests that horizontal inequities in NCMS benefits that favored the rich decreased over the investigated period, while the level of insurance benefits improved.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study suggests that the benefits of NCMS are concentrated toward economically affluent groups. Although any trade-off between policy feasibility and equity has become a challenge for the formulation of social health insurance funding and benefit packages in developing countries, inequality can be gradually reduced through continuous adjustment of the medical insurance scheme, thus effectively targeting economically disadvantaged enrollees.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-018-0852-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30185181/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Oral anticancer drugs (OADs) allow treating a growing range of cancers. Despite their convenience, their acceptance by healthcare professionals and patients may be affected by medical, economical and organizational factors. The way the healthcare payment system (HPS) reimburses OADs or finances hospital activities may impact patients' access to such drugs. We discuss how the HPS in France and USA may generate disincentives to the use of OADs in certain circumstances.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      French public and private hospitals are financed by National Health Insurance (NHI) according to the nature and volume of medical services provided annually. Patients receiving intravenous anticancer drugs (IADs) in a hospital setting generate services, while those receiving OADs shift a part of service provision from the hospital to the community. In 2013, two million outpatient IADs sessions were performed, representing a cost of €815 million to the NHI, but positive contribution margin of €86 million to hospitals. Substitution of IADs by OADs mechanically induces a shortfall in hospital income related to hospitalizations. Such economic constraints may partially contribute to making physicians reluctant to prescribe OADs. In the US healthcare system, coverage for OADs is less favorable than coverage for injectable anticancer drugs. In 2006, a Cancer Drug Coverage Parity Act was adopted by several states in order to provide patients with better coverage for OADs. Nonetheless, the complexity of reimbursement systems and multiple reimbursement channels from private insurance represent real economic barriers which may prevent patients with low income being treated with OADs. From an organizational perspective, in both countries the use of OADs generates additional activities related to physician consultations, therapeutic education and healthcare coordination between hospitals and community settings, which are not considered in the funding of hospitals activities so far.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Funding of healthcare services is a critical factor influencing in part the choice of cancer treatments and this is expected to become increasingly important as economic constraints grow. Drug reimbursement systems and hospital financing changes, coupled with other accompanying measures, should contribute to improve equal and safe patient access to appropriate anticancer drugs and improve the management and care pathway of cancer patients.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-14-274,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24950778/,economics

This study, within the scope of related discussion, aims to look into the potential impact of foreign direct investments on CO2 emission in Turkey in 1974-2013 period using environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model. For this purpose, Maki (Econ Model 29(5):2011-2015, 2012) structural break cointegration test, Stock and Watson (Econometrica 61:783-820, 1993) dynamic ordinary least square estimator (DOLS), and Hacker and Hatemi-J (J Econ Stud 39(2):144-160, 2012) bootstrap test for causality method are used. Research results indicate the existence of a long-term balance relationship between FDI, economic growth, energy usage, and CO2 emission. As per this relationship, in Turkey, (1) the potential impact of FDI on CO2 emission is positive. This result shows that PHH is valid in Turkey.

"Preventive and therapeutic advances have brought life expectancy in the United States to well over 70 years and have shifted mortality causes from acute to chronic diseases, the determinants of which are genetics, lifestyle, the environment, and aging itself. Plausible approaches to chronic disease prevention are likely to increase longevity further, with some foreseeable effects on demographic and economic projections. Primarily, longevity advances would swell forecasts of population size, and would thus have to be met by production advances in order to maintain or improve living standards.

According to the results, prevention would reduce outlays for life insurance, disability, and health care, but would also generate the higher costs of extending pension plans.

"Although the role that renewable energy consumption plays on economic growth and emissions has been widely studied, there are relatively few papers focusing on the determinants of renewable energy consumption, and only one study focuses on the factors related to the share of renewables in the energy consumption in Africa. This paper contributes to the literature by filling the gap in knowledge by exploring the nexus between the share of renewables in energy consumption and social and economic variables, for a panel consisting of 21 African countries for the period between 1990 and 2013, extending the set of variables and the time span used by a previous study. Estimating a random-effects generalized least squares regression, we find that countries with a higher Human Development Index and a higher gross domestic product per capita have a lower share of renewable energy in the national grid. On the other hand, an increase in foreign direct investment has been found to be related to higher renewable energy integration. The level of democracy, measured by the Freedom House political rights and civil liberties ratings, does not directly affect the integration level of renewable energy sources. The negative relationship between gross domestic product per capita and the share of renewables contradicts previous findings for developed countries.

"Background:
        
      
      Psoriasis has significant economic impact on patients. However, its total economic burden has not been fully quantified.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the annual economic burden of psoriasis in the United States.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review was conducted to obtain estimates of the components of the economic burden of psoriasis. Prevalence estimates were used to estimate the 2013 psoriasis population. Incremental medical costs were calculated based on studies that compared psoriasis patients and controls. Productivity loss was estimated using measures of presenteeism, absenteeism, and unemployment. Reductions in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were calculated from survey responses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of psoriasis in the US was estimated to be 7.4 million in 2013. Comparatively, psoriasis patients incurred incremental medical costs of $2284, experienced a $2203 reduction in HRQOL, and a $1935 reduction in productivity. The total burden of psoriasis was estimated as $35.2 billion, with $12.2 billion in incremental medical costs (35%), $11.8 billion from reduced HRQOL (34%), and $11.2 billion from productivity losses (32%).

"Objective:
        
      
      An estimated 6-10 million people in India live with active epilepsy, and less than half are treated. We analyze the health and economic benefits of three scenarios of publicly financed national epilepsy programs that provide: (1) first-line antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs), (2) first- and second-line AEDs, and (3) first- and second-line AEDs and surgery.

      We model the prevalence and distribution of epilepsy in India using IndiaSim, an agent-based, simulation model of the Indian population. Agents in the model are disease-free or in one of three disease states: untreated with seizures, treated with seizures, and treated without seizures. Outcome measures include the proportion of the population that has epilepsy and is untreated, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and cost per DALY averted. Economic benefit measures estimated include out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure averted and money-metric value of insurance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All three scenarios represent a cost-effective use of resources and would avert 800,000-1 million DALYs per year in India relative to the current scenario. However, especially in poor regions and populations, scenario 1 (which publicly finances only first-line therapy) does not decrease the OOP expenditure or provide financial risk protection if we include care-seeking costs. The OOP expenditure averted increases from scenarios 1 through 3, and the money-metric value of insurance follows a similar trend between scenarios and typically decreases with wealth. In the first 10 years of scenarios 2 and 3, households avert on average over US$80 million per year in medical expenditure.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      Expanding and publicly financing epilepsy treatment in India averts substantial disease burden. A universal public finance policy that covers only first-line AEDs may not provide significant financial risk protection. Covering costs for both first- and second-line therapy and other medical costs alleviates the financial burden from epilepsy and is cost-effective across wealth quintiles and in all Indian states.",https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.13294,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26765291/,economics
"Aims:
        
      
      There is growing demand for economic analysis to support strategic decision-making for mental health but the availability of economic evidence, in particular on system performance remains limited. The Mental Health Economics European Network (MHEEN) was set up in 2002 with the broad objective of developing a base for mental health economics information and subsequent work in 17 countries.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data on financing, expenditure and costs, provision of services, workforce, employment and capacity for economic evaluation were collected through bespoke questionnaires developed iteratively by the Network. This was augmented by a literature review and analysis of international databases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Findings on financing alone suggest that in many European countries mental health appears to be neglected while mechanisms for resource allocation are rarely linked to objective measure of population mental health needs. Numerous economic barriers and potential solutions were identified. Economic incentives may be one way of promoting change, although there is no 'one size fits all solution.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There are significant benefits and synergies to be gained from the continuing development of networks such as MHEEN. In particular the analysis can be used to inform developments in Central and Eastern Europe. For instance there is much that can be learnt on both how the balance of care between institutional and non-institutional care has changed and on the role played by economic incentives in ensuring that resources were used to develop alternative community-based systems.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1121189x00004310,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16865932/,economics
"Why do the states seem to be pursuing different types of policy innovation in their health reform? Why so some seem to follow a ""solidarity principle,"" while others seem guided by a commitment to ""actuarial fairness""? Our analysis highlights the reciprocal influence of stakeholder mobilization and public policy over time. We find that early policy choices about how to achieve cost containment led the states down different paths of reform. In the 1970s and 1980s, states that featured oligopolistic or near-monopolistic markets for private insurance (usually dominated by Blue Cross) and strong urban-academic hospitals tended to adopt regulatory strategies for cost containment that led to broader forms of pooling and financing the costs of health risks--which subsequently positioned them to pursue major, solidaristic reform on favorable terms. On the other hand, states with competitive markets for private insurance and weak, decentralized hospitals tended to adopt market-based strategies for cost containment that led to the hypersegmentation of risk and the uneven financing of costs--thereby encouraging the proliferation of incremental policies that reinforce the principle of actuarial fairness. We illustrate our analysis with a brief comparison of Massachusetts and California, and we conclude with some thoughts on what our findings imply for the federal role in catalyzing health reform.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2009-022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19778929/,economics
"This study investigates the possible environmental effects of economic openness, such as economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, and trade liberalization in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. The study employed panel autoregressive lag distribution (ARDL) model to evaluate the environmental effects of economic openness; causality test was also conducted to confirm short- and long-run causality among the variables under discussion. The results show that trade, FDI, capital, and economic growth in the long run have a positive correlation with environmental degradation in SAARC countries while FDI, capital, and trade inflows have a negative relation with CO2 emissions in the short run. Furthermore, economic growth by creating new job opportunities improved emissions also in the short run. FDI, trade, capital, and GDP have long-run causality with CO2 emissions. Bidirectional causality was found between GDP and CO2 emissions, unidirectional causality was also running from FDI inflows to economic growth, unidirectional causality running from capital to FDI and trade to capital. Finally, trade and economic growth also have unidirectional causality in the short run. This study concludes, therefore, that SAARC countries should invest in green energy and promote green trade liberalization.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05750-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31236865/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Geographic transferability of economic evaluation data from one country to another has the potential to make a more efficient use of national and international evaluation resources. However, inappropriate transferability of economic data can provide misleading results and lead to an inefficient use of scarce health care resources.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to review, summarize and categorize the literature on: (i) factors affecting the geographic transferability of economic evaluation data; and (ii) approaches which have either been proposed or used for transferability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review on transferability was conducted. Electronic databases, hand searching and bibliographic searching techniques were utilized. Inclusion criteria for the review included conceptual or empirical papers with mention of factors affecting, or approaches for, transferability of economic evaluation data across geographic locations. Exclusion criteria included papers published prior to 1966, non-English language papers, pure science studies and animal studies. Three databases were involved in the primary search: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. In addition to the primary search, the Heath Economic Evaluation Database (OHE HEED), the NHS EED database and the EconLit databases were searched. Transferability factors were classified into major and minor categories, a classification of alternative transferability approaches was developed, and the number of empirical studies was catalogued according to this classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There is a substantial amount of literature on factors potentially affecting transferability. Based on these papers we identified 77 factors and subsequently developed a classification system which grouped these factors into five broad categories based on characteristics of the patient, the disease, the provider, the health care system and methodological conventions. Another 40 studies were identified which attempted to transfer economic evaluation data from one country to another and these were classified according to the sources for clinical efficacy, resource utilization and unit cost data.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is strong evidence indicating that transferability of economic evaluation data is a difficult and complex task. Approaches which have been used for transferability suggest that, at a minimum, there is a need for country-specific substitution of practice pattern data as well as unit cost data. A limitation of this review relates to the lack of empirical studies which prevents stronger conclusions regarding which transferability factors are most important to consider and under which circumstances.",https://doi.org/10.1185/030079906x167327,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17407623/,economics
"We describe the characteristics necessary for a plan for universal health insurance to find broad acceptance. Such a plan must represent incremental, not radical, change; must respect the preferences of voters, patients, and providers; must avoid major disruption in satisfactory existing arrangements; must avoid creating major windfall gains or losses; must avoid large-scale income redistribution; and must not be inflationary. Our proposal would create a framework that would encourage the efficient organization of care. Successful organizations would probably be those that attracted the loyalty and commitment of physicians, integrated insurance and the provision of care, and aligned the interests of doctors and patients toward high-quality, cost-effective care. The proposal's chief potential disadvantage would be its effect on the employment opportunities of low-wage workers, but this effect could be minimized. In addition, we discuss a proposal to mandate coverage by employers of full-time employees, legislation enacted recently in Massachusetts, high-risk pools, and the system followed in Canada, comparing each of these alternatives with our proposal.",https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198901123200205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2492082/,economics
"The strong and positive relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) and health expenditure is one of the most extensively explored topics in health economics. Since the global financial crisis, a variety of theories attempting to explain the slow recovery of the global economy have predicted that future economic growth will be slower than in the past. Others have increasingly questioned whether GDP growth is desirable or sustainable in the long term as evidence grows of humanity's impact on the natural environment. This paper reviews recent data on trends in global GDP growth and health expenditure. It examines a range of theories and scenarios concerning future global GDP growth prospects. It then considers the potential implications for health care systems and health financing policy of these different scenarios. In all cases, a core question concerns whether growth in GDP and/or growth in health expenditure in fact increases human health and well-being. Health care systems in low growth or 'post-growth' futures will need to be much more tightly focused on reducing overtreatment and low value care, reducing environmental impact, and on improving technical and allocative efficiency. This will require much more concerted policy and regulatory action to reduce industry rent-seeking behaviours.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133119000276,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31685052/,economics
"Objective:
        
      
      It is useful for reviewers of economic evaluations to assess quality in a manner that is consistent and comprehensive. Checklists can allow this, but there are concerns about their reliability and how they are used in practice. We aimed to describe how checklists have been used in systematic reviews of health economic evaluations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Meta-review with snowball sampling. We compiled a list of checklists for health economic evaluations and searched for the checklists' use in systematic reviews from January 2010 to February 2018. We extracted data regarding checklists used, stated checklist function, subject area, number of reviewers, and issues expressed about checklists.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found 346 systematic reviews since 2010 that used checklists to assess economic evaluations. The most common checklist in use was developed in 1996 by Drummond and Jefferson, and the most common stated use of a checklist was quality assessment. Checklists and their use varied within subject areas; 223 reviews had more than one reviewer who used the checklist.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Use of checklists is inconsistent. Eighteen individual checklists have been used since 2010, many of which have been used in ways different from those originally intended, often without justification. Different systematic reviews in the same subject areas would benefit from using one checklist exclusively, using checklists as intended, and having 2 reviewers complete the checklist. This would increase the likelihood that results are transparent and comparable over time.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.10.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30832977/,economics
"Many European and Asian economies are currently undergoing a process of economic transition away from state based command systems to market led economies. The impact of transition, such as a decline in public expenditure, break up of state enterprises and economic recession, has affected levels of funding available for social sectors. In the health sector, health insurance is being introduced as a way of alleviating the decline in funding arising from these processes. Most of the Former Soviet Union and a number of other Asian transition economies are currently introducing, extending or considering payroll based systems of health insurance. Comparisons with many Latin American countries, where social security based insurance has been encouraged since the first World War, can be illuminating. Experience suggests that, various factors have impeded or permitted development in these countries. General processes of economic change (transition factors) tend to affect all economies attempting to change the basis for public funding of services. Structural factors, such as urbanisation and the level of state or industrial employment, act as longer term inhibitors to the extension of coverage. These factors vary considerably across transition economies. This suggests that while a social security base for insurance may be a viable option for smaller industrialised European transitional economies, this is not the case for many of larger less industrialised economies. It is unclear how insurance will develop in the future. If a separate insurance fund is maintained it is important that its' purchasing function is developed. Otherwise it is not clear what value is added to the current health system. If entitlement is to be based on contribution, with the fund based on geographic or employment groups, systems for ensuring access for those not in employment and not classified as socially protected must be developed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00389-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10192555/,economics
"Wealth distribution has always been an important issue in our economic and social life, since it affects the harmony and stabilization of the society. Under the background of widely used financial tools to raise leverage these years, we studied the leverage effect on wealth distribution of a population in a controllable laboratory market in which we have conducted several human experiments, and drawn the conclusion that higher leverage leads to a higher Gini coefficient in the market. A higher Gini coefficient means the wealth distribution among a population becomes more unequal. This is a result of the ascending risk with growing leverage level in the market plus the diversified trading abilities and risk preference of the participants. This work sheds light on the effects of leverage and its related regulations, especially its impact on wealth distribution. It also shows the capability of the method of controllable laboratory markets which could be helpful in several fields of study such as economics, econophysics and sociology.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100681,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24968222/,economics
"Antibacterial drugs account for between 6 and 21% of the drug market in various countries, or between 3 and 25% of the total prescriptions. Given the high usage of these agents, they are appropriate candidates for economic appraisal in the near future. It is probable that the marketplace and healthcare reform will give managed care the dominant position in the US healthcare system. Cost-effectiveness analyses of managed care organisations are based on both hospital and outpatient costs, and they are increasingly being aimed at formulary decisions regarding pharmaceuticals. Appropriate outcome parameters, long term follow-up, and phase IV trials to determine costs and outcomes relating to actual clinical use are needed to assess cost-effectiveness. Unbiased pharmacoeconomic research is needed to accurately answer questions on the economic viability of new products, and to avoid scepticism on the part of the purchasers of healthcare.

"The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, 1.5 million people died, worldwide, from diarrheal diseases. A separate study estimated that 70% of diarrheal diseases are foodborne. The widely cited US estimate is that there are 76 million foodborne illnesses annually, resulting in 325,000 hospitalizations and 5200 deaths. However, there are epidemiologic and methodologic challenges to accurately estimate the economic burden of foodborne disease on society, either in terms of monetary costs or non-monetary units of measurement. Studies on the economic burden of foodborne disease vary considerably: some analyze the effects of a single pathogen or a single outbreak, whereas others attempt to estimate all foodborne disease in a country. Differences in surveillance systems, methodology, and other factors preclude meaningful comparisons across existing studies. However, if it were possible to completely estimate the societal costs for all acute foodborne diseases and their chronic sequelae worldwide, on the basis of currently available data, worldwide costs from these illnesses would be substantial. Moreover, foodborne infections are largely manifested as intestinal illnesses and are largely preventable. Total costs of foodborne disease would be much smaller in the United States and the world if economic incentives for industry to produce safer food were improved. However, costs of implementing new food safety prevention and control rules must be weighed against the estimated benefits of reducing foodborne disease to determine net benefits so that governments have information to efficiently allocate funds among competing programs.",https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2009.01.074,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19457414/,economics

"From a normative perspective, conventional economic analysis is often used to establish a framework in which social objectives can be built into the decision-making process. The health economics literature, however, tends to overlook the positive analysis of decision making--often assuming particular social objectives that may or may not correspond with reality. This perhaps explains why exercises in health economics priority setting on occasions break down. This study is a positive analysis of group decision making. It examines the process of deliberating upon proposed changes to funding arrangements across Divisions of General Practice in Queensland, Australia. Existing levels of funding had, for a number of years, largely been determined by an allocation formula. The motivation for this study was a perceived inequity created by the long-term under-funding of smaller (resource poor or 'marginal') Divisions. The challenge in this project was that any change in funding arrangements required the support of all the Divisions but also would potentially create 'winners' and 'losers'. Decision making within such an institutional context was rendered a zero sum game. This paper documents a consultative process whereby the relevant stakeholders, with clear interests in any decision, were asked to participate in deliberations as to how such a problem should be tackled. The objective was, in the face of adverse incentives, to derive recommendations for addressing existing shortfalls experienced by some of these Divisions. The process involved encouraging relevant players to take into consideration the global allocation issues and to move beyond their localised interests. The results indicate that such a process can be effective in not only generating the necessary goodwill to enable such group decision making, but also in establishing a more realistic set of policy recommendations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00368-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12791486/,economics
"This paper examines the organizational and financial changes experienced by the Chilean Health System in the last 20 years. The succession of widely different political and philosophical views sponsored by the governments of Frei, Allende and Pinochet and the marked economic fluctuations experienced in the last decade have affected the organization of health care financing and the allocation of resources among the population. The trend towards a completely state financed health care system was reversed in 1973. Pinochet's government explicitely included the private sector in the provision of public health services and assigned the State a subsidiary role. Several financing mechanisms created to coopt private capital into the health system are described as well as the evolution of private and public health care expenditures. The political and economic context that shapes the allocation of limited health care resources among a population with a highly unequal income distribution may endanger the access and the quality of health care services in the country.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(86)90137-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3083512/,economics

"Social health insurance in Western Europe has for many years been characterized by self-regulation in which specific conditions of healthcare financing and provision have been regulated by social-insurance institutions through mutual self-governance. However, the principle of self-regulation has recently been weakened by increased state regulation and market competition, which were introduced in response to economic and social changes. Even in Germany, which has been regarded as an ""ideal-type"" health insurance system and in which self-regulation remains at the core of healthcare governance, more direct state intervention has gained in importance. On the other hand, in countries such as Poland and Turkey, where this tradition of self-regulation is missing, social health insurance is deemed a financing instrument but not an instrument of governance and corporate actors are not accorded a significant role in regulation. This article investigates how social health insurance systems are regulated in contexts in which corporate actors' role is either diminishing or absent by focusing on three crucial areas of regulation: financing, the remuneration of medical doctors, and the definition of the healthcare benefit package. In Germany, state regulation has increased in healthcare financing and remuneration while the role of corporate actors has grown in the definition of the benefits package. In Poland and Turkey, on the other hand, reforms have maintained the status quo in terms of the strong regulatory, budgetary, and managerial powers of the state and very limited involvement of corporate actors.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.02.044,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23608097/,economics
"The main intention of health economic studies is to find out how to cope with the prevailing scarcity of resources. But scarcity is comparable to morbidity. As morbidity can not be finally cured by medical intervention, the problem of scarcity can only be solved relatively by economic research. It is evident, that the sensation of scarcity even aggravates with increasing prosperity. That is because human demands do in fact outrun economic potentials. The scarcity of resources therefore demands for setting of priorities. That is what economics in general and health economics in particular has set rules for. Priorities can be set by the state, the market or joint associations. The prevailing system in Germany is based on associations, the so called self-governing body. The scare financial resources are divided into budgets and allocated to service suppliers following predefined negotiation mechanisms within the joint self-administration. In recent years an increasing paternalism of the German government on the joint self-administration can be observed. Although Germany spends more on healthcare than ever before, the scarcity is noticed as threatening. The government currently interferes to cope with this problem. In opposition to that approach critics postulate more individual freedom in decisions for insurance holders, patients, health insurances and suppliers.

"Objective:
        
      
      Prior studies to determine the economic consequences of schizophrenia have largely been undertaken in clinical settings with a small number of cases and have been unable to analyze effects across different age cohorts. The aim of this study is to investigate the burden of schizophrenia in Germany.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Costs, service utilization, and premature mortality attributable to schizophrenia were estimated for the year 2008 using a retrospective matched cohort design. Therefore, 26,977 control subjects as well as 9411 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia were drawn from a sickness fund claims database. To reduce conditional bias, the non-parametric genetic matching method was employed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The final study population comprised 8224 matched pairs. The annual cost attributable to schizophrenia was €11,304 per patient from the payers' perspective and €20,609 from the societal perspective with substantial variations among age groups: direct medical expenses were highest among patients aged>65 years, whereas younger individuals (<25 years) incurred the greatest non-medical costs. The annual burden of schizophrenia from the perspective of German society ranges between €9.63 billion and €13.52 billion.
    


          Conclusion:

"Fee-for-service cannot be used successfully by organized health insurance without a fee schedule. America first tried to pay doctors under Medicare by an involved formula system without a fee schedule, but the effort has failed.

The primary goal is the same as that pursued recently by reformers in all countries: viz., narrow the spread in fees and income between surgical and cognitive fields. There are serious technical limitations on this effort, despite the talent of the research team. An additional difficulty lies in the nature of the subject: paying the doctor involves conflicts of interest between payers and all doctors as well as among the medical specialties, and the conflicts cannot be resolved by any formulae calculated by any single research team.

"Objectives:
        
      
      China has implemented the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural areas since 2003 to provide financial protection to its rural population. This article explores the effect of NCMS on relieving catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) among the poor and non-poor groups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A questionnaire survey was conducted in three counties, with a random sample of 358 poor and 523 non-poor NCMS enrollees who used inpatient services and obtained NCMS reimbursement in 2005.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Majority of NCMS enrollees suffered CHE because of using inpatient services; the occurrence and intensity of CHE was greater among poor inpatients. NCMS reimbursement helped relieve CHE to a certain degree. Poor inpatients benefited more from NCMS than non-poor, but the effects varied among counties. Cost control measures and other medical financial assistance (MFA) helped reduce inpatients' economic burden.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The objective of NCMS is only partly achieved. However, NCMS has promoted equity in health financing as poor inpatients can acquire more protection than the non-poor. Our analysis suggests that efforts should be made to improve NCMS design, strengthen cost containment and extend other MFA to further relieve economic burden of disease.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02469.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20180938/,economics
"Megamarketing, as coined by Kotler (1968), is a strategic way of thinking which takes an enlarged view of the skills and resources needed to enter and operate in obstructed or protected markets. The concept of megamarketing emphasizes the mastering and coordination of economic, psychological, political, and public relation skills and suggest that organizations can take a proactive stance in shaping macroenvironmental conditions. As health care delivery is characterized by a highly regulated environment, this marketing approach has definite applications for the health care marketer.",https://doi.org/10.1300/j026v07n01_03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10106844/,economics
"Our health care system is failing. Tens of millions of people are uninsured, costs are skyrocketing, and the bureaucracy is expanding. Patchwork reforms succeed only in exchanging old problems for new ones. It is time for basic change in American medicine. We propose a national health program that would (1) fully cover everyone under a single, comprehensive public insurance program; (2) pay hospitals and nursing homes a total (global) annual amount to cover all operating expenses; (3) fund capital costs through separate appropriations; (4) pay for physicians' services and ambulatory services in any of three ways: through fee-for-service payments with a simplified fee schedule and mandatory acceptance of the national health program payment as the total payment for a service or procedure (assignment), through global budgets for hospitals and clinics employing salaried physicians, or on a per capita basis (capitation); (5) be funded, at least initially, from the same sources as at present, but with all payments disbursed from a single pool; and (6) contain costs through savings on billing and bureaucracy, improved health planning, and the ability of the national health program, as the single payer for services, to establish overall spending limits.

"In recent years, most health care markets in the United States (US) have experienced rapid penetration by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). During this same period, the US has also experienced slowing health care costs. Using a national database, we demonstrate that HMOs and PPOs have significantly restrained cost growth among hospitals located in competitive hospital markets, but not so in the case of hospitals located in relatively concentrated markets. In relative terms, we estimate that HMOs have contained cost growth more effectively than PPOs.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199905)8:3<233::aid-hec406>3.0.co;2-x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10348418/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      In this era of rising healthcare costs, there is a growing interest in understanding how funding policies can be used to improve health and healthcare efficiency. Financial incentives (eg, vouchers or access to health insurance) or disincentives (eg, fines or out-of-pocket costs) affect behaviours. To date, reviews have explored the effects of financial (dis)incentives on patient health and behaviour by focusing on specific behaviours or geographical areas. The objective of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview on the use of financial (dis)incentives as a means of influencing health-related behaviour and costs in randomised trials.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      We will search electronic databases, clinical trial registries and websites of health economic organisations for randomised controlled trials. The initial searches, which were conducted on 13 January 2018, will be updated every 12 months until the completion of data analysis. The reference lists of included studies will be manually screened to identify additional eligible studies. Two researchers will independently review titles, abstracts and full texts to determine eligibility according to a set of predetermined inclusion criteria. Data will be extracted from included studies using a form developed and piloted by the research team. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      Ethics approval is not required since this is a review of published data. Results will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at relevant conferences.

"Patients who require long-term ventilator care in an acute care setting may have a problem because diagnosis-related group (DRG) payments are less than the cost of their medical care. An alternative for quality medical care at lower cost includes admission to a long-term ventilator facility. In Chicago, only two dedicated long-term ventilator programs exist, with only 33 beds. Within 50 to 150 miles of the immediate Chicago area are three more units, with only 42 operational beds. All of the long-term care beds are full, and over 50 patients await transfer. Since acute care is reimbursed on a DRG designation and long-term ventilator care has no DRG category, there is a bias in acute care settings against these patients. Medicare patients are reimbursed up to 100 days, after which patients become eligible for public aid. Unfortunately, long-term ventilator patients often wait in acute care settings for this 100 days to elapse, even though medical care may be superior in a long-term ventilator unit. In addition to not providing the best care, this situation is economically wasteful. Solutions to these problems will require a coordinated national, state, and local plan. National medical societies should be consulted regarding solutions to health care problems that provide the best medical care at a reasonable cost for patients on long-term ventilation.",https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.92.3.536,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3113835/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      We assess the annual economic burden of anxiety disorders in the United States from a societal perspective.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Using data from the National Comorbidity Study, we applied multivariate regression techniques to calculate the costs associated with anxiety disorders, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions. Based on additional data, in part from a large managed care organization, we estimated a human capital model of the societal cost of anxiety disorders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We estimated the annual cost of anxiety disorders to be approximately $42.3 billion in 1990 in the United States, or $1542 per sufferer. This comprises $23.0 billion (or 54% of the total cost) in nonpsychiatric medical treatment costs, S13.3 billion (31%) in psychiatric treatment costs, $4.1 billion (10%) in indirect workplace costs, $1.2 billion (3%) in mortality costs, and $0.8 billion (2%) in prescription pharmaceutical costs. Of the $256 in workplace costs per anxious worker, 88% is attributable to lost productivity while at work as opposed to absenteeism. Posttraumatic stress disorder and panic disorder are the anxiety disorders found to have the highest rates of service use. Other than simple phobia, all anxiety disorders analyzed are associated with impairment in workplace performance.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Anxiety disorders impose a substantial cost on society, much of which may be avoidable with more widespread awareness, recognition, and appropriate early intervention.",https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v60n0702,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10453795/,economics
"In developing countries, the noncommunicable disease (NCD) and risk factor burdens are shifting toward the poor. Treating chronic diseases can be expensive. In developing countries where generally much health care costs are borne by patients themselves, for those who live in poverty or recently escaped severe poverty, when faced with large, lifelong out-of-pocket expenses, impoverishment persists or can reoccur. These patterns have implications for national economic growth and poverty-reduction efforts. NCDs can change spending patterns dramatically and result in significantly reducing non-medical-related spending on food and education. In India, about 40% of household expenditures for treating NCDs are financed by households with distress patterns (borrowing and sales of assets). NCD short- and long-term disability can lead to a decrease in working-age population participation in the labor force and reduce productivity and, in turn, reduce per capita gross domestic product growth. To fully capitalize on the demographic dividend (i.e., aging of the population resulting in less dependent children, not yet more dependent elderly, and greater national productivity), healthy aging is necessary, which, in turn, requires effectively tackling NCDs. Last, from an equity standpoint, the economic effect of NCDs, evident at the household level and at the country level, will disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable populations in the developing world.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2011.601394,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21916715/,economics
"Decisions have to be made about allocating health resources. Currently the best economic evaluation method for doing this is cost-utility analysis. This compares the costs of different procedures with their outcomes measured in ""utility based"" units--that is, units that relate to a person's level of wellbeing. The most commonly used unit is the quality adjusted life year (QALY). QALYs are calculated by estimating the total life years gained from a procedure and weighting each year to reflect the quality of life in that year. To compare outcomes of different programmes the Rosser index is one measure that is widely used to assign quality of life scores to patients. Combined with a measure of life years gained from a procedure, this enables QALYs to be calculated and procedures ranked according to cost per QALY gained. In this article Ray Robinson explains the measures used and discusses how QALY league tables can be used to guide decisions on resource allocation.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.307.6908.859,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8401133/,economics
"Economic evaluation supports decision making in health care in view of alternative courses of action and limited resources. It aims at providing maximum benefit in relation to invested resources. In the context of screening, it is required from an economical viewpoint that the cost of case finding, including confirmatory diagnostic tests and treatment, should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole. Costs of false-positive findings are crucial in newborn screening and pertain to direct costs (e.g. necessary diagnostic work-up), indirect costs (e.g. absence from work of parents) and intangible costs (e.g. anxiety and distress caused, stigmatisation).",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-003-1341-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595558/,economics
"This article reviews employers' attempts over the past 25 years to address the cost and accessibility of health care services for their employees and the effect these efforts have had on U.S. health care delivery. The difficulties in aligning the interests of all parties in a third-party health beneficiary contract are examined. Many employers are considering consumer-driven health care plans as an alternative to managed care plans to both control health care costs and improve employee satisfaction. Such plans differ from fee-for-service and managed care models in terms of the economic alignment of the parties. Consumer-driven plans align the employer's economic interest with the employee/patient, and reduce health benefit costs by providing information, tools, and direct economic incentives to employees for self-management of health care dollars. Because these incentives are designed to reduce the consumption of services, providers are the party left out of economic alignment under the consumer-driven model.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0002-9610(03)00189-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885601/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Economic resources are limited in health care, and governance strategies are used to push provider organizations to use resources efficiently. Although studies show that hybrid managers are successful in reconciling economic efficiency requirements with professional values to meet patient needs, surprisingly few studies focus on staff. The aim of this study is to explore staff members' experience of economic efficiency requirements.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A mixed method design was applied, targeting multi-professional staff in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine in a Swedish university hospital. Survey data was collected (n = 93), followed by focus-group interviews to support the understanding of the quantitative findings.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The findings show that health care staff is knowledgeable and intrinsically motivated to consider efficiency requirements, albeit it should not dominate clinical decisions. However, staff experiences little influence over resource allocation and identifies limitations in the system's abilities to meet patient needs. Staff experience incorporates a local unit and a system perspective.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Staff members are aware of economic efficiency requirements and will behave accordingly if patients are not at risk. However, their engagement seems to rely on how economic efficiency requirements are handled at multiple system levels and their trust in the system to fairly support patient needs.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31090970/,economics
"Given the high costs of innovative new drugs, most European countries have introduced policies for price control, in particular value-based pricing (VBP) and international reference pricing. The purpose of this study is to describe how profit-maximizing manufacturers would optimally adjust their launch sequence to these policies and how VBP countries may best respond. To decide about the launching sequence, a manufacturer must consider a tradeoff between price and sales volume in any given country as well as the effect of price in a VBP country on the price in international reference pricing countries. Based on the manufacturer's rationale, it is best for VBP countries in Europe to implicitly collude in the long term and set cost-effectiveness thresholds at the level of the lowest acceptable VBP country. This way, international reference pricing countries would also converge towards the lowest acceptable threshold in Europe.",https://doi.org/10.1586/14737167.2015.972374,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25327543/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      Within health economic studies, it is often necessary to adjust costs obtained from different time periods for inflation. Nevertheless, many studies do not report the methods used for this in sufficient detail. In this article, we outline the principal methods used to adjust for inflation, with a focus on studies relating to healthcare interventions in low- and middle-income countries. We also discuss issues relating to converting local currencies to international dollars and US$ and adjusting cost data collected from other countries or previous studies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We outlined the 3 main methods used to adjust for inflation for studies in these settings: exchanging the local currency to US$ or international dollars and then inflating using US inflation rates (method 1); inflating the local currency using local inflation rates and then exchanging to US$ or international dollars (method 2); splitting the costs into tradable and nontradable resources and using method 1 on the tradable resources and method 2 on the nontradable resources (method 3).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In a hypothetical example of adjusting a cost of US$100 incurred in Vietnam from 2006 to 2016 prices, the adjusted cost from the 3 methods were US$116.84, US$172.09, and US$161.04, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The different methods for adjusting for inflation can yield substantially different results. We make recommendations regarding the most appropriate method for various scenarios. Moving forward, it is vital that studies report the methodology they use to adjust for inflation more transparently.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.03.021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31511179/,economics
"The health system of the United States is in a paradoxical position. At its best, the system is a magnet for those seeking the latest technical breakthroughs. It can offer that excellence because there have never been effective financial constraints on the imagination; the system has become a major economic frontier, at which professional and other entrepreneurs successfully seek their fortune. At the same time, the system is leaving increasing numbers of Americans frustrated and disillusioned. It is beset by excess capacity in many areas, is needlessly expensive, and often bestows unnecessary health services. Yet only the experts are aware of these flaws; most Americans still express high satisfaction with the quality of the services they receive from their doctors and hospitals. The public's major misgivings arise over the awkward and inequitable way in which American health care is financed. The typical private health insurance policy, for example, is tied to a particular job. If the job is lost, so is the health insurance. Furthermore, these policies are priced on actuarially ""fair"" principles, so sick individuals are forced to pay higher insurance premiums than relatively healthy ones and chronically ill persons often cannot obtain health insurance coverage at any price. Although there are public programs to catch many persons not privately insured, the coverage tends to be insufficiently extensive and deep. Some 35 million Americans, mostly poor, have no health insurance whatsoever. Unfortunately, at this time there is no political force in the United States strong enough to reform the American health system toward greater social equity and economic efficiency, whereas there are numerous groups powerful enough to block whatever reform might harm their own narrow economic interests. Other nations can learn from America's clinical and organizational innovations in health care delivery. They can also learn what not to do by studying the unseemly way in which American health care is financed.",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-17-4-637,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1299684/,economics
"The non-homothetic production cost structure in Norwegian private dentistry involves more than two factor inputs. Consequently, this paper implements-separately for solo and group practices-three conceptually different measures of factor substitutions to infer the precise nature of input associations using translog cost model estimates based on 1993 data. We calculate own- and cross-price elasticities of factor demands, pairwise elasticities of substitution and their approximate S.E.s. We find that: (1) dentists and dental assistants cannot be consistently aggregated as one homogeneous labour input; (2) input demands are inelastic; (3) the theoretically restrictive Allen-Uzawa and the less restrictive shadow and Morishima elasticities of substitution are not equivalent; (4) dentists and auxiliary dental personnel relate as significant substitutes in solo practices and as significant complements in group practices; (5) 'supplies' (e.g., dental materials) in the aggregate are substitutes for the two types of dentistry labour; and (6) there appears to be a wider scope for factor substitutions in group rather than solo practices. Due to inelastic factor demands, opportunities for cost controls are limited despite some tendencies for factor interchange. Finally, future researchers of production costs involving more than two inputs should investigate the less restrictive, alternative measures of factor substitutions.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199905)8:3<221::aid-hec408>3.0.co;2-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10348417/,economics
"Background: Health-care systems in Asian countries are diverse. The economic evaluation provides information on how to make efficient use of the resources available to obtain the maximum benefits. In Asia, diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus (DM), tuberculosis (TB) and epilepsy generate a heavy economic burden. The objective of this article is to provide a review of the economic burden of health to patients in Asian countries. Areas covered: All data were collected from already published research article and review papers. The databases searched were Science Direct, PubMed, MEDLINE and Google scholar. We found a total of 4456 articles on health economics. After reviewing the title, only 876 relevant articles were considered. Only 92 (n = 92) articles were considered on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Expert opinion: Available data give evidence that diseases are linked to the low socio-economic status of the Asian population. The cost per capita is high in Asian countries due to insufficient health-care facilities. The cost per capita in Asian countries ranges from $23 (Pakistan) to $1775 (Taiwan). The per capita cost of Malaysia, China, Singapore, and Thailand is $27 $83, $75, and $27, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2019.1650643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31401898/,economics
"Third party payers' decision processes for financing health technologies ('fourth hurdle' processes) are subject to intensive descriptive empirical investigation. This paper addresses the need for a theoretical foundation of this research and develops a theoretical framework for analysing fourth hurdle processes from an economics perspective. On the basis of a decision-analytic framework and the theory of agents, fourth hurdle processes are described as sets of institutions to maximize the value derived from finite healthcare resources. Benefits are assumed to arise from the value of better information about and better implementation of the most cost-effective choice. Implementation is improved by decreased information asymmetries and better alignment of incentives. This decreases the effects of ex ante and ex post moral hazard on service provision. Potential indicators of high benefit include high costs associated with wrong decisions and large population sizes affected by the decision. The framework may serve as a basis both for further theoretical work, for example, on the appropriate degree of participation as well as further empirical work, for example, on comparative assessments of fourth hurdle processes. It needs to be complemented by frameworks for analysing fourth hurdle institutions developed by other disciplines such as bioethics or law.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.2830,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22544431/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The past decades have seen rapid advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In particular, the introduction of biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have improved clinical outcomes and reconfigured traditional RA cost compositions.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To map the existing evidence concerning cost of illness of RA, as the treatment pathway evolves in the biologic era, and examine how costs have been measured and estimated, in order to assemble and appropriately interpret available data.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic review of studies that estimated the costs of patients with RA. Multiple electronic databases were searched to identify studies published between 2000 and 2019. The reported total costs and cost components were evaluated according to the study and population characteristics. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to determine statistically significant trends in increasing or decreasing proportions over time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 72 studies were included. Drug costs compromised the main component (up to 87%) of direct costs with an increasing trajectory over time, although not statistically significant. The proportion of costs for hospitalisation showed a statistically significant decrease chronologically (p=0.044). Indirect costs, primarily associated with absenteeism and work disability accounted for 39% to 86% of total costs. The reported indirect costs are highly sensitive to the approach to estimation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A decreasing trend in inpatient costs chronologically suggested a cost shift in other components of direct costs. Indirect costs still contributed a considerable proportion of total costs, with work disability being the main cost component. Economic analyses that do not incorporate or appropriately measure indirect costs will underestimate the full economic impact of RA.",https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2019-216243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32245893/,economics

      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents the most common subset of cardiovascular heart diseases and relates to high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide and, consequently, to both the direct and indirect costs to the health system and society. Given the rising healthcare costs combined with budgetary constraints, health care systems and decision makers are faced with challenging decisions and the need to choose alternative treatments that not only improve patient quantity and quality of life but are also economically attractive.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To systematically review the published literature and to identify studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of different treatments for patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      A literature search was performed using PubMed and the Cochrane Library until October 2013, with no limit on publication date.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      The search was conducted using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, limiting articles to those published in the English language and those reporting results of economic evaluations [i.e. cost-effectiveness (CEA), cost-utility (CUA) cost-minimisation (CMA) cost-consequence (CCA) and cost-benefit (CBA) analyses] of the different treatment therapies used for managing patients presenting with NSTE-ACS. Publications such as editorials, letters to the editor, posters, expert opinions, reviews, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses were excluded.
    


          Study appraisal methods:
        
      
      All studies included were assessed for their methodological quality using the British Medical Journal checklist.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 39 studies were included, presenting a wide variation in terms of methodological approaches and settings, thus resulting in different ranges of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each treatment evaluated.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Evidence from the present systematic review suggests that the majority of the available treatments represent either cost-saving or cost-effective options for NSTE-ACS patients. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of the available treatments was found to be dependent on various factors, particularly the risk profile of patients and the cost of treatment, and hence there is a need to take these into consideration when making decisions and choices.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-014-0191-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082388/,economics

Most available economic and clinical data, especially data documenting post-therapy outcomes, are from small, short term studies. This has led to the use of modelling to estimate which determinants can improve the quality and cost effectiveness of HIV care in the future. Although the attempt to provide what is currently perceived to be the standard of care is stretching many healthcare budgets, it is an anachronism that there are few studies of health economics in HIV disease.

"The reasons commonly given for discounting future costs and benefits are doubtfully applicable to future injuries: in particular, time preference justifies neither inter- nor intragenerational discounting. The cost of future injuries could be discounted on grounds that a smaller sum, invested at interest, is needed to pay a given level of ex post monetary compensation the further in the future the injury occurs. This effect is offset, however, by the diminishing marginal utility of compensation, if consumption is otherwise increasing. Depending on the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, on whether consumption is growing at an optimal rate, and on the time period considered, the implicit discount rate may be positive, zero, or negative (even indefinitely so). There is no prospect of conventional discounting dealing appropriately with the cost of injuries to either future or present generations.",https://doi.org/10.1111/0272-4332.206077,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11314733/,economics
"Current funding mechanisms can impede the efficient use and integration of telemedicine services. Telemedicine has developed in Australia against a background of complex funding arrangements and interwoven health-care responsibilities. These impediments are not unique to telemedicine but are accentuated by its ability to cover different locations, clinical areas and purposes. There is also a link between economic evaluation and funding mechanisms for telemedicine. While economic evaluations provide important information for the efficient allocation of resources, the funding environment in which telemedicine is established is also crucial in ensuring that services are efficient. Given these complexities, should telemedicine be funded? We conclude that this will depend on: the objectives and priorities of the health system; the efficiency of telemedicine relative to that of other forms of health-care delivery; and the funding environment. In terms of resource allocation processes, the optimum scenario is likely to be where the decision to invest in telemedicine services is made taking local needs into account, but where considerations such as market structure and network compatibility are examined on a broader scale and balanced against the principles of efficiency and equity.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x0200800501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12396851/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Value-based medicine (VBM) unifies costs and patient-perceived value (improvement in quality of life, length of life, or both) of an intervention. Value-based ophthalmology is of increasing importance for decisions in eye care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The methods of VBM are explained and definitions for a specific terminology in this field are given. The cost-utility analysis as part of health care economic analyses is explained.
    


          Results:
        
      
      VBM exceeds evidence-based medicine by incorporating parameters of cost and benefits from an ophthalmological intervention. The benefit of the intervention is defined as an increase or maintenance of visual quality of life and can be determined by utility analysis. The time trade-off method is valid and reliable for utility analysis. The resources expended for the value gained in VBM are measured with cost-utility analysis in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life years gained (euros/QALY). Numerous cost-utility analyses of different ophthalmological interventions have been published.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The fundamental instrument of VBM is cost-utility analysis. The results in cost per QALY allow estimation of cost effectiveness of an ophthalmological intervention. Using the time trade-off method for utility analysis allows the comparison of ophthalmological cost-utility analyses with those of other medical interventions. VBM is important for individual medical decision making and for general health care.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00347-006-1340-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16763866/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      This review will describe the basic concepts of economic evaluation, using examples from the ophthalmic literature. The aim is to provide readers with knowledge about the fundamentals of economic evaluation to enable them to read papers critically, make healthcare funding and planning decisions, and understand the economic evaluation of interventions.
    


          Review:
        
      
      Ophthalmic services are often constrained by a lack of funding, and this is true in both high- and low-income countries. Ophthalmology also competes with other healthcare specialities for funding. Economic evaluation is used to identify the most efficient way of allocating and planning the use of these scarce resources among alternative activities. An economic evaluation is typically conducted by comparing two or more interventions in terms of their effectiveness and their cost. Cost is the value of all resources used in the intervention. Effects, or consequences of the intervention, can be measured in monetary terms, through disease-specific outcomes or using health-related quality of life measures. The four most commonly used types of economic evaluations are cost-minimization analysis, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis. There are a variety of intended and unintended consequences of a health intervention, and so the consequences of the intervention may be positive or negative. Economic models, such as decision trees and Markov models, calculate effectiveness and costs, taking into account all the consequences of the intervention, including complications. Uncertainties in the parameters of the models can be expressed through sensitivity analyses and confidence intervals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economic evaluation may be used to identify the most efficient way of allocating scarce resources among alternative activities. Its use, if standardized in all areas, can improve the quality of care while enhancing efficiency and thereby enabling more programs to be funded.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09286580600760539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17169853/,economics
"During a recession, cost-sharing of employer-sponsored health benefits could increase to reduce labor costs in the U.S. Using a variation in the severity of recession shocks across industries, I find evidence that the enrollment rate of high deductible health plans (HDHPs) among workers covered by employer-sponsored health benefits increased more among firms in industries that experienced severe recession shocks. As potential mechanisms, I study employer-side and worker-side mechanisms. I find that employers changed health benefit offerings to force or incentivize workers to enroll in HDHPs. But I find little evidence of an increase in workers' demand for HDHPs due to a reduction in income. These results suggest that the HDHP enrollment rate increased during the Great Recession, as employers tried to save costs of offering health benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2018.01.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29408152/,economics

"Economic evaluations of health care programmes and treatments have now been conducted for about 30 years. A number of key methodological principles have been specified and there has been an exponential rise in the number of published studies. However, there is relatively little evidence of the use of these studies in decision making about health technologies. Therefore, this paper considers what policy issues are amenable to economic analysis, or could be greatly informed by economic appraisal results. It is concluded that a wide range of mechanisms exist to influence the diffusion and use of health technologies and that economic appraisal is potentially applicable to a number of them. The paper also considers how economic appraisal could be made more relevant to decision making. It is concluded that methodological standards need to be maintained, that evidence needs to be produced in a timely fashion, that the local validity of study results needs to be increased, that the dissemination of study results needs to be improved and that more note needs to be taken of the available policy instruments.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(94)90059-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8047916/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Ghana has made impressive progress against malaria, decreasing mortality and morbidity by over 50% between 2005 and 2015. These gains have been facilitated in part, due to increased financial commitment from government and donors. Total resources for malaria increased from less than USD 25 million in 2006 to over USD 100 million in 2011. However, the country still faces a high burden of disease and is at risk of declining external financing due to its strong economic growth and the consequential donor requirements for increased government contributions. The resulting financial gap will need to be met domestically. The purpose of this study was to provide economic evidence of the potential risks of withdrawing financing to shape an advocacy strategy for resource mobilization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A compartmental transmission model was developed to estimate the impact of a range of malaria interventions on the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria between 2018 and 2030. The model projected scenarios of common interventions that allowed the attainment of elimination and those that predicted transmission if interventions were withheld. The outputs of this model were used to generate costs and economic benefits of each option.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Elimination was predicted using the package of interventions outlined in the national strategy, particularly increased net usage and improved case management. Malaria elimination in Ghana is predicted to cost USD 961 million between 2020 and 2029. Compared to the baseline, elimination is estimated to prevent 85.5 million cases, save 4468 lives, and avert USD 2.2 billion in health system expenditures. The economic gain was estimated at USD 32 billion in reduced health system expenditure, increased household prosperity and productivity gains. Through malaria elimination, Ghana can expect to see a 32-fold return on their investment. Reducing interventions, predicted an additional 38.2 clinical cases, 2500 deaths and additional economic losses of USD 14.1 billion.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Malaria elimination provides robust epidemiological and economic benefits, however, sustained financing is need to accelerate the gains in Ghana. Although government financing has increased in the past decade, the amount is less than 25% of the total malaria financing. The evidence generated by this study can be used to develop a robust domestic strategy to overcome the financial barriers to achieving malaria elimination in Ghana.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-020-03267-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32487148/,economics

      The COVID-19 virus impacts human health and the world economy, causing in Peru, more than 800 thousand infected and a strong recession expressed in a drop of -12% in its economic growth rate for 2020. In this context, the objective of the study is to analyze the dynamics of the short-term behavior of economic activity, as well as to explain the causal relationships in a Pandemic context based on the basic number of spread (Re) of COVID-19 per day.
    


          Methods:

"Background:
        
      
      There is growing concern about the economic impact of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Brazil and worldwide.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the economic impact of CVD in Brazil in the last five years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The information to estimate CVD costs was taken from national databases, adding the direct costs with hospitalizations, outpatient visits and benefits granted by social security. Indirect costs were added to the calculation, such as loss of income caused by CVD morbidity or mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CVD mortality accounts for 28% of all deaths in Brazil in the last five years and for 38% of deaths in the productive age range (18 to 65 years). The estimated costs of CVD were R$ 37.1 billion in 2015, a 17% increase in the period from 2010 to 2015. The estimated costs of premature death due to CVD represent 61% of the total cost of CVD, Direct costs with hospitalizations and consultations were 22%, and costs related to the loss of productivity related to the disease were 15% of the total. Health expenditures in Brazil are estimated at 9.5% of GDP and the average cost of CVD was estimated at 0.7% of GDP.

      CVD costs have increased significantly in the last five years. It is estimated that CVD costs increase as the Brazilian population ages and the prevalence of CVD increases.",https://doi.org/10.5935/abc.20170068,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28591251/,economics
"Background and purpose:
        
      
      Stroke is a debilitating disease with long-term social and economic consequences. As new therapies for acute ischemic stroke are forthcoming, there is an increasing need to understand their long-term economic implications. To address this need, a stroke economic model was created.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The model consists of 3 modules. A short-term module incorporates short-term clinical trial data. A long-term module composed of several Markov submodels predicts patient transitions among various locations over time. The modules are connected via a bridge component that groups the survivors at the end of the short-term module according to their functional status and location. Examples of analyses that can be conducted with this model are provided with the use of data from 2 international trials. For illustration, UK unit costs were estimated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      With the trial data in the short-term module, the short-term management cost is estimated to be pound8326 (US $13,649 [USD]). Hospital stay was the major cost driver. By the end of the trials, there was a pronounced difference in the distribution of patient locations between functional groups. It is predicted in the long-term module that the subsequent cost amounts to pound75 985 (124,564 USD) for a major and pound27,995 (45,893 USD) for a minor stroke.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Linking functional recovery at the end of short-term treatment with patients' treatment and residential locations allows this model to estimate the long-term economic impact of stroke interventions. Using patient location instead of the more common natural history as the model foundation allows quantification of the long-term impact to become data driven and hence increases confidence in the results.",https://doi.org/10.1161/01.str.30.12.2574,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10582980/,economics

Secondly, in the healthcare environment, we pay particular attention to models that include new arguments on professionals' objective duties or to bargaining models when there is asymmetric information. Finally, we consider the medical malpractice insurance market and investigate how reputation and the possibilities of exercising defensive medicine influence healthcare provision.

"The choice of a perspective is among the most critical influences of the potential outcome of an economic evaluation, since it determines whose interest is relevant in any given analysis. For publicly funded programmes such as Medicaid, and now Medicare, it is important that economic evaluations are undertaken from a societal perspective because such evaluations inform decisions about allocation of healthcare resources. It has been argued that approaches other than the societal perspective selectively include specific costs, while ignoring other costs that are very much more 'real', and hence lack theoretical foundation in welfare economics. In view of the importance of perspectives in economic evaluations, this paper reviews 25 existing reports of economic evaluations of interventions involving prescription drugs in the Medicaid programme to examine the perspectives employed in such evaluations, based on the specific cost and benefit measurements. No explicit statement of the perspective employed was included in any of the articles selected for this review. Based on an analysis of the cost measures, none of the studies were found to have adopted a societal perspective in their evaluation. Most studies were from the perspective of Medicaid as the payer and as such did not include costs and benefits from outside the Medicaid system. Ten of the identified evaluations of interventions focused just on costs related to prescription drugs. Six studies included an evaluation of the impact of the intervention on overall programme costs along with the costs of prescription drugs. The nine remaining evaluations employed a broader approach to include related effects of the drug-benefit intervention on costs and utilization of other healthcare services such as physician, outpatient and inpatient services. This review emphasizes the importance of a societal approach in evaluating the effects of interventions in Medicaid and other publicly funded drug benefit programmes. Existing evaluations fall short of employing such a broad perspective. This, along with the limitations in design and data, make findings from these studies less reliable than should be used to make major decisions regarding allocation of tax dollars. While methodological challenges to such an approach are valid and understandable, there is an increasing need to attempt evaluations of cost-containment strategies from a broad-based societal perspective to ensure continuity and sustainability of publicly funded drug benefit programmes such as Medicaid and Medicare.",https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200826040-00002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18370564/,economics
"The United Kingdom led the world in transforming the largest single health care system from a publicly administered service to a set of interlocking contracts. Policy lessons that can be adapted by employers, nations, and other large payers are identified. These lessons are drawn from the improvements that the British made over the design of managed competition, the mistakes and problems they experienced, the underlying trends toward privatization and class discrimination, and the limitations to competition that have led the British toward managed cooperation in collaborative purchasing for the health needs of communities. Yet market reform and the rhetoric of efficiency have justified the shrinking of health services, the shift of costs to household budgets, and the use of public moneys to support private services and investors at greater expense by moving properties and services off the public ledger. In these ways, managed competition can Americanize health care and pose fundamental questions about what policy goals are really being pursued.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.00058,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9290632/,economics

The model captures the features of the actual stock price that are consistent with the empirical evidence on the sustainability of stock price fluctuations.

"Objective:
        
      
      The overarching question addressed in this article is: what has been the impact of economic evidence to Canadian drug reimbursement decisions; within this, has an (explicit or implicit) threshold been identified for making such decisions; and is the impact or threshold different for oncology medications?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three sequential strategies were employed: a literature search, a review of publicly available Canadian reimbursement recommendations, and a one-day key informant roundtable, held with a purposive sample of 13 individuals from across Canada to gain information not readily accessible from the public domain.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Despite the formal requirement for structured economic evidence, the limited public information suggests that its uptake in the Canadian decision-making process has been tentative. Implicit economic thresholds have been published in Australia and the United Kingdom, but not in Canada. Based on reviews of reimbursement recommendations, thresholds specific to oncology medications may be higher than for nononcology medications, in Canada and elsewhere. Canadian reimbursement recommendations can appear inconsistent with respect to clinical evidence, economic evidence, and nonevidentiary factors, possibly because of a lack of transparency or context-sensitive interpretations. The key informant roundtable provided reasons for the inconsistent uptake of economic evidence: panelists were divided between those who found economic information useful and supportive to decision-making, and those who did not. Panelists generally agreed on the need for publicly defensible and ethical reimbursement restrictions. They suggested the following improvements: transparency of processes and decisions, dynamic formularies that can adapt with evolving treatment practices and clinical data, broader representation of expertise on review panels, greater use of ethics to resolve conflicts arising from different perspectives, and the development of an explicit Canadian weighting system for evidence and values.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economic evidence has been tentatively incorporated in reimbursement decision-making in Canada. Public reasons for recommendation indicate that this evidence is used primarily with respect to the attractiveness of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Oncology drugs seem to be adopted at the highest thresholds of acceptability. Yet, decision-makers expressed a need to move beyond lambda, rejecting the simplicity of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and considering alternative strategies to improve decision-making, including formal guidance for weighting both evidence and values.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00298.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18179658/,economics
"The value added by acute-care hospitals is in the form of specific procedures (therapy, operations, testing) and the bed care necessary to make the procedures effective. When more than one hospital exists in a local area (defined in many studies as a radius of 15 mi/24 km) they compete for market share, since greater market share has a positive effect on economies of scale, utilization rates, learning curves and levels of quality. Competition is not only with other hospitals (and 75% of all hospitals do have a competitor within 24 km), but also with doctors who now perform some procedures in their offices, and with specialized clinics. The first strategy is to attract physician allegiance since they act as gate-keepers, directing patients to specific hospitals. This is done through personal amenities, professional amenities and enhancement to personal prestige and income. This competition for physician allegiance has a direct effect on utilization rates (doctors want spare capacity to suit their needs), on the range of services and facilities offered (doctors want more support), and on length of stay (doctors want longer stays). All of these increase the hospital's costs. The second strategy is to enter into contracts with third-party payers who will direct their clients to specific or preferred hospitals. The negative effect is that in competitive markets such payers may be able to bargain prices down. However, hospital differentiation makes it difficult for payers to make complete substitutions among them. As well, since the payers compete for clients, they often use hospital alliances as a selling point and therefore are often cooperative rather than confrontational in their negotiations. One tactic used by hospitals is to stress quality of service. But since quality in health care is hard to measure, patients are often unable to make direct assessments of alternatives. Hospitals therefore often 'signal' quality in various ways which may, and often do, increase hospital costs. (Some of these signals also attract physicians). Price is not a major element in competition. Most other strategies and tactics raise hospital costs and therefore price. Pressure from payers is turned back through differentiation (preventing substitution) and hospital-payer alliances for clients. Health care comes in too many packages to allow effective price competition. A final tactic is to increase the range of services or facilities offered. Enhanced services attract doctors by offering more support; attract some patients direct; and help to recapture market share lost to specialized clinics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8510(94)90117-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10134580/,economics
"The factors that have contributed to an overhaul of German hospital policy in the last 12 months are both numerous and highly interrelated. Rising health expenditures and inflexible mechanisms for implementing hospital policy are major culprits, as are the considerably changed political and economic circumstances over the last 15 years. Although this overhaul does embody some changes in the direction of German health care policy, they can best be understood as a further manifestation of the continuity that has characterized policy in this area for the past 100 years; a continuity rooted in the widely shared belief that disease, whatever its nature, is beyond the control of individuals. The key to cost containment is considered to lie in the reduction of the average length of stay and in the better utilization of hospital facilities. Payment remains directly related neither to specific diagnoses of individual patients nor to occupancy rates in individual departments, which vary greatly across disciplines and specialities. In the era that is unfolding, one political phenomenon requires close watching in the future: policy coalitions at the Land-level will become even more important as prime movers than they have been in the past. Demands for Strukturreform are a regular feature of many governmental systems. Yet the capacity of political bodies--whether ministries or parliaments--is severely limited by the distribution of power and control over resources and by the political dynamics which they generate. In the FRG, major reforms will not take place until after the 1987 federal elections, and it is essential to remember that the realms of campaign rhetoric and of policy choice and implementation are governed by entirely different sets of rules and constraints.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.4740010304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10279374/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      To review the literature of economic evaluations regarding diagnostic methods used in dentistry.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Four databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, The Cochrane library, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database) were searched for studies, complemented by hand search, until February 2013.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      Two authors independently screened all titles or abstracts and then applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to select full-text publications published in English, which reported an economic evaluation comparing at least two alternative methods. Studies of diagnostic methods were assessed by four reviewers using a protocol based on the QUADAS tool regarding diagnostic methods and a check-list for economic evaluations. The results of the data extraction were summarized in a structured table and as a narrative description.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 476 identified full-text publications, 160 were considered to be economic evaluations. Only 12 studies (7%) were on diagnostic methods, whilst 78 studies (49%) were on prevention and 70 (40%) on treatment. Among studies on diagnostic methods, there was between-study heterogeneity methodologically, regarding the diagnostic method analysed and type of economic evaluation addressed. Generally, the choice of economic evaluation method was not justified and the perspective of the study not stated. Costing of diagnostic methods varied.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A small body of literature addresses economic evaluation of diagnostic methods in dentistry. Thus, there is a need for studies from various perspectives with well defined research questions and measures of the cost and effectiveness.
    


          Clinical significance:
        
      
      Economic resources in healthcare are finite. For diagnostic methods, an understanding of efficacy provides only part of the information needed for evidence-based practice. This study highlighted a paucity of economic evaluations of diagnostic methods used in dentistry, indicating that much of what we practise lacks sufficient evidence.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2014.07.018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25108229/,economics
"Even though many employers believe that health insurance and health affect employees' productivity and firms' performance, health economists typically overlook and rarely measure firms' returns on health-related investments. Some research, however, suggests that firms may benefit economically by providing health insurance coverage for workers and their families. For example, health coverage may help employers recruit and retain high-quality workers. Health may contribute to productivity by reducing the costs of absenteeism and turnover and by increasing workers' productivity. This article reviews the evidence and proposes an agenda for future research. A better understanding of the benefits to employers of offering health coverage to workers may help clarify employers' behavior and help private employers and public officials make appropriate investments in health.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.00037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12669650/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Due to demographic aging, economic evaluation of health care technologies for the elderly becomes more important. A standardised questionnaire to measure the health-related resource utilisation has been designed. The monetary valuation of the resource use documented by the questionnaire is a central step towards the determination of the corresponding costs. The aim of this paper is to provide unit costs for the resources in the questionnaire from a societal perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The unit costs are calculated pragmatically based on regularly published sources. Thus, an easy update is possible.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This paper presents the calculated unit costs for outpatient medical care, inpatient care, informal and formal nursing care and pharmaceuticals from a societal perspective.

"Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the societal economic burden and the governmental budgetary impact of the following visual disorders among US adults aged 40 years and older: visual impairment, blindness, refractive error, age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and primary open-angle glaucoma.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We estimated 3 components of economic burden: direct medical costs, other direct costs, and productivity losses. We used private insurance and Medicare claims data to estimate direct medical costs; epidemiologic evidence from multiple published sources to estimate other direct costs, such as nursing home costs; and data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to estimate productivity losses. We used budgetary documents and our direct medical and other direct cost estimates to approximate the governmental budgetary impact.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We estimated that the annual total financial burden of major adult visual disorders is $35.4 billion ($16.2 billion in direct medical costs, $11.1 billion in other direct costs, and $8 billion in productivity losses) and that the annual governmental budgetary impact is $13.7 billion.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Major visual disorders among Americans older than 40 years result in substantial economic costs for the US economy.

"Background:
        
      
      Given the high costs of delivering care to critically ill patients, practitioners and policymakers are beginning to scrutinize the costs and outcomes associated with intensive care. Health economics is a discipline concerned with determining the best way of using resources to maximize the health of the community. This involves addressing questions such as which procedure, test, therapy, or program should be provided, and to whom, given available resources.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this article is to review general economic principles that will help intensivists to better interpret published economic evaluations.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Selected articles from the health economics and critical care literature.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In this article, we use an economic evaluation that examines sedation strategies in critically ill patients. We discuss how learning to critically appraise an economic evaluation is only part of the task for end users. Determining whether and how to apply the results of economic evaluations to local settings presents bigger challenges and remains largely a matter of judgment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Economic evaluations use analytic techniques to systematically consider all possible costs and consequences of clinical actions. Although they should never form the sole basis for clinical decisions for individual patients, economic evaluations offer potentially useful information at different levels of decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00003246-199906000-00052,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10397229/,economics
"Many public and private healthcare payers use formularies as a tool for controlling drug costs and quality. Although the price per dose is often negotiated as part of the formulary listing, payers may still face unlimited financial risk if demand is much greater than expected at the time of listing. The requirement for drug manufacturers to submit a budget impact analysis as part of the drug approval process suggests that payers are concerned not only with the cost effectiveness of a proposed drug but also with the potential increase in total expenditures that may result from new formulary listings. In this paper we define and analyze a model for financial risk sharing based on the total budget. Our analysis focuses on optimal decision making by manufacturers in the presence of a specific risk sharing agreement. We derive a manufacturer's optimal statement of budget impact and discuss several properties of the optimal solution.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.976,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15685669/,economics
"Empirical studies on pharmaceutical pricing across countries have found evidence that prices vary according to per capita income. These studies are typically based on survey data from a subset of countries and cover only one year. In this paper, we study the international trade and price of insulin by using detailed trade data for 186 importing countries from 1995 to 2013. With almost 12,000 observations, our study constitutes the largest comparative study on pharmaceutical pricing conducted so far. The large dataset allows us to uncover new determinants of price differentials. Our analysis shows that the international trade of insulin increased substantially over this time period, clearly outpacing the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Using the unit values of imports, we also study the determinants of price differentials between countries. Running various panel regressions, we find that the differences in prices across countries can be explained by the following factors: First, corroborating earlier studies, we find that per capita GDP is positively correlated with the unit price of insulin. Second, the price of insulin drugs originating from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries tends to be substantially higher than for those imported from developing countries. Third, more intense competition among suppliers leads to lower insulin prices. Fourth, higher out-of-pocket payments for health care are associated with higher prices. Finally, higher volumes and tariffs seem to result in lower unit prices.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czw085,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27346189/,economics
"This study investigates the capacity of hospitals to vary the intensity of their services based on patients' expected sources of payment. While the concept of price discrimination by hospitals based on payer generosity (""cost-shifting"") has been discussed extensively, the notion that hospitals can adjust payer-specific marginal costs to reflect differences in reimbursement policies has not been studied in depth. To examine this issue. this analysis employs a multiproduct cost function with hospital outputs defined as admissions by payment source, controlling for the distribution and severity of illness (""casemix"") for each payer. Marginal costs of casemix-adjusted discharges are obtained and compared for Medicare, Medicaid, Private Payers, and a residual category that includes uncompensated care.

"Objective:
        
      
      This review aims to put an economic perspective on childhood and adolescent obesity by providing an overview on the latest literature on obesity-related costs and the cost effectiveness of interventions to prevent or manage the problem.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The review is based on a comprehensive PubMed/Medline search performed in October 2011.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Findings on the economic burden of childhood obesity are inconclusive. Considering the different cost components and age groups, most but not all studies found excess health care costs for obese compared with normal-weight peers. The main limitations relate to short study periods and the strong focus on health care costs, neglecting other components of the economic burden of childhood obesity. The results of the economic evaluations of childhood and adolescent obesity programs support the expectation that preventive and management interventions with acceptable cost effectiveness do exist. Some interventions may even be cost saving. However, owing to the differences in various methodologic aspects, it is difficult to compare preventive and treatment approaches in their cost effectiveness or to determine the most cost-effective timing of preventive interventions during infancy and adolescence.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To design effective public policies against the obesity epidemic, a better understanding and a more precise assessment of the health care costs and the broader economic burden are necessary but, critically, depend on the collection of additional longitudinal data. The economic evaluation of childhood obesity interventions poses various methodologic challenges, which should be addressed in future research to fully use the potential of economic evaluation as an aid to decision making.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.11.016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22452837/,economics
"Conventional risk adjustment, which sets capitation payments equal to the average cost of individuals with similar observable characteristics, is not optimal if health plans can use private information to select low-cost enrollees. ""Cost-minimizing risk adjustment"" minimizes the sum of capitated HMO premiums plus FFS costs by balancing the gains from HMO cost efficiency against the overpayments that result from HMO selection.

"Background:
        
      
      Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death in the UK and imposes a huge economic burden on society. Both the prevalence and extent of smoking are significantly higher among people with mental disorders than among the general population.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To estimate the economic costs of the health effects of cigarette smoking among people with mental disorders in the UK from a societal perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study uses the WHO's economics of tobacco toolkit to assess the costs of the health effects of cigarette smoking among people with mental disorders in 2009/10 in the UK. Based on the cost of illness approach, direct healthcare costs, indirect morbidity costs and indirect mortality costs due to smoking-related diseases were calculated to estimate the avoidable economic burden of smoking in people with mental disorders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The estimated economic cost of smoking in people with mental disorders was £2.34 billion in 2009/10 in the UK, of which, about £719 million (31% of the total cost) was spent on treating diseases caused by smoking. Productivity losses due to smoking-related diseases were about £823 million (35%) for work-related absenteeism and £797 million (34%) was associated with premature mortality.
    


          Conclusions:

"Background:
        
      
      Drug-eluting stents represent an additional option to treat coronary artery disease. This technology represents a major breakthrough that may require additional funding in the short-term to enable its inclusion in procedures of the Unified Health System.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To estimate the impact on the Unified Health System budget in the first year of use of drug-eluting stents.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A Budget Impact Model was designed to predict the economic impact of the inclusion of drug-eluting stents in the Unified Health System budget. Data about costs and local procedures were collected in multiple sources, specifically procedure volume data, hospital costs, cost of stents, drug costs and number of stents used in single and multi-vessel procedures.

"This paper analyzes the co-movement and causal linkages between environmental pollution and healthcare expenditure, taking economic growth as a control variable by using wavelet analysis for Taiwan over the period 1995 Q1-2016 Q4. The results show that there exists co-movement and causality between environmental pollution and healthcare expenditure at different frequencies and times. The changes in the relationships of the two variables are observed in certain events such as the period of the expansion stage, the policy of environmental pollution, and the issue of the National Health Insurance Integrated Circuit card (NHI-IC) in Taiwan. In the short-term, positive causality runs from healthcare expenditure to environmental pollution before 2004, while negative causality runs from healthcare expenditure to environmental pollution before 2007 in the long-term. After adding economic growth as a control variable, positive causality runs from healthcare expenditure to environmental pollution in the period 2009-2011 in the short-term, while negative causality running from healthcare expenditure to environmental pollution is shown in 2008 in the long-term. The results indicate that ""higher government health expenditure leading to higher demand for environment quality"" exists in different sub-periods and the argument may concern the factor of economics in the long-term. The positive healthcare lead in the short-term may be based on economics in the expansion stage. Also, the issue of NHI-IC possibly affects the dynamic relationship between healthcare expenditure and environmental pollution without considering economics.

"With the institution of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), the economic survival of tertiary care centers may be threatened. Even more worrisome to these institutions is the possibility of other third-party payors following Medicare's lead and converting to this reimbursement plan. This paper examines the present financial status of the Burn Center at the University of New Mexico Hospital, as well as the future impact if all third-party payments were based on the DRG system. For fiscal years 1985-1987, the Burn Center lost $246,512 over cost for Medicare patients. There was a profit of $724,762 for other third-party payors, and a loss of $692,354 for indigent patients. This resulted in a total loss of $214,101 for the Burn Center during the 3-year study period. With the hypothetical conversion++ of all third-party reimbursement to DRGs, the total 3-year loss would become $1,253,393.

"Economic assessments of health and healthcare have become an integral part of policy decisions in the last decade. Increasingly, this trend is extending to medical decision-making in day-to-day patient-provider interactions. Alzheimer disease (AD) offers a potent example of the clinical and economic issues at stake with its diagnostic techniques, pharmacotherapies, and public health and policy implications. This review introduces basic economic concepts in examining the impact of AD and related care. It presents a summary of the latest economics research on cost estimates of AD and on economic evaluations of diagnostic and management interventions in terms of cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness studies respectively. Empirical and conceptual issues about the interpretation of costs and the uses of evaluative methods are also discussed. We found that the economic costs attributable to AD care is highly variable mostly due to non-standardised methodologies and geographical variations in care patterns. There is, however, little doubt that the impact is substantial and is expected to worsen with the demographic, epidemiologic, technologic and economic transitions worldwide. There are comparatively fewer studies on the cost-effectiveness of interventions in AD. Most of the published work revolves around pharmacotherapeutics while relatively little has been done on diagnostics, patient care programmes and programmes for caregivers. We conclude that there are significant opportunities to strengthen research on standardised cost-of-illness analyses and new cost-effectiveness studies on a broader range of AD interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000066675,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12457077/,economics
"We replicated the study by Tucker-Drob, Cheung, and Briley (2014), who found that the association between science interest and science knowledge depended on economic resources at the family, school, and national levels, using data from the 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). In more economically prosperous families, schools, and nations, student interest was more strongly correlated with actual knowledge. Here, we investigated whether these results still held despite substantial changes to educational and economic systems over roughly a decade. Using similar data from PISA 2015 ( N = 537,170), we found largely consistent results. Students from more economically advantaged homes, schools, and nations exhibited a stronger link between interests and knowledge. However, these moderation effects were substantially reduced, and the main effect of science interest increased by nearly 25%, driven almost entirely by families of low socioeconomic status and nations with low gross domestic product.

"Whatever kind of economic evaluation you plan to undertake, the costs must be assessed. In health care these are first of all divided into costs borne by the NHS (like drugs), by patients and their families (like travel), and by the rest of society (like health education). Next the costs have to be valued in monetary terms; direct costs, like wages, pose little problem, but indirect costs (like time spent in hospital) have to have values imputed to them. And that is not all: costs must be further subdivided into average, marginal, and joint costs, which help decisions on how much of a service should be provided. Capital costs (investments in plant, buildings, and machinery) are also important, as are discounting and inflation.

"Objectives:
        
      
      There are challenges in conducting a budget impact analysis (BIA) for rare disorders. Through this case study, we present some challenges and limitations of a BIA of managing patients affected with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). We explored a conceptual basis and barriers for health services researchers interested in quantifying budget impacts of rare disease management program (DMP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We developed a static budget impact cost calculator model in Microsoft Excel, obtaining the clinical impact of a DMP from the literature and translating it into costs using OLDW. Cost inputs and resource use was obtained from 2010 to 2015 claims data using the OLDW. Insurers' payments were calculated and categorized into the following cost buckets: physician visits, emergency room visits, inpatients stays, augmentation therapy, other prescription drugs costs, and other costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data were based on 6832 patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency identified among over 21 million OLDW enrollees observed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. The introduction of a DMP was estimated to decrease costs of the management of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency by $13.5 million over 5 years. The savings attributed to the program over the 5-year time horizon are due to 2555 exacerbations, 5180 emergency room visits, 9342 specialist visits, and 105 358 general practitioner visits avoided.

Three international databases were interrogated: MEDLINE, Embase, and HealthStar; further articles were added from the internal database of our center (CESAV), which also classifies Italian local publications and journals specialized in health economics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of ninety-nine studies were reviewed. More than half of the fifty-seven full EEs focused on drugs as type of intervention (n = 38), followed by diagnostic screening (n = 7). The NHS viewpoint was the most used (n = 55 studies), followed by that of society (n = 27) and hospitals (n = 12). Sixty-eight studies only analyzed direct costs and twenty-nine included both direct and indirect costs. Twenty-five of the thirty-eight pharmacoeconomic full EEs were sponsored by companies. In sixteen of the twenty-five sponsored studies, the sponsor's products were the dominant alternative.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The review showed that, in Italy, like elsewhere, there is a gap between theory and practice in EEs, and sponsors can considerably affect the results of EEs.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462303000643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15095774/,economics

"An overview of the present state of development of pharmacoeconomics in France is given, and more specifically how it works, in what context it operates, what kind of studies it produces, what kind of results it reaches, and what kind of future it may expect. The main features of the French health care system and French drug economy are described. Six concrete case studies of pharmacoeconomic assessment are then summarised. The economic problem raised by these new well-known drugs, the characteristics and the conclusions of the studies that have been undertaken and the decisions that have been made by health public authorities are presented. Finally presented are some views about the future of what we term the ""institutional pharmacoeconomics"", which is a new discipline used by pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate to institutional buyers the value for money of their new products, and to regulate prices.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0277-9536(96)00402-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9226787/,economics
"In 1988-89, Indiana University became the first public university to implement responsibility-centered management (RCM) comprehensively. This article describes and assesses the implementation of RCM on the core campus of Indiana University School of Nursing in Indianapolis. It describes how RCM encouraged an information-rich environment, particularly with the advent of economic modeling; decision making linked to strategic goals/objectives; and a performance-based reward structure (e.g., merit pay increases and incentive plans). It ends with a discussion about the worth of RCM and the changes that frame-work produced, particularly in reconceptualizing the roles of the business officer and dean. The most profound consequence of RCM may be the effect it has in encouraging rethinking of what it means to be a school of nursing at this point in time.",https://doi.org/10.1053/jpnu.2000.7828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10932994/,economics

A sound epidemiological basis for such calculations appears to be lacking due to inadequate data-registration systems. We also discuss some studies of the economic costs of injuries due to accidents for other countries, which have used either a prevalence or an incidence-based approach. It is highlighted that they may be helpful in indicating the relative economic burden posed on society but that they cannot guide priority setting in health care resource allocation.

"Recent advances in the urban science make broad use of the notion of scaling. We focus here on the important scaling relationship between the gross metropolitan product (GMP) of a city and its population (pop). It has been demonstrated that GMP ∝ Y Ypopβ with β always greater than 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule that holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of cities. However, in an increasingly connected world, the hypothesis that the economy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using data for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010, we found a double GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities, β = 1 over the whole the period, while for post-communist cities β > 1 and increases from ∼1.2 to ∼1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the convergence of post-communist European cities to open and liberal economies. We propose a simple model of economic convergence in which, under stable political conditions, a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results suggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic growth rather than a steady, universal urban feature. The results also suggest that relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic context and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities, urbanization and urban economics.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27551719/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      The UK Health Technology Assessment (HTA) program funds trials that address issues of clinical and cost-effectiveness to meet the needs of the National Health Service (NHS). The objective of this review was to systematically assess the methods of resource use data collection and costing; and to produce a best practice guide for data capture within economic analyses alongside clinical trials.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All 100 HTA-funded primary research papers published to June 2009 were reviewed for the health economic methods employed. Data were extracted and summarized by: health technology assessed, costing perspective adopted, evidence of planning and piloting, data collection method, frequency of data collection, and sources of unit cost data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-five studies were identified as having conducted an economic analysis, of which 85 recorded patient-level resource use. The review identified important differences in how data are collected. These included: a priori evidence of analysts having identified important cost drivers; the piloting and validation of patient-completed resource use questionnaires; choice of costing perspective; and frequency of data collection. Areas of commonality included: the extensive use of routine medical records and reliance on patient recall; and the use of standard sources of unit costs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Economic data collection is variable, even among a homogeneous selection of trials designed to meet the needs of a common organization (NHS). Areas for improvement have been identified, and based on our findings and related reviews and guidelines, a checklist is proposed for good practice relating to economic data collection within clinical trials.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00788.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20946187/,economics
"Using quasi-experimental design methods, this study investigated, for a cost recovery intervention in Niger, how the total costs of an episode of treatment for an acute illness for a typical patient changed when user fees were imposed but accompanied by an improved drug supply. Episode costs included both cash and opportunity costs. With few exceptions, the comparisons of both the unadjusted and adjusted patient episode costs showed that patient total episode costs in the intervention sites increased relative to the control site. The infusion of resources in Say and Boboye meant that now patients had essential medicines to buy, in comparison to Illela where stocks of essential medicines continued to deteriorate. Trends in episode costs within each intervention district demonstrated that to some extent cost recovery accompanied by an improved drug supply did not significantly change the total cost of an episode of treatment. In Say, this was true for malaria cases, females and the poor. However, in Boboye, reductions in copayments were offset by a mandatory tax payment paid by both users and non-users.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1050(199601)5:1<37::aid-hec179>3.0.co;2-m,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653191/,economics

"The pharmaceutical industry is shifting its focus from blockbuster small molecules to specialty pharmaceuticals. Specialty pharmaceuticals are novel drugs and biologic agents that require special handling and ongoing monitoring, are administered by injection or infusion, and are sold in the marketplace by a small number of distributors. They are frequently identified by having a cost to payers and patients of $600 or more per treatment. The total costs of the new agents are likely to have a substantial impact on overall health care costs and on patients during the next decade, unless steps are taken to align competing interests. We examine the economic and policy issues related to specialty pharmaceuticals, taking care to consider the impact on patients. We assess the role of cost-sharing provisions, legislation that is promoting realignment within the market, the role of biosimilars in price competition, and the potential for novel drug development paradigms to help bend the cost curve. The economic aspects of this analysis highlight the need for a far-reaching discussion of potential novel approaches to innovation pathways in our quest for both affordability and new technology.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25288414/,economics

"In this paper, we examine the role of insurance coverage in explaining the generic competition paradox in a two-stage game involving a single producer of brand-name drugs and n quantity-competing producers of generic drugs. Independently of brand loyalty, which some studies rely upon to explain the paradox, we show that heterogeneity in insurance coverage may result in higher prices of brand-name drugs following generic entry. With market segmentation based on insurance coverage present in both the pre- and post-entry stages, the paradox can arise when the two types of drugs are highly substitutable and the market is quite profitable but does not have to arise when the two types of drugs are highly differentiated. However, with market segmentation occurring only after generic entry, the paradox can arise when the two types of drugs are weakly substitutable, provided, however, that the industry is not very profitable. In both cases, that is, when market segmentation is present in the pre-entry stage and when it is not, the paradox becomes more likely to arise as the market expands and/or insurance companies decrease deductibles applied on the purchase of generic drugs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.02.004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22484368/,economics
"Restricted public budgets and increasing efforts to link the impact of community interventions to public savings have increased the use of economic evaluation. While this type of evaluation can be important for program planning, it also raises important ethical issues about how we value the time of local stakeholders who support community interventions. In particular, researchers navigate issues of scientific accuracy, institutional inequality, and research utility in their pursuit of even basic cost estimates. We provide an example of how we confronted these issues when estimating the costs of a large-scale community-based intervention.

"Infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) results in major economic losses either directly through decreased productive performance in cattle herds or indirectly, such as through expenses for control programs. The aim of this systematic review was to review financial and/or economic assessment studies of prevention and/or mitigation activities of BVDV at national, regional and farm level worldwide. Once all predefined criteria had been met, 35 articles were included for this systematic review. Studies were analyzed with particular focus on the type of financially and/or economically-assessed prevention and/or mitigation activities. Due to the wide range of possible prevention and/or mitigation activities, these activities were grouped into five categories: i) control and/or eradication programs, ii) monitoring or surveillance, iii) prevention, iv) vaccination and v) individual culling, control and testing strategies. Additionally, the studies were analyzed according to economically-related variables such as efficiency, costs or benefits of prevention and/or mitigation activities, the applied financial and/or economic and statistical methods, the payers of prevention and/or mitigation activities, the assessed production systems, and the countries for which such evaluations are available. Financial and/or economic assessments performed in Europe were dominated by those from the United Kingdom, which assessed mostly vaccination strategies, and Norway which primarily carried out assessments in the area of control and eradication programs; whereas among non-European countries the United States carried out the majority of financial and/or economic assessments in the area of individual culling, control and testing. More than half of all studies provided an efficiency calculation of prevention and/or mitigation activities and demonstrated whether the inherent costs of implemented activities were or were not justified. The dairy sector was three times more likely to be assessed by the countries than beef production systems. In addition, the dairy sector was approximately eight times more likely to be assessed economically with respect to prevention and/or mitigation activities than calf and youngstock production systems. Furthermore, the private sector was identified as the primary payer of prevention and/or mitigation activities. This systematic review demonstrated a lack of studies relating to efficiency calculations, in particular at national and regional level, and the specific production systems. Thus, we confirmed the need for more well-designed studies in animal health economics in order to demonstrate that the implementation and inherent costs of BVDV prevention and/or mitigation activities are justified.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.12.014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28040270/,economics
"We examine the effect of a value-based insurance design (VBID) program implemented at a large public employer in the state of Oregon. The program substantially increased cost-sharing for several healthcare services likely to be of low value for most patients: diagnostic services (e.g., imaging services) and surgeries (e.g., spinal surgeries for pain). Using a difference-in-differences design coupled with granular, administrative health insurance claims data over the period 2008-2012, we estimate the change in low-value service use among beneficiaries before and after program implementation relative to a comparison group not exposed to the VBID. Our findings suggest that the VBID significantly reduced the use of targeted services, with an implied elasticity of demand of -0.22. We find no evidence that the VBID led to substitution to non-targeted services or increased overall healthcare costs. However, we also observe no evidence that the program led to cost-savings.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4127,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32686138/,economics
"Biomedicine has made enormous progress in the last half century in treating common diseases. However, we are becoming victims of our own success. Causes of death strongly associated with biological aging, such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke-cluster within individuals as they grow older. These conditions increase frailty and limit the benefits of continued, disease-specific improvements. Here, we show that a ""delayed-aging"" scenario, modeled on the biological benefits observed in the most promising animal models, could solve this problem of competing risks. The economic value of delayed aging is estimated to be $7.1 trillion over 50 years. Total government costs, including Social Security, rise substantially with delayed aging--mainly caused by longevity increases--but we show that these can be offset by modest policy changes. Expanded biomedical research to delay aging appears to be a highly efficient way to forestall disease and extend healthy life.",https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a025072,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26684333/,economics
"The laws of microeconomics explain how prices affect consumer purchasing decisions and thus overall revenues and profits. These principles can easily be applied to the behavior aesthetic plastic surgery patients. The UCLA Division of Plastic Surgery resident aesthetics clinic recently offered a radical price change for its services. The effects of this change on demand for services and revenue were tracked. Economic analysis was applied to see if this price change resulted in the maximization of total revenues, or if additional price changes could further optimize them. Economic analysis of pricing involves several steps. The first step is to assess demand. The number of procedures performed by a given practice at different price levels can be plotted to create a demand curve. From this curve, price sensitivities of consumers can be calculated (price elasticity of demand). This information can then be used to determine the pricing level that creates demand for the exact number of procedures that yield optimal revenues. In economic parlance, revenues are maximized by pricing services such that elasticity is equal to 1 (the point of unit elasticity). At the UCLA resident clinic, average total fees per procedure were reduced by 40 percent. This resulted in a 250-percent increase in procedures performed for representative 4-month periods before and after the price change. Net revenues increased by 52 percent. Economic analysis showed that the price elasticity of demand before the price change was 6.2. After the price change it was 1. We conclude that the magnitude of the price change resulted in a fee schedule that yielded the highest possible revenues from the resident clinic. These results show that changes in price do affect total revenue and that the nature of these effects can be understood, predicted, and maximized using the tools of microeconomics.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00006534-199902000-00054,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9950562/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      Achieving universal health insurance coverage is a goal for many developing countries. Even when universal health insurance programmes are in place, there are significant barriers to reaching the lowest socio-economic groups such as a lack of awareness of the programmes or knowledge of the benefits to participating in the insurance market. Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes can encourage participation through mandatory health education classes, increased contact with the health care system and cash payments to reduce costs of participating in the insurance market.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To explore if participation in a CCT programme in Mexico, Oportunidades, is significantly associated with self-reported enrolment in a public health insurance programme.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Cross-sectional data from 2007 collected on 29 595 Mexican households where the household head is aged between ages 15 and 60 were analysed. A logit model was used to estimate the association between Oportunidades participation and awareness of enrolment in a public health insurance programme.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participation in the Oportunidades programme is associated with a 25% higher likelihood of being actively aware of enrolment in Seguro Popular, a public health insurance scheme for the lowest socio-economic groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Participation in the Oportunidades CCT programme is positively associated with awareness of enrolment in public health insurance. CCT programmes may be used to promote participation of the lowest socio-economic groups in universal public health insurance systems.

"This paper analyzes some of the perverse incentives that may arise under the current Medicare prescription drug benefit design. In particular, risk adjustment for a stand-alone prescription drug benefit creates perverse incentives for prescription drug plans when making coverage decisions and/or for pharmaceutical companies when setting prices. This problem is new in that it does not arise with risk adjustment for other types of health care coverage. For this and other reasons, Medicare's drug benefit requires especially close regulatory oversight, now and in the future. We also consider a relatively minor change in financing the benefit that could lead to significant changes in how the benefit functions. In particular, if all plans were required to charge the same premium, there would be less diversity in quality, but also less need to regulate formulary composition, less budgetary uncertainty, and less upward pressure on drug prices.",https://doi.org/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_44.2.157,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17850042/,economics

Erroneously high estimates of costs, designed to jolt decision makers into action, may do more harm than good in the struggle to attract funding for infection control.

For this article, we critically review the field and discuss 3 questions. Why measure the cost of an HAI? What outcome should be used to measure the cost of an HAI? What is the best method for making this measurement?

"Background:
        
      
       Costly prescription medicines with existing cheaper alternatives tend to be purchased by medically insured consumers of healthcare. In South Africa medical scheme members pay higher out-of-pocket payments for medicines than those without insurance.
    


          Aim:
        
      
       This study explored reasons for co-payments among insured Pretoria medical scheme members purchasing prescription medicines at private retail pharmacies, despite being insured and protected against such payments.
    


          Setting:
        
      
       The study took place in retail pharmacies in Pretoria, Gauteng Province, South Africa.
    


          Methods:
        
      
       An exploratory qualitative study was performed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among purposefully sampled medical scheme members (12) and nine key informants (six pharmacists and three regulators - one for the pharmaceutical industry, one for medical schemes and one for pharmacists). Three pharmacies (two corporate and one independent) each were identified from high and low socio-economic areas. Scheme members were interviewed immediately after having made a co-payment (eight) or no co-payment (four) from the selected pharmacies. Interviews were recorded, coded and organised into themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
       Co-payments were deemed confusing, unpredictable and inconsistent between and within pharmacies. Members blamed schemes for causing co-payments. Six sampled pharmacies rarely stocked the lowest-priced medicines; instead, they dispensed medicines from manufacturers with whom they had a relationship. Corporate pharmacies were favoured compared to independents and brand loyalty superseded cost considerations. Medical scheme members did not understand how medical schemes' function.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
       Unavailability of lowest-priced medicines at pharmacies contributes to co-payments.

"Background:
        
      
      Expenditure on hemodialysis therapy is high within the Japanese health care system, and cost reductions are desirable to maintain the system. Under these circumstances, both a macroeconomic analysis and a microeconomic analysis of the country's health care system are needed to elucidate its problems.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      A macroeconomic analysis showed that Japan's sluggish GDP growth since the 1990s has been a major problem in the allocation of health care resources, and government policies have been put in place to reduce health care expenditure. In contrast, a microeconomic analysis showed that the Japanese health care system is being run very efficiently. For hemodialysis therapy specifically, the mortality rate is low and medical costs are not high, indicating that treatment is being provided in a highly efficient manner. Key Messages: These results suggest the direction that Japan's health care system, including hemodialysis therapy, should take will increase health care expenditure commensurate with the nation's economic growth.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000450819,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27951577/,economics

"We study whether employer premium contribution schemes could impact the pricing behavior of health plans and contribute to rising premiums. Using 1991-2011 data before and after a 1999 premium subsidy policy change in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), we find that the employer premium contribution scheme has a differential impact on health plan pricing based on two market incentives: 1) consumers are less price sensitive when they only need to pay part of the premium increase, and 2) each health plan has an incentive to increase the employer's premium contribution to that plan. Both incentives are found to contribute to premium growth. Counterfactual simulation shows that average premium would have been 10% less than observed and the federal government would have saved 15% per year on its premium contribution had the subsidy policy change not occurred in the FEHBP. We discuss the potential of similar incentives in other government-subsidized insurance systems such as the Medicare Part D and the Health Insurance Marketplace under the Affordable Care Act.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2014.08.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25241905/,economics
"Purpose:
        
      
      Targeted cancer therapies (TCTs) are drugs that specifically act on molecular targets within the cancer cell, causing its regression and/or destruction. Although TCTs offer clinically important gains in survival in one of the most challenging therapeutic areas, these gains are followed by considerable increases in health care expenditures. The aim of this study was to identify differences in the recommendations for TCTs in 3 European health care systems (Serbian, Scottish, and Dutch) and to examine the role of pharmacoeconomic (PE) assessments in such recommendations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A list of currently approved TCTs cited from the European Medicines Agency was cross-referenced with drug reimbursement reports issued by the National Health Insurance Fund for Serbia, the Scottish Medicines Consortium for Scotland, and the National Health Institute for the Netherlands. The following key variables were gathered from the reports: drug indication, registration status, reimbursement status, and outcome of the PE evaluation.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      There were 41 TCTs approved by the European Medicines Agency for 70 cancer indications. Of the total number of TCT indications, 20 were reimbursed in Serbia, and 25 are still without a decision from the national agency. The remaining TCT indications (n = 25) are not registered in Serbia. None of the submissions or the PE analyses were publicly available. The Scottish Medicines Consortium positively assessed 26 TCT indications and rejected 30. All appraisals were published, and the majority contained full PE assessments. Finally, the Dutch agency accepted 60 TCT indications and disapproved the use of 1. The majority of reimbursed drugs were exempted from PE evaluation in accordance with 2 recent policies regarding expensive hospital drugs.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      In the 3 examined health care systems, the reimbursement status of the TCTs differed significantly. Level of PE application within the TCT evaluation procedures seemed to largely affect the final reimbursement decisions. Although, there are special policies in the Netherlands that enabled fast access for 98% of the TCTs that applied for reimbursement, a clear definition of cost-effectiveness threshold and strict requirements for full cost utility assessments in Scotland led to acceptance of only 46% of the TCT submissions. More precise PE guidelines must still be designed for TCT reimbursement in Serbia. Guidelines must account for specific epidemic and economic conditions of the country and could build on the experiences of Scotland and the Netherlands.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2014.12.005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25638534/,economics
"Employment-based health insurance is failing. Costs are out of control. Employers have no effective strategy to deal with this. They must think strategically about fundamental change. This analysis explains how employers' purchasing policies contribute to rising costs and block growth of economical care. Single-source managed care is ineffective, and effective managed care cannot be a single source. Employers should create exchanges through which they can offer employees wide, responsible, individual, multiple choices among health care delivery systems and create serious competition based on value for money. Recently introduced technology can assist this process.",https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.w3.237,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14527258/,economics

"A number of health economics studies require patient cost estimates as basic information input. However, the accuracy of cost estimates remains generally unspecified. We propose to investigate how the allocation of indirect costs or overheads can affect the estimation of patient costs and lead to improvements in the analysis of patient cost estimates. Instead of focussing on the costing method, this paper will highlight observed changes in variation explained by a methodology choice. We compare four overhead allocation methods for a specific Spanish population adjusted using the Clinical Risk Groups model. Our main conclusion is that the amount of global variation explained by the risk adjustment model depends mainly on direct costs, regardless of the cost allocation methodology used. Furthermore, the variation explained can be slightly increased, depending on the cost allocation methodology, and is independent of the level of aggregation in the classification system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-010-0227-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20306112/,economics
"The world is still recovering from the financial crisis peaking in September 2008. The triggering event was the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. To detect such turmoils, one can investigate the time-dependent behaviour of correlations between assets or indices. These cross-correlations have been connected to the systemic risks within markets by several studies in the aftermath of this crisis. We study 37 different US indices which cover almost all aspects of the US economy and show that monitoring an average investor's behaviour can be used to quantify times of increased risk. In this paper the overall investing strategy is approximated by the ground-states of the mean-variance model along the efficient frontier bound to real world constraints.

"Due to the challenge of operating within an economically strained healthcare budget, Portuguese health authorities convened with dialysis providers and agreed on a framework to change from a fee-for-service reimbursement modality to a capitation payment system for hemodialysis. This article reviews the components of the agreed capitation package implemented in 2008 as well as the necessary preparatory work undertaken by a for-profit 34-unit dialysis network (approx. 4,200 patients) to cope with the introduction of this system. Furthermore, trends in clinical quality indicators and in resource management are reviewed for 3 years immediately following capitation introduction. Here, improvements were observed over time for the specified clinical targets. Simultaneously, costs controllable by the physician could be reduced. As more countries convert to a capitation or bundled payment system for hemodialysis services, this article offers insight into the scope of the necessary preparatory work and the possible consequences in terms of costs and treatment quality.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000343128,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23306519/,economics

This is used to measure prescription drug cost-drivers for the population of seniors in British Columbia during a period when they received comprehensive public drug coverage. Between 1991 and 2001, expenditures on prescription drugs for BC seniors increased from dollar 149 to 320 million. Increases in the population of seniors, and the rate at which they utilized therapies contributed under half of the total cost increase over the period. Changes in the mix of therapies and the type of product selected explained over half of the observed drug expenditure inflation.

"Environmental degradation is causing global warming, which is of the utmost concern to both physical and social scientists. A number of potential determinants of environmental degradation are analysed in the literature. This study examines the role of government expenditure and financial development in environmental degradation in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for the Venezuelan economy. Time series data have been analysed for this purpose. The long-term relationship between the variables in this study is established through a bounds test in the presence of an unknown structural break. The results of this study confirm the EKC hypothesis. It is found that energy use is harming the quality of the environment not only in the long run but also in the short run. This study finds a positive impact of government expenditure on environmental degradation, which indicates that the Venezuelan government is not taking its expenditure for a sustainable environment into account. Moreover, this study finds that financial development is hindering environmental degradation. This means that financial institutions in Venezuela can help to develop the concept of sustainable energy in the country and the Venezuelan government can reduce carbon emissions through financial development.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30629649/,economics

"Objective:
        
      
      We sought to examine scholarly outcomes of the projects receiving research grants from the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) during the first 10 years of national funding (i.e., between 1996 and 2005).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We sent email surveys to 62 emergency medicine (EM) researchers who received funding from CAEP. We focused our data collection on grant deliverables and opinions using a 1-7 Likert scale with regard to the value of the award.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-eight recipients responded to our survey. Grants were most commonly awarded to residents (21 [36%]), followed by senior (16 [28%]) and junior (13 [22%]) emergency staff. Twenty-six applicants from Ontario and 11 from Quebec received the majority of the grants. Overall, 51 projects were completed at the time of contact and, from these, 39 manuscripts were published or in press. Abstract presentations were more common, with a median of 2 abstracts presented per completed project. Abstract presentations for the completed projects were documented locally (23), nationally (39) and internationally (37). Overall, 19 projects received additional funding. The median amount funded was Can$4700 with an interquartile range of $3250-$5000. Respondents felt CAEP funding was critical to completing their projects and felt strongly that dedicated EM research funding should be continued to stimulate productivity.

"The health sector is facing many challenges, and there is a need to maintain the delivery of high-quality health-care. Issues related to equity and access to health-care have emerged in a context of an economic recession in which the sustainability of the health system depends on everyone, including the actions and decisions of professionals. Therefore, nurses and their skills may be the answer to ethical, professional and community health management, but this recession could lead to major problems in the education of nurses in daily health-care practice. Due to the limited availability of resources, nurses are increasingly taking leadership positions, continuing to develop their critical abilities and thinking skills, and considering sciences such as deontology and ethics. The main goals of this study were to reflect on the economic recession and its impact on health-care and to demonstrate the contribution of nursing to the sustainability of health-care and in the promotion of individuals' dignity. The authors conclude that health-care depends on economic redistribution and, in this context, needs to be equitable and fair.

"Most economists have suggested that the growing presence of insurance, including Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and the commercial insurers, is largely responsible for the rapid rise of health care costs in the United States. It is the contention of this paper, however, that the insurance industry in the private sector in the United States may help in the effort to contain costs rather than solely stimulating rapidly increasing costs. A number of methods that insurers have employed to contain costs, including monitoring provider behavior and prospective reimbursement, are identified. It is cautioned, however, that although health insurer cost containment efforts will continue to expand in the future, perversities in the U.S. tax laws, potential provider opposition and the complexities of medicine will continue to make cost containment a difficult task.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(82)90233-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7201677/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      This paper aims to assess the methodological quality of economic evaluations included in Belgian reimbursement applications for Class 1 drugs.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      For 19 reimbursement applications submitted during 2011 and Spring 2012, a descriptive analysis assessed the methodological quality of the economic evaluation, evaluated the assessment of that economic evaluation by the Drug Reimbursement Committee and the response to that assessment by the company. Compliance with methodological guidelines issued by the Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre was assessed using a detailed checklist of 23 methodological items. The rate of compliance was calculated based on the number of economic evaluations for which the item was applicable.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Economic evaluations tended to comply with guidelines regarding perspective, target population, subgroup analyses, comparator, use of comparative clinical data and final outcome measures, calculation of costs, incremental analysis, discounting and time horizon. However, more attention needs to be paid to the description of limitations of indirect comparisons, the choice of an appropriate analytic technique, the expression of unit costs in values for the current year, the estimation and valuation of outcomes, the presentation of results of sensitivity analyses, and testing the face validity of model inputs and outputs. Also, a large variation was observed in the scope and depth of the quality assessment by the Drug Reimbursement Committee.

"The objective was to review recent economic evaluations of influenza vaccination by injection in the US, assess their evidence, and conclude on their collective findings. The literature was searched for economic evaluations of influenza vaccination injection in healthy working adults in the US published since 1995. Ten evaluations described in nine papers were identified. These were synopsized and their results evaluated, the basic structure of all evaluations was ascertained, and sensitivity of outcomes to changes in parameter values were explored using a decision model. Areas to improve economic evaluations were noted. Eight of nine evaluations with credible economic outcomes were favourable to vaccination, representing a statistically significant result compared with a proportion of 50% that would be expected if vaccination and no vaccination were economically equivalent. Evaluations shared a basic structure, but differed considerably with respect to cost components, assumptions, methods, and parameter estimates. Sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in parameter values within the feasible range, individually or simultaneously, could reverse economic outcomes. Given stated misgivings, the methods of estimating influenza reduction ascribed to vaccination must be researched to confirm that they produce accurate and reliable estimates. Research is also needed to improve estimates of the costs per case of influenza illness and the costs of vaccination. Based on their assumptions, the reviewed papers collectively appear to support the economic benefits of influenza vaccination of healthy adults. Yet the underlying assumptions, methods and parameter estimates themselves warrant further research to confirm they are accurate, reliable and appropriate to economic evaluation purposes.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11596890-000000000-00000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22462695/,economics
"Introduction:
        
      
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a heritable chronic condition. Due to the genetic and progressive nature of CF, a number of interventions are available for the condition. In the United Kingdom (U.K.) average annual cost of CF treatment is between €49,000 to €76,000 (2012) per patient [1]. A review of health economic modelling studies is warranted to provide decision makers and researchers with an in depth understanding of modelling practices in CF and guidance for future research.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Online searches were performed in the 5 databases, studies were included if they were: a) Model based economic evaluation for management of Cystic Fibrosis. Articles were restricted to English language only, but no restriction was applied on publication year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine studies were reviewed, most were Markov cohort models. Models evaluated pharmaceutical interventions and drug adherence. Modelling structure was consistent across most articles and a range of sources were used to populate the models. Cost and utility data were based on different sources and elicitation methods respectively. The majority of models failed to incorporate significant health events which impact both cost and disease progression.

"Background:
        
      
      Health technology assessments (HTAs) that take account of future price changes have been examined in the literature, but the important issue of price reductions that are generated by the reimbursement decision has been ignored.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To explore the impact of future price reductions caused by increasing uptake on HTAs and decision making for medical devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We demonstrate the use of a two-stage modeling approach to derive estimates of technology price as a consequence of changes in technology uptake over future periods on the basis of existing theory and supported by empirical studies. We explore the impact on cost-effectiveness and expected value of information analysis in an illustrative example on the basis of a technology in development for preterm birth screening.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The application of our approach to the case study technology generates smaller incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with the commonly used single cohort approach. The extent of this reduction in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio depends on the magnitude of the modeled price reduction, the speed of diffusion, and the length of the assumed technology life horizon. Results of value of information analysis are affected through changes in the expected net benefit calculation, the addition of uncertain parameters, and the diffusion-adjusted estimate of the affected patient population.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Because modeling future changes in price and uptake has the potential to affect HTA outcomes, modeling techniques that can address such changes should be considered for medical devices that may otherwise be rejected.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.06.002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27712696/,economics

"Background and aims:
        
      
      Increasing the reach of smoking cessation services and/or including new but effective medications to the current provision may provide significant health and economic benefits; the scale of such benefits is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness from a health-care perspective of viable national level changes in smoking cessation provision in the Netherlands and England.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A Markov-based state transition model [European study on Quantifying Utility of Investment in Protection from Tobacco model (EQUIPTMOD)] was used to estimate costs and benefits [expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] of changing the current provision of smoking cessation programmes in the Netherlands and England. The changes included: (a) increasing the reach of top-level services to increase potential quitters (e.g. brief physician advice); (b) increasing the reach of behavioural support (group-based therapy and SMS text-messaging support) to increase the success rates; (c) including a new but effective medication (cytisine); and (d) all changes implemented together (combined change). The costs and QALYs generated by those changes over 2, 5, 10 years and a life-time were compared with that of the current practice in each country. Results were expressed as incremental net benefit (INB) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A sequential analysis from a life-time perspective was conducted to identify the optimal change.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The combined change was dominant (cost-saving) over all alternative changes and over the current practice, in both countries. The combined change would generate an incremental net benefit of €11.47 (2 years) to €56.16 (life-time) per smoker in the Netherlands and €9.96 (2 years) to €60.72 (life-time) per smoker in England. The current practice was dominated by all alternative changes.
    


          Conclusion:

"Background:
        
      
      Marketing of new and existing drugs with new indications used alone or in combination is increasing.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To identify the advantages and disadvantages of indication-based pricing (IBP) systems for such drugs from the standpoint of economic theory, practical applications and international experiences.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic review of published articles and reports using six bibliographic databases: PubMed, ASCO, Scopus, DARE, HTA and NHS EED. We also conducted a search of gray literature in Google Scholar. The same search terms were used as in Towse et al. (The debate on indication-based pricing in the U.S. and five major European countries. OHE Consulting Report, London, 2018). Articles and reports published from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2018 were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. There are three main types of IBP: different brands with different prices for each indication, an averaged single price for all indications and a single price with differential discounts. The studies indicate that IBP systems are premised on the idea that charging a different price for different indications reflects the differences in their value and in social willingness to pay for each one and for the investment in R&D based on the indication's incremental clinical benefit. Some argue that a uniform price reduces access and increases the price for lower-value indications, while others contend that if IBP sets prices at the maximum threshold of social willingness to pay for each indication, all surplus is transferred to the producer and consumer surplus is reduced to zero. No practical applications of pure IBP were found. Single pricing for drugs is the most prevalent approach. The system that most closely approximates an IBP model consists of agreements that are generally confidential and linked to risk-sharing agreements.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There are no applications of pure IBP systems and their practical consequences are therefore unknown.

"There is increasing interest in the prospects for managed market reforms in developing countries, stimulated by current reforms and policy debates in developed countries, and by perceptions of widespread public sector inefficiency in many countries. This review examines the prospects for such reforms in a developing country context, primarily by drawing on the arguments and evidence emerging from developed countries, with a specific focus on the provision of hospital services. The paper begins with a discussion of the current policy context of these reforms, and their main features. It argues that while current and proposed reforms vary in detail, most have in common the introduction of competition in the provision of health care, with the retention of a public monopoly of financing, and that this structure emerges from the dual goals of addressing current public sector inefficiencies while retaining the known equity and efficiency advantages of public health systems. The paper then explores the theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for and against these reforms, and examines their relevance for developing countries. Managed markets are argued to enhance both efficiency and equity. These arguments are analysed in terms of three distinct claims made by their proponents: that managed markets will promote increased provider competition, and hence, provider efficiency; that contractual relationships are more efficient than direct management; and that the benefits of managed markets will outweigh their costs. The analysis suggests that on all three issues, the theoretical arguments and empirical evidence remain ambiguous, and that this ambiguity is attributable in part to poor understanding of the behaviour of health sector agents within the market, and to the limited experience with these reforms. In the context of developing countries, the paper argues that most of the conditions required for successful implementation of these reforms are absent in all but a few, richer developing countries, and that the costs of these reforms, particularly in equity terms, are likely to pose substantial problems. Extensive managed market reforms are therefore unlikely to succeed, although limited introduction of particular elements of these reforms may be more successful. Developed country experience is useful in defining the conditions under which such limited reforms may succeed. There is an urgent need to evaluate the existing experience of different forms of contracting in developing countries, as well as to interpret emerging evidence from developed country reforms in the light of conditions in developing countries.",https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/9.3.237,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10137740/,economics
"Background:
        
      
      This report was conceived as a contribution to the national debate regarding U.S. health care (HC) and as a means of explaining the challenges facing U.S. HC to the international readers of WORLD NEUROSURGERY.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The basic economic concepts pertinent to health care, including fundamentals of economic theories, gross domestic product (GDP), U.S. revenues and expenditures and the U.S. federal deficit and national debt, are discussed at the outset of this study. This is followed by a review of the U.S. health insurance paradigms and a detailed analysis of the escalating cost of U.S. health care. Finally, the efforts designed to reverse the paradigm of escalating health care costs will be discussed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study reveals that should the U.S. HC cost continue to escalate at the same rate, HC would consume the entire gross domestic product by 2070. The root causes for this trend are overutilization of HC, inappropriate allocation of HC costs at the end of life, defensive medicine, high-end technology and prescription drugs, failure of competitive market forces, and administrative costs, inefficiency, and waste. The proposed means of reversing this paradigm, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are discussed in light of their economic and social impact.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The reversal of the current paradigm of escalating cost of U.S. HC will require extraordinary leadership across the entire spectrum of HC delivery. It is concluded that neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Path to Prosperity will succeed unless the escalating cost of U.S. HC is reversed.

"Health economic evaluations potentially provide valuable information to clinicians, health care administrators, and policy makers regarding the financial implications of decisions about the care of patients. The highest quality research should be used to inform decisions that have direct impact on the access to care and the outcome of treatment. However, economic analyses are often complex and use research methods which are relatively unfamiliar to clinicians. Furthermore, health economic data have substantial national, regional, and institutional variability, which can limit the external validity of the results of a study. Therefore, minimum guidelines that aim to standardise the quality and transparency of reporting health economic research have been developed, and instruments are available to assist in the assessment of its quality and the interpretation of results.

"An understanding of the relationship between cost sharing and drug consumption depends on consistent and unbiased price elasticity estimates. However, there is wide heterogeneity among studies, which constrains the applicability of elasticity estimates for empirical purposes and policy simulation. This paper attempts to provide a corrected measure of the drug price elasticity by employing meta-regression analysis (MRA). The results indicate that the elasticity estimates are significantly different from zero, and the corrected elasticity is -0.209 when the results are made robust to heteroskedasticity and clustering of observations. Elasticity values are higher when the study was published in an economic journal, when the study employed a greater number of observations, and when the study used aggregate data. Elasticity estimates are lower when the institutional setting was a tax-based health insurance system.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1190,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17238227/,economics
"The measurement of the burden of disease and the interventions that address that burden can be done in various units. Reducing these measures to the common denominator of economic units (i.e., currency) enables comparison with other health entities, interventions, and even other fields. Economic assessment is complex, however, because of the multifactorial components of what constitutes health and what constitutes health interventions, as well as the coupling of those data to economic means. To perform economic modeling in a meaningful manner, it is necessary to: (1) define the health problem to be addressed; (2) define the intervention to be assessed; (3) define a measure of the effect of the health entity with and without the intervention (which includes defining the counterfactual); and (4) determine the appropriate method of converting the health effect to economics. This paper discusses technical aspects of how economic modeling can be done both of disease entities and of interventions. Two examples of economic modeling applied to surgical problems are then given.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1796-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23052800/,economics
"In this paper, the authors detail the structure and optimal management of health systems as influenced by the presence and level of fixed costs. Unlike variable costs, fixed costs cannot be altered, and are thus independent of the level of veterinary activity in the short run. Their importance is illustrated by using both single-period and multi-period models. It is shown that multi-stage veterinary decision-making can often be envisaged as a sequence of fixed-cost problems. In general, it becomes clear that, the higher the fixed costs, the greater the net benefit of veterinary activity must be, if such activity is to be economic. The authors also assess the extent to which it pays to reduce fixed costs and to try to compensate for this by increasing variable costs. Fixed costs have major implications for the industrial structure of the animal health products industry and for the structure of the private veterinary services industry. In the former, they favour market concentration and specialisation in the supply of products. In the latter, they foster increased specialisation. While cooperation by individual farmers may help to reduce their individual fixed costs, the organisational difficulties and costs involved in achieving this cooperation can be formidable. In such cases, the only solution is government provision of veterinary services. Moreover, international cooperation may be called for. Fixed costs also influence the nature of the provision of veterinary education.",https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.36.1.2608,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28926029/,economics
"Objectives:
        
      
      The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is an independent organization that reviews drugs and devices with a focus on emerging agents. As part of their evaluation, ICER estimates value-based prices (VBP) at $50 000 to $150 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained thresholds. We compared actual estimated net prices to ICER-estimated VBPs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed ICER final evidence reports from November 2007 to October 2020. List prices were combined with average discounts obtained from SSR Health to estimate net prices. If a drug had been evaluated more than once for the same indication, only the more recent VBP was included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 34 ICER reports provided unique VBPs for 102 drugs. The net price of 81% of drugs exceeded the $100 000 per QALY VBP and 71% exceeded the $150 000 per QALY VBP. The median change in net price needed to reach the $150 000 per QALY VBP was a 36% reduction. The median decrease in net price needed was highest for drugs targeting rare inherited disorders (n = 15; 62%) and lowest for cardiometabolic disorders (n = 6; 162% price increase). The reduction in net prices needed to reach ICER-estimated VBPs was higher for drugs evaluated for the first approved indication, rare diseases, less competitive markets, and if the drug approval occurred before the ICER report became available.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Net prices are often above VBPs estimated by ICER. Although gaining awareness among decision makers, the long-term impact of ICER evaluations on pricing and access to new drugs continues to evolve.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.01.006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34119076/,economics

"Purpose:
        
      
      As costs of cancer care rise, there has been a shift to focus on value. Drug wastage affects costs to patients and health care systems without adding value. Historically, cost-effectiveness analyses have used models that assume no drug wastage; however, this may not reflect real-world practices. We sought to identify the frequency of drug wastage modeling in economic evaluations of modern parenteral therapies for hematologic malignancies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of new US Food and Drug Administration-approved parenteral chemotherapies with indications for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The primary outcome of interest was the proportion of studies that modeled drug wastage in base-case analyses. If wastage was considered in primary analyses, we reported the impact of wastage on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and drug acquisition costs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Wastage was considered in base-case analyses in less than one third of all publications reviewed (12 of 38; 32%). Of these, two studies went on to complete sensitivity analyses and reported significant changes in the calculated ICER as a result. In one study, the ICER increased by 32%, and in the second, accounting for wastage changed a positive ICER to a dominant result.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Potential costs associated with drug wastage are considered in only one third of modern cost-effectiveness models. The impact of wastage on calculated ICERs and drug acquisition costs is potentially substantial. The modeling of wastage in base-case and sensitivity analyses is recommended for future economic evaluations of new intravenous therapies for hematologic malignancies.",https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.2015.005876,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26330534/,economics
"Background: The expansion of trust law to the German statutory health insurance (SHI) and the declining numbers of sickness funds suggest a strong concentration process in the German SHI market. The paper examines the level and development of market concentration since the introduction of the free choice of sickness funds in 1996. Data: The study is based on a dataset containing information on membership, contribution rate, openness, area of activity and legal successor for all sickness funds in the period from 1996 to 2013. Methods: Market concentration is measured by the concentration rate (cumulative market share of the largest market participants) and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI). In addition, the change in the HHI is also disaggregated into 3 factors: opening, switching and fusion of sickness funds. Results: Concentration rate and HHI decreased significantly between 1996 and 2008 due to opening of former closed sickness funds and a switching behaviour from large to small funds. The SHI Competition Enhancement Act of 2007 led to a turnaround. The reform permitted cross-type mergers and introduced a completely new system of budget allocation with the central health fund. The latter put an end to the growing membership of small funds due to adverse selection processes. As a result, market concentration in the German SHI rises. Although recent mega-mergers were uncritical for nationwide competition, the study already indicates the risk of market dominance on the regional level.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1396891,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25760099/,economics

"Despite a burgeoning interest in and acceptance of corporate health promotion, the overall economic effects of these programs are not clear. Although ultimate resolution of this question awaits detailed empiric research, a theoretical approach can be useful in structuring the problem and understanding the critical issues. The financial model presented views the firm as a value-maximizing enterprise and evaluates health promotion as a use of corporate assets. The model projects the benefits and costs to the firm of a 7-year health promotion program under a variety of assumptions regarding the employee mix and the effects of the health promotion program on health and productivity. The analysis reveals that the base case assumptions result in a program that creates value for the firm when the cost is less than $193 per participating employee per year. Firms with a highly productive, difficult to replace, and older employee group are most likely to find health promotion to be a good investment. Productivity gains produce the majority of the economic benefits of the program. Effects on health care expense alone are projected to be relatively small. Gains from reduction in employee mortality or retiree health expense are found to be insignificant in this model.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00043764-199108000-00011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1941281/,economics
"Although much has been written about implementing mission-based management tools to help facilitate managing the primary academic missions at academic medical centers, there is surprisingly little written on standardized methodologies to align financial support across the academic and clinical missions. However, professional fee reimbursement has not kept pace with costs, and this, combined with potential decreases in research funding associated with the reductions in National Institutes of Health funding, creates additional financial challenges for academic clinical departments that do not share in technical fee reimbursement. As an integrated academic health system, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Health System recently took the opportunity to broadly restructure funds-flow opportunities, so as to help align the strategic goals across all of the clinical department activities.",https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0b013e318159e1b8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18046122/,economics
"How can investments that would potentially improve a manufacturing plant's decision process be economically justified? What is the value of ""better information,"" ""more flexibility,"" or ""improved integration"" and the technologies that provide these effects? Technology investments such as improved process modelling, new real time historians and other databases, ""smart"" instrumentation, better data analysis and visualization software, and/or improved user interfaces often include these benefits as part of their valuation. How are these ""soft"" benefits to be converted to a quantitative economic return? Quantification is important if rational management decisions are to be made about the correct amount of money to invest in the technologies, and which technologies to choose among the many available ones. Modelling the plant operational decision cycle-detect, analyse, forecast, choose and implement--provides a basis for this economic quantification. In this paper a new economic model is proposed for estimation of the value of decision support investments based on their effect upon the uncertainty in forecasting plant financial performance. This model leads to quantitative benefit estimates that have a realistic financial basis. An example is presented demonstrating the application of the method.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isatra.2007.01.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17434170/,economics
"The hospital environment of most Western countries is currently undergoing dramatic changes. Competition among hospitals is increasing, and economic issues have become decisive factors for the allocation of medical care. Hospitals therefore require management tools to respond to these changes adequately. The balanced scorecard is a method of enabling development and implementation of a business strategy that equally respects the financial requirements, the needs of the customers, process development, and organizational learning. This method was used to derive generally valid success factors for hospital management based on an analysis of an academic hospital in Switzerland. Strategic management, the focus of medical services, customer orientation, and integration of professional groups across the hospital value chain were identified as success factors for hospital management.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s001040050575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10023551/,economics
"Appropriate discounting rules in economic evaluations have received considerable attention in the literature and in national guidelines for economic evaluations. Rightfully so, as discounting can be quite influential on the outcomes of economic evaluations. The most prominent controversies regarding discounting involve the basis for and height of the discount rate, whether costs and effects should be discounted at the same rate, and whether discount rates should decline or stay constant over time. Moreover, the choice for discount rules depends on the decision context one adopts as the most relevant. In this article, we review these issues and debates, and describe and discuss the current discounting recommendations of the countries publishing their national guidelines.

"Current budgetary restrictions in health systems have increased the influence of economic evaluation studies on decision making. Nevertheless, uncertainty about the parameters used in pharmacoeconomic models is inevitable and may affect the conclusions drawn. The present article aims to review the main methods proposed to quantify the uncertainty inherent in pharmacoeconomic evaluations applied to health technologies. The most accurate pharmacoeconomic estimations are obtained by probabilistic methods of uncertainty analysis such as Monte Carlo simulation, repetitive sampling and the Fieller method. Alternatives to these methods are calculation of the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve or net health benefit. Equally, the economic impact of uncertainty in the pharmacoeconomic models used in the decision-making process can be estimated by obtaining what is known as the value of perfect information.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s1130-6343(11)70016-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22445503/,economics
"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The purpose of the review is to examine the role of value-based medicine and its impact, or potential impact, on vitreoretinal interventions.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Value-based medicine integrates evidence-based data from clinical trials with the patient-perceived improvement in quality of life conferred by an intervention. Cost-utility analysis, the healthcare economic instrument used to create a value-based medicine database, is being increasingly used to study the cost-effectiveness of vitreoretinal interventions.
    


          Summary:

Laser surgical procedures, such as for diabetic retinopathy, threshold retinopathy of prematurity, and exudative macular degeneration appear to be especially cost-effective as a group.",https://doi.org/10.1097/01.icu.0000120675.27548.d5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15118501/,economics
"Healthcare expenditure (HCE) spent during an individual's last year of life accounts for a high share of lifetime HCE. This finding is puzzling because an investment in health is unlikely to have a sufficiently long payback period. However, Becker et al. (2007) and Philipson et al. (2010) have advanced a theory designed to explain high willingness to pay (WTP) for an extension of life close to its end. Their testable implications are complemented by the concept of 'pain of risk bearing' introduced by Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2006). They are tested using a discrete choice experiment performed in 2014, involving 1,529 Swiss adults. An individual setting where the price attribute is substantial out-of-pocket payment for a novel drug for treatment of terminal cancer is distinguished from a societal one, where it is an increase in contributions to social health insurance.

"Objective:
        
      
      The burden of illness that can be attributed to osteoarthritis is considerable and ever increasing. The aim of this systematic review is to analyze currently available data derived from cost-of-illness studies on the healthcare and non-healthcare costs of osteoarthritis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PubMed, Index Medicus Español (IME), and the Spanish Database of Health Sciences [Índice Bibliográfico Español en Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS)] were searched up to the end of April 2013. This study adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. Articles were reviewed and the study quality assessed by two independent investigators with consensus resolution of discrepancies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 39 studies that investigated the socio-economic cost of osteoarthritis. Only nine studies took a social perspective. Rather than estimating the incremental cost of osteoarthritis, nine studies estimated the total cost of treating patients with osteoarthritis without a control for comorbidity. The other 30 studies determined the incremental cost with or without a control group. Only nine studies assessed a comprehensive list of healthcare resources. The annual incremental healthcare costs of generalized osteoarthritis ranged from €705 to €19,715. The annual incremental non-healthcare-related costs of generalized osteoarthritis ranged from €432 to €11,956.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study concludes that the social cost of osteoarthritis could be between 0.25% and 0.50% of a country׳s GDP. This should be considered in order to foster studies that take into account both healthcare and non-healthcare costs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2014.10.012,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25511476/,economics

"Objectives:
        
      
      To explore the full economic impact, on both patients and government, as a result of COPD in the working age population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The economic impact of COPD due to medical treatment, impaired productivity and early retirement was assessed in a cross sectional cost analysis of the Dutch COPD population aged 45-64 years. The costing year was 2009 and input parameters were derived from both national data sources and the international COPD uncovered survey.
    


          Results:
        
      
      While direct medical costs for COPD patients of working age were relatively low (€ 91 million), the amount of lost productivity (income) due to early retirement (€ 223 million) exceeded over two times their medical costs. In addition, costs for the government were considerable because of lost tax revenues (€ 77 million) and COPD related disability pensions paid (€ 180 million). Apart from lost productivity due to early retirement, costs due to impaired productivity for working COPD patients were € 63 million.
    


          Conclusions:

"Background:
        
      
      The economic consequences of abortion care and abortion policies for individuals occur directly and indirectly. We lack synthesis of the economic costs, impacts, benefit or value of abortion care at the micro-level (i.e., individuals and households). This scoping review examines the microeconomic costs, benefits and consequences of abortion care and policies.
    


          Methods and findings:
        
      
      Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases and applied inclusion/exclusion criteria using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. For inclusion, studies must have examined at least one of the following outcomes: costs, impacts, benefits, and value of abortion care or abortion policies. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Of the 230 included microeconomic studies, costs are the most frequently reported microeconomic outcome (n = 180), followed by impacts (n = 84), benefits (n = 39), and values (n = 26). Individual-level costs of abortion-related care have implications for the timing and type of care sought, globally. In contexts requiring multiple referrals or follow-up visits, these costs are multiplied. The ways in which people pay for abortion-related costs are diverse. The intersection between micro-level costs and delay(s) to abortion-related care is substantial. Individuals forego other costs and expenditures, or are pushed further into debt and/or poverty, in order to fund abortion-related care. The evidence base on the economic impacts of policy or law change is from high-income countries, dominated by studies from the United States.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Delays underpinned by economic factors can thwart care-seeking, affect the type of care sought, and impact the gestational age at which care is sought or reached. The evidence base includes little evidence on the micro-level costs for adolescents. Specific sub-groups of abortion care-seekers (transgendered and/or disabled people) are absent from the evidence and it is likely that they may experience higher direct and indirect costs because they may experience greater barriers to abortion care.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34106927/,economics

"The US National Research Council defines abrupt climate change as a change of state that is sufficiently rapid and sufficiently widespread in its effects that economies are unprepared or incapable of adapting. This may be too restrictive a definition, but abrupt climate change does have implications for the choice between the main response options: mitigation (which reduces the risks of climate change) and adaptation (which reduces the costs of climate change). The paper argues that by (i) increasing the costs of change and the potential growth of consumption, and (ii) reducing the time to change, abrupt climate change favours mitigation over adaptation. Furthermore, because the implications of change are fundamentally uncertain and potentially very high, it favours a precautionary approach in which mitigation buys time for learning. Adaptation-oriented decision tools, such as scenario planning, are inappropriate in these circumstances. Hence learning implies the use of probabilistic models that include socioeconomic feedbacks.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2003.1242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14558908/,economics
"Caregiving issues are important for industrialized societies that have been undergoing population aging. In this article we consider caregiving as a factor in the outlook for midlife and older women with respect to economic security and economic advancement. We use demographic and economic data from the United States, France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, in particular to document the importance of continued labor force participation for older women to make ends meet in an era of high household costs of physician services, prescription drugs, and other health-related services, and uncertainties about pensions. Data on employment status, industry, and occupation of economically active women in comparison with men indicate the extent of both gender gaps and progress affecting women's resources. The research of Dr. Myrna Lewis was a stimulus to the present exploration. Our conclusion discusses the implications for women's welfare of policy initiatives relating to care of elderly disabled, including improving services to family caregivers, assuring social financing of formal care, raising local provisions to a national standard, and supporting women's return to the labor force after a period of caregiving. In the context of population aging and longevity, such initiatives are responsive to women's need for earned income to attain retirement security.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00981380902921732,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182981/,economics
